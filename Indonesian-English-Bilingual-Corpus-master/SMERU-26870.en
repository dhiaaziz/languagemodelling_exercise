ABSTRACT
ACCESS TO JUSTICE
EMPOWERING FEMALE HEADS OF HOUSEHOLD IN INDONESIA
Case Studies in Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam, West Java, West Kalimantan, and East Nusa Tenggara
This study was conducted as part of a collaborative research project led by the Supreme Court of Indonesia (Mahkamah Agung Republik Indonesia—MA) with the assistance of the Family Court of Australia and the AusAID-funded Indonesia Australia Legal Development Facility (IALDF) from 2007–2009
Four different research components made up the study that examined the level of satisfaction of justice seekers who were able to access the Indonesian courts for their family law matters and whether there were sections of the community who were unable to bring their family law cases to the courts and the reasons why
This report outlines one of the research components that examined the barriers faced by female heads of household in the PEKKA organization, the majority of whom live under the Indonesian poverty line, in bringing their family law cases to the courts as a way of assessing barriers generally faced by women, the poor or those living in remote areas
This report outlines the available statistics for female-headed households in Indonesia and the PEKKA organization whose members agreed to be surveyed as part of the study
It explores why it is important for Indonesian women and their children to have legal marriage, divorce and birth certificate and why these documents are important for female heads of household and their children in terms of accessing broader public services such as the government's poverty alleviation programs and education
This report presents the key research findings in relation to PEKKA members'
a) income levels and ability to access government poverty programs, 
b) ability to obtain legal marriage, divorce and birth certificates for themselves and their children (and considers reasons why access to government agencies and courts may be limited for PEKKA members), and
c) education levels and that of their dependants (and compares this with national data on educational attainment)
Keywords
female heads of household, marriage, divorce, birth certificate
INTRODUCTION 1.1 Research Objectives The first access and equity study in family law and birth certificate cases was undertaken in Indonesia from 2007–2009 and was a collaborative research effort coordinating four separate studies conducted over three years
It had the following aims
a) To provide the Supreme Court of Indonesia (Mahkamah Agung Republik Indonesia—MA) with empirical data on the quality of service provided to court users by the general and religious courts in the area of family law; 
b) To ascertain whether there are sections of the community, particularly those living under the Indonesian poverty line, who are unable or unwilling to access the services of the general and religious courts for their divorce and birth certificate cases and, if so, to identify the reasons why; 
c) To consider strategic policy responses (both financial and organizational) that MA should consider in order to provide universal access to the general and religious courts for people living below the poverty line or in remote communities
The study considered these issues with a particular focus on divorce cases (in both the general and religious courts) and the provision of birth certificate statements (Penetapan Akta Kelahiran) by the general courts; and 
d) To identify how the lack of a birth certificate affects an individual's access to broader public services, particularly education
The survey conducted by The SMERU Research Institute and PEKKA (Pemberdayaan Perempuan Kepala Keluarga, or Women Headed Household Empowerment) outlined in this report was one of four research components
The Access and Equity study was conducted as a collaborative research project led by MA and the AusAID Indonesia Australia Legal Development Facility
The recent project involved the following partners
a) MA (including the general and religious courts and the directorates-general that administratively support these two jurisdictions
Badilag and Badilum); 
b) Indonesia Australia Legal Development Facility staff;
c) The Family Court of Australia; 
d) The PEKKA NGO for Indonesian female heads of households; 
e) The PPIM (Center for the study of Islam and Society) at the State Islamic University (UIN) Syarif Hidayatullah, Jakarta; 
f) The SMERU Research Institute; 
g) Private and legal aid lawyers working in family law; and 
h) A number of individual researchers and gender specialists who contributed to the design and implementation of the Access and Equity study
1.2 Research Methodology This study was conducted using a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches
The qualitative study involved in-depth interviews using a structured list of questions, with key informants from religious courts, general courts, population and civil registries agencies, education agencies, health agencies, religious affairs offices (KUA), school managements, puskesmas (community health center) managements, prominent community figures, prominent traditional figures, prominent religious figures (kiai, ministers), kecamatan (subdistrict) staff, and heads of villages
The quantitative approach used questionnaires for 600 respondents who are members of the NGO PEKKA
The selection of PEKKA member respondents was purposive
PEKKA members who were chosen are less than 65 years old and responsible for one or more family members
The research areas was selected based on the number of PEKKA members, included areas within and outside Java, and consisted of areas from western Indonesia, central Indonesia, and eastern Indonesia
In each province, one kabupaten (district) was selected and within each kabupaten, two kecamatan were selected
The following issues were considered
(i) the areas included urban and rural regions; 
(ii) the number of respondents were proportional to the number of PEKKA members in the kecamatan; 
(iii) the kabupaten were selected in such a way that the Muslim and Christian/Catholic communities were proportionate; 
(iv) villages were selected randomly based on the average number of PEKKA members; and 
(v) PEKKA respondents were selected randomly according to the names of PEKKA members who were less than 65 years of age and were responsible for one or more family members
Six hundred and one PEKKA members were interviewed in four areas, as shown in Table 1
1.2.1 Overview of Study Areas The four study areas of Kabupaten Pidie in Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam, Kabupaten Karawang and Kabupaten Cianjur in West Java, Kabupaten Pontianak in West Kalimantan, and Kabupaten Flores Timur in East Nusa Tenggara have different socioeconomic characteristics
Table 2 shows that Kabupaten Kubu Raya is the largest research area but has the lowest population density, while Kabupaten Karawang is the smallest area but has the highest population density
The research area in Kabupaten Karawang is an urban area, while the other three are rural
Two kabupaten were chosen as the research areas in West Java because there were not enough respondents from PEKKA members in Kabupaten Karawang
Therefore, more respondents are chosen from Kabupaten Cianjur
In this report, only Kabupaten Karawang is mentioned
In West Kalimantan, due to the inadequate number of respondents in Kabupaten Pontianak, more PEKKA respondents were chosen from Kabupaten Kubu Raya
Considering that there were more respondents from the latter area, only Kabupaten Kubu Raya is mentioned in the following analysis
1.2.2 Profile of PEKKA in the Study Areas Based on Statistics Indonesia (BPS) data, the number of women-headed households is increasing every year
In 1985, 7.54% of households were headed by women, while in 1993 this number rose to 9.5% (Zulminarni, 2009)
In 2010, BPS (2009) estimated that there were 65 million households, 14% (9 million) of which are headed by women
PEKKA is an Indonesian NGO established in 2001 that works with over 12,000 female heads of household through a network of 500 PEKKA groups dispersed across the 330 villages in 8 Indonesian provinces, including NAD, West Java, Central Java, West Kalimantan, West Nusa Tenggara, NTT, North Maluku, and Southeast Sulawesi
PEKKA's vision is to build the capacity of female heads of household by
a) improving the welfare of female heads of household, b) facilitating improved access to resources by female heads of household, c) enabling female heads of household to actively participate in every phase of development in their area, d) raising the awareness of female heads of household of their rights as equal members of society, and e) empowering female heads of household to have control of their lives and the decisionmaking process within their families as well as within the society
Members of PEKKA are female heads of household through being widowed, divorced, abandoned, or single
Women who are married but are responsible for the household because the husband is ill or unable to work, or is incapacitated or working overseas and not supporting the household financially can also be members of PEKKA
The PEKKA membership provides a specific population to draw conclusions from regarding the barriers faced by Indonesian women who (i) may have experienced divorce, (ii) fall under the Indonesian poverty line, (iii) generally have not accessed the courts to formalize their divorce, and (iv) as women, share the gender of the majority of applicants bringing cases before the courts
PEKKA members experience significant social and economic disadvantages
By identifying the barriers this group faces in bringing their family law cases to the courts, it was considered that this may also reflect the barriers faced by other disadvantaged groups in Indonesia
Similarly, if the Indonesian courts could increase access for PEKKA members, access to the courts for other socially and economically disadvantaged groups would probably also increase
In order to empower its members, PEKKA engages its members in various activities in legal matters, education (keaksaraan fungsional, PAUD—pendidikan anak usia dini/early childhood education), politics, economy (savings and loan), and reproductive health
Activities in legal matters include 
(i) raising awareness about domestic violence, human trafficking, and marriage laws; 
(ii) holding discussions on legal matters in villages and kecamatan being under the care of PEKKA; 
(iii) establishing Multi Stakeholder Forum of law enforcement agencies at the kabupaten level; 
(iv) conducting courses on legal matters that can be accessed by women, including non-PEKKA members;
(v) conducting advocacy on the national action plan against human trafficking in collaboration with the kabupaten government; 
(vi) providing counseling to the community; 
(vii) facilitating PEKKA and non-PEKKA members to legalize their marriage and divorce status through the circuit courts of religious courts; and 
(viii) facilitating the settlement abuse cases inside or outside the court
Activities in economic matters include
(i) having savings and loan activities in their internal groups and microfinance bodies (LKM);
(ii) establishing and running the PEKKA group's common business; 
(iii) organizing training on entrepreneurship; and (iv) organizing training on bookkeeping and computer skills for the staff members of the microfinance bodies
a) Profile of PEKKA in Kabupaten Pidie PEKKA's activities in Kabupaten Pidie cannot be separated from PEKKA activities at the national level and at the NAD provincial level
The working visit from the World Bank and Komnas Perempuan (National Commission on Violence Against Women) to document the lives of widows because of conflict in Pidie at the end of 2000 was the pioneering activity from this empowerment program
Thus, PEKKA activities in Aceh generally, and in Pidie more specifically, have been running since PEKKA was established and PEKKA has effectively been carrying out empowerment activities in Aceh since the beginning of 2002
After the formation of PEKKA in Jakarta at the beginning of 2001, at the start of 2002 PEKKA groups were formed in five kabupaten in Aceh
Aceh Besar, Pidie, Bireun, Aceh Timur, and Aceh Barat Daya
In 2007, PEKKA was extended to Kabupaten Aceh Jaya and Singkil
By the end of December 2008, the working areas of PEKKA in Aceh consisted of nine kabupaten
Aceh Besar, Pidie, Bireun, Aceh Timur, Aceh Jaya, Nagan Raya, Aceh Barat Daya, Aceh Selatan, and Aceh Singkil
In Aceh, PEKKA eventually became not only a place to develop programs for female heads of households who were victims of conflict, but also developed programs especially to help areas affected by the tsunami at the end of 2004
Due to the complexity of the problem and the consequent need for a specific strategy and management that differed from other areas, the PEKKA National Secretariat decided to open a regional secretariat in Aceh, originally situated in Bireun but then moved to Aceh Besar in 2006, to increase the effectiveness of the development of these programs
This is the only PEKKA secretariat at the regional level
For the NAD Province, PEKKA activities grew rapidly, if considered from the number of groups and members
In 2002, there were 597 members in 24 groups
By the end of 2008, this had grown to 3,341 members in 120 groups spread over nine kabupaten
Meanwhile, in Kabupaten Pidie, according to the latest data in December 2008, there were 16 groups in 15 villages in two kecamatan, that is, in Kecamatan Mutiara Timur and Kecamatan Kembang Tanjong with 424 members
Pidie was selected as a PEKKA working area originally because of the large number of female-headed households or widows left by their husbands who died because of the long-term conflict
b) Profile of PEKKA in Kabupaten Karawang The PEKKA members in Kabupaten Karawang live in two kecamatan, namely Kecamatan Telagasari (246 female heads of household) and Kecamatan Tempuran (67 female heads of household)
Not every member of PEKKA is a female head of household, for some of the members are married
There are 85 female heads of household in Kecamatan Telagasari and 30 in Kecamatan Tempuran
The research areas were Kecamatan Telagasari and Kecamatan Tempuran, which consist of 14 villages each
There is a little difference between the number of male and female residents in the two kecamatan, with the number of males slightly higher than that of females
The residents' livelihood is based on farming and a large number of them work as farm hands
They also conduct small-scale trade, open food stalls, or hawk vegetables or cakes
Some of the female heads of households work as washing laborers for more well-off families or as small-scale laborers
Some residents (approximately 42%) in Kecamatan Telagasari have moved from the agricultural sector to the informal trade sector
The respondents from Kecamatan Tempuran are more likely to be involved in farming
However, a number of them have left their hometown to work in Saudi Arabia
One informal sector which is sought by women in Karawang is to work as a migrant worker, particularly in Saudi Arabia
With a low level of education and limited skills, they can obtain a reasonably large income if they work in Saudi Arabia as domestic workers
The development and empowerment from PEKKA in Kabupaten Karawang of widows or divorcees have included a number of villages in the two kecamatan of Kecamatan Telagasari and Kecamatan Tempuran
The majority of these women have school-aged children and some still even seek to earn a living for their grandchildren left by their parents who have divorced or moved away to work as migrant workers
Poverty has become a major problem because the majority of women are farm hands or small-scale traders with a low income, under Rp30,000 per day
This is despite the fact that they have to provide for about five family members
According to an official from the local KUA in Karawang, contract marriages have long been practiced in Bogor, Cianjur, and Sukabumi
This form of marriage contradicts the existing norms and religious values in Indonesia
Based on the Marriage Law, a contract marriage is not legal since it is not registered at the KUA
Contract marriages are often practiced by foreign tourists, especially those from the Middle East who marry a local woman, with the help of an intermediary, for a certain period of time
When the time is up, as both parties have initially agreed, they will separate
At the beginning of the contract, the “groom-to-be” has to give the contract wife a certain amount of money as a dowry through the intermediary
A contract marriage involves someone acting as a priest, some witnesses, and a dowry
However, since the marriage is not registered at the KUA, there is no legal protection for the “wife”
The Indonesian Ulemas Council (MUI) has strictly forbidden contract marriages since 1997, but they are still practiced
As can be seen in Chapter III, 49% of PEKKA survey respondents in Cianjur marry under the legal age of marriage which is 16 years of age
Contract marriages have been commercialized since there is a deal between the intermediary and the “groom-to-be” regarding the amount of the dowry
The contract wife will receive only half of the total amount
The other half is shared by the intermediary and the recruiters of contract wives from Cianjur and Sukabumi
The value of the contract is around US$200, not including the priest fee
None of the PEKKA survey respondents in Cianjur were parties to a contract marriage
c) Profile of PEKKA in Kabupaten Kubu Raya The formation of PEKKA in West Kalimantan Province came about because of the existence of female-headed households as a result of interethnic conflict in Sampit
The majority of PEKKA members in West Kalimantan (75%) are widowers whose husbands have died
The remainder are divorced women (15%), unmarried women (5%), or women whose husbands are sick, are working in Malaysia, or are unemployed (5%)
Most PEKKA members have completed primary school and are farmers
PEKKA members in West Kalimantan are spread across three kabupaten/kota (city)
Kota Pontianak, Kabupaten Pontianak, and Kabupaten Kubu Raya
PEKKA in Kabupaten Pontianak is based in Kecamatan Siantan, while PEKKA in Kabupaten Kubu Raya is based in Kecamatan Sungai Raya and Kecamatan Rasau Jaya
Based on the socioeconomic and geographical conditions of each region, PEKKA activities in West Kalimantan are divided into three themes
The first theme is law and politics
Activities in this area are concentrated in the Kota Pontianak area as well as in Kecamatan Siantan of Kabupaten Pontianak
The second theme is education
The main region for this is Kecamatan Sungai Raya
The third theme is business and economic development whose activities are concentrated in Kecamatan Rasau Jaya and Kecamatan Sungai Raya, particularly Desa (Village) Limbung
While members of the savings and borrowings group are women from PEKKA, the microfinance division consists of PEKKA groups within a particular area
Each group gives a base contribution of Rp50,000 as well as compulsory contributions, the value of which is determined by the group and ranges between Rp5,000 and Rp10,000
Group members are also able to use savings from the microfinance division by providing savings in advance
The group then forwards this to the microfinance division
The principle of this activity is that if members are unable to pay, other group members pay on their behalf, so it very much depends on the group's cohesiveness
At the end of March 2009, PEKKA law facilitators had assisted in eight cases of divorce among PEKKA members
In addition to the law course, PEKKA also runs legal dialogues with law enforcement agencies
The results of the legal dialogues are then socialized to other villages with the help of the law facilitators
Activities in the legal field are complemented by political education and training for leaders
In addition to this, dialogues were held with walikota (heads of kota, or mayors) and legislative candidates prior to the 2009 Kabupaten Kubu Raya and national elections
Based on the surrounding land conditions, the Rasau Jaya and Limbung regions (where the ‘Kerukunan' and ‘Sekuntum Melati' groups live) are appropriate for agricultural businesses because they were the areas where PEKKA operate, with the theme of economic empowerment in agriculture
In addition to cultivating crops, PEKKA's founding group in this area also runs a credit operation for farming and household equipment
The capital for these operations was obtained through group borrowings or the microfinance division
The lands owned by the majority of PEKKA members in the Limbung area are peatlands, which are wet and, according to members, only suitable for growing kangkung
If they want to grow rice, they must borrow unused lands from others
The produce from rice farming is then sold and the money received halved; one half is used for farming and the other half is for the group because the group's money is used to buy seeds
The obstacle facing the group is very poor road access
The group still uses simple land and crop cultivation methods and the seeds are not high quality, but have been adjusted to the type of land
Unlike the land in the Limbung area, the land in the Rasau Jaya area is very good for cultivating crops
The PEKKA group in this area, particularly Rasau Jaya 3, has worked with agricultural businesspeople with operations covering various types of crops
PEKKA members harvest watermelon and tomato seeds under the guidance of these businesspeople
The PEKKA women get 30% of the profit obtained from the watermelon and tomato crops
The funds come from the Direct Community Aid program delivered through PEKKA's microfinance division
Desa Mekarsari, Desa Kuala Dua, Desa Kapur, Desa Sungai Asam, and Desa Sungai Ambangah are the focus of the Education activities theme
The main PEKKA activity in these villages is the establishment of Early Childhood Education
Associated with the ethnic and tribal diversity in Kabupaten Kubu Raya, generally, there are still strong negative views about the Madurese and discrimination against the ethnic Chinese
The PEKKA National Secretariat has also experienced difficulty in organizing groups in Madurese relocation areas
This is not only because the villages are far away, but also because a large proportion of the Madurese community cannot speak Indonesian and are illiterate
The community itself is also very sensitive to matters relating to aid and conflicts easily arise if some sections of the community receive aid, while others do not
This is the main obstacle to the establishment of PEKKA in the area, given that only female heads of households can become PEKKA members
d) Profile of PEKKA in Kabupaten Flores Timur Within Kabupaten Flores Timur, Kecamatan Kelubagolit and Kecamatan Ile Boleng were chosen to be the study areas
The two kecamatan are around 55 to 60 kilometers away from the capital of the kabupaten, or a 3- to 3.5-hour journey by land and sea
PEKKA in NTT commenced in 2002, from the initial idea of the National Secretariat in Jakarta to work with female heads of household in order to improve their welfare
By joining the PEKKA group, the women can improve their skills
One rationale for establishing the PEKKA group in NTT Province is that traditionally, women have been regarded as secondclass citizens
Many of their husbands went to Malaysia to work and then remarried
In NTT, PEKKA field workers introduced themselves to the residents of Kecamatan Ile Boleng and Kecamatan Kelubagolit by stating the PEKKA vision and mission and programs
At the end of 2008, there were 33 PEKKA field workers and 24 groups with 631 members in Kecamatan Kelubagolit, while in Kecamatan Ile Boleng, there were 25 groups with 517 members
POVERTY LEVEL AND EDUCATION ATTAINMENT This chapter discusses the poverty and education levels of PEKKA members and the level of education attained by the family members of a PEKKA member
To analyze the poverty level, the national poverty line according to BPS and the international $2-a-day poverty line are used
2.1 Poverty Level Generally, poverty is defined as the limited ability to reasonably fulfill basic living needs
This limited ability can take various forms, including limitations with regard to income, skills, health, share of economic assets, and access to information
Based on this general definition, poverty tends to be measured from a material perspective, using a monetary approach, such as comparing the income level or consumption level of a household with the minimal living needs, both in terms of food- and nonfood-related goods, which are considered essential and necessary for a certain time period in order to live reasonably
In the survey, PEKKA respondents were asked questions about both their income and consumption/expenditure
As presented in Table 3, the income data is lower than the expenditure data in most of the study areas
There are two possibilities for why this occurs
First, a household may have a tendency to lower their level of income for reasons of privacy or feeling of insecure towards the enumerator (the person interviewing the survey respondent)
Second, their income may indeed be lower than their expenditure, in which case they would have to fulfill their daily needs by borrowing, selling, or pawning their assets
It is difficult to establish which of these reasons is responsible for the differences between the income and expenditure data
However, in Indonesia, monetary poverty is usually measured by using expenditure data, as an approximation of household income
This expenditure data is compared with the rupiah exchange rate band which is needed to fulfill minimum living needs and is known as the poverty line
People who have expenditure lower than the poverty line are categorized as poor
The poverty line officially used in Indonesia is the poverty line as measured by BPS
Besides the national poverty line, for an international comparison, there is the international poverty lines of US$1 PPP and US$2 PPP
Poverty is multidimensional
Aside from being measured using a monetary approach, poverty can also be measured using other approaches, such as access to education and health services, as well as other basic service facilities and infrastructure; ownership of valuable goods/assets; access to public information; opportunities to participate in social activities; and opportunities to voice opinions on political matters
Since the way poverty is viewed and measured can vary, as can the factors which make up the basis of the measurements, the result of the measurements can be different, although in general, there is a correlation or interdependence between the different measurements
In the following poverty analysis of PEKKA members across four study areas, it is important to distinguish between the consumption and nonconsumption aspects of poverty
Consumption is measured based on the ability of an individual or household to fulfill basic needs, both in terms of food and other items, as determined by the poverty line, whereas the nonconsumption aspect of poverty can be analyzed according to the access of the poor to basic services and government programs
In terms of the consumption pattern and economic condition of PEKKA members (based on expenditure data) in the study regions, the poverty lines used in the analysis are the national poverty line for 2009, at Rp200,262 per person per month, and the international poverty line of US$2, or equivalent to Rp286,892 per person per month for rural areas and Rp404,715 per person per month for urban areas
Table 4 shows that more than half (55%) of PEKKA members in the four study regions live below the 2009 national poverty line of Rp200,262 per person per month
This group of PEKKA members represents the poorest 14% of the Indonesian population as determined by BPS
If the international poverty line of US$2 is used, 79% of PEKKA members live below the poverty line
Due to the low level of income (measured from expenditure) of PEKKA members and the fact that PEKKA members are responsible for living costs, including education and health, for their family members, various measures are needed to empower PEKKA members, in terms of education, health, skills, and access to information and programs
Various government programs to deal with poverty, including social safety net and social protection programs, together with development in various sectors to increase economic growth and thus create employment, reduced the poverty rate to 17.75% by 2006
Moreover, by March 2009, the poverty level had declined from 15.42% (2008) to 14.15% (2009) (see Appendix Table A1)
In 2009, the percentages of the population living below the poverty line in NAD and NTT were 22% and 23% respectively, significantly higher than the national figure of 14% of the population living below the poverty line in Indonesia
The percentages of the population living below the poverty line in West Java and West Kalimantan were 12% and 9%, slightly below the national figure of 14% of the Indonesian population (Appendix Table A1)
Aside from the poor population, there are also people who are considered vulnerable as their level of expenditure is close to the poverty line
This group will easily move out of or fall into poverty if there are fluctuations in prices
With regards to nonconsumption poverty, this report analyzes the ability of PEKKA members to access three government programs aimed at poverty reduction, i.e., Raskin (Rice for Poor Families), Bantuan Langsung Tunai (BLT—Unconditional Cash Transfer), and Jaminan Kesehatan Masyarakat (Jamkesmas—Community Health Insurance)
The Raskin program is a national program aimed at helping poor households fulfill their food needs and reduce their financial burden by providing subsidized rice
The program is the continuation of the Operasi Pasar Khusus (OPK—Special Market Operation) program launched in 1998, as part of the Social Safety Net (JPS)
In 2002, the central government changed the name of the program from OPK to Raskin in order to reflect the change in the program's nature
The monthly quota of rice per poor household was originally set at 10 kg but in subsequent years varied between 10 kg and 20 kg, and in 2007, once again became 10 kg
In 2007, each targeted household should have received 10 kg of rice each month with the price of Rp1,000 per kg at the distribution point
Badan Urusan Logistik (BULOG—State Logistics Agency) is responsible for distributing the rice to poor households from the distribution points
The method of targeting recipients was also changed in 2006
Targeting had previously relied on data for preprosperous families (keluarga prasejahtera, or KPS) and prosperous level 1 (keluarga sejahtera 1, or KS-1,) families collected by Badan Koordinasi Keluarga Berencana Nasional (BKKBN—National Family Planning Coordinating Board)
Since 2006, BPS data for poor households collected in the 2005 Household Socioeconomic Survey (PSE05) has been used
Most of the PEKKA members surveyed living below poverty line were Raskin recipients
In the four kabupaten, on average, there were only 6% PEKKA members living below poverty line who did not receive the rice subsidy program
BLT is a government assistance program within the framework of compensation for a reduction in fuel subsidies
In October 2005 and June 2008, the Government of Indonesia increased the price of fuel (through removing the fuel subsidy) which created a burden for people
To ease this burden, the government issued Inpres No
12 of 2005 and Inpres No
3 of 2008 on The Implementation of BLT to Poor Households
A poor household was defined as a household that has a per capita monthly income of Rp175,000 or less
They are identified by BPS using the proxy-means testing method
For this purpose, the government set aside compensation funds for approximately 19.1 million poor households (2005) and 19.02 million poor households (2008)
Each poor household received Rp100,000 per month provided quarterly in 2005, while in 2008, each poor household received Rp100,000 per month provided for seven months
The disbursement of BLT funds to poor households was undertaken by the National Postal Agency (PT
Pos Indonesia) through their branches across Indonesia
From the table above, 33% of PEKKA members living below the poverty line did not receive BLT
Jamkesmas is a new system of health services for the poor that started in January 2008
It is also the continuation of the Asuransi Kesehatan Masyarakat Miskin (Askeskin—Health Insurance for the Poor) program but uses a different implementation mechanism
This program prioritized poor pregnant mothers in order to reduce mortality rates for mothers and their babies
The target of this national program is 18.9 million households or 76.4 million residents who are very poor, poor, or quite poor
The program provides health services for inpatients/outpatients in puskesmas, third-class health services for inpatients, and specialist treatment for outpatients in government hospital
A similar picture can be seen in the health program for the poor (Jamkesmas), as for the cash transfer program
Thirty-four percent of PEKKA members surveyed living below poverty line did not have access to Jamkesmas
This increased to 48% of PEKKA members surveyed living below poverty line in Kabupaten Kubu Raya
A detailed discussion on poverty levels in each kabupaten in terms of monetary poverty and access to the government programs is carried out in the following subsections
2.1.1 Poverty Level in Kabupaten Pidie In Table 4, of the 164 PEKKA member respondents in Kabupaten Pidie, 79 respondents, or 48%, live below the 2009 national poverty line of Rp200,262 per capita per month
The average expenditure per capita per month of PEKKA respondents in Pidie is Rp240,742, slightly more than the 2009 national poverty line
The average income per capita per month for respondents in Pidie is Rp144,201
The $2 international poverty line applied in Kabupaten Pidie is based on the calculation of purchasing power parity in rural areas
Since the $2 international poverty line is higher than the national poverty line, the percentage of poor members increased
Using this international poverty line, 71% of PEKKA members in Pidie live below the poverty line
In terms of job type, the majority of PEKKA members living below the national poverty line work as farmers (77%), with the remainder working as farm hands (14%), professional workers, informal traders, informal laborers, handicrafts workers, or workers in the services sector
Similarly, for PEKKA members living above the Indonesian poverty line, the majority work as farmers (73%), with the remainder working as farm hands (11%), informal laborers, handicrafts workers, or informal traders
Farmers in Pidie are farmers who work the land but do not sell their produce and use it for their own needs (subsistence farmers)
These farmers only sell their rice if there is an excess after they have filled their stocks for the time until the next harvest
For these farmers, rice is their life
They are not concerned with whether they have money or income
What is important to them is that they have rice available in the kitchen
The PEKKA members surveyed in Pidie combine a small expenditure or income with a large number of family members
The relationship between poverty and the size of a family is well documented
The more dependants within a family, the larger the burden on the head of the family to support the family
The average number of dependants for PEKKA respondents is 3.74 persons (4 including the respondent)
The majority of PEKKA members living below the national poverty line are responsible for five dependants, while PEKKA members living above the Indonesian poverty line are responsible for two dependants
In Pidie, generally, the poor have reasonably good access to government programs, as can be seen in the three tables in the previous section (Tables 5–7)
All respondents living under the Indonesian poverty line (48% of all respondents) stated that they received Raskin
They explained that Raskin was received by almost all village residents
However, when the survey was taking place in March–April 2009, they claimed that they had not received Raskin since the beginning of 2009
Access for PEKKA survey respondents to BLT and Jamkesmas differ from that of Raskin because their targeting systems are different
For BLT 2005, 4% of poor respondents did not receive BLT
However in 2008, the percentage of PEKKA respondents living under the Indonesian poverty line who did not receive BLT rose to 8%
One of the causes for this was that the village head (geuchik) changed the list of recipients because the quota from the kabupaten office of BPS also changed
The geuchik and village apparatus visited some respondents for verification; however, their names were not included in the list
While for Jamkesmas, 9% of PEKKA respondents living under the Indonesian poverty line were unable to access free health treatment
2.1.2 Poverty Level in Kabupaten Karawang Data in Table 4 shows that there are 48% of the respondents in Kabupaten Karawang who live below the national poverty line
The average expenditure for PEKKA respondents in Kabupaten Karawang is Rp262,972 per person per month and the average income is Rp283,998 per person per month
Based on kabupaten characteristics, Kabupaten Karawang is an urban area
Eighty-seven percent of PEKKA members surveyed in Kabupaten Karawang live below the US$2 PPP international poverty line
Respondents above the national poverty line are more likely to work in the informal trade sector (58%), while respondents living below the national poverty line generally work as hired laborers in the informal sector (31%) or as farm hands (24%)
One characteristic of industrial regions is the development of the trade sector, especially with the emergence of traders in the informal sector and the services sector, as well as informal laborers
The majority of respondents who live in kota have a low education level, are also elderly, and, therefore, have very limited choices in terms of employment
The respondents work as traders, trading food, drinks, or vegetables
They open food stalls (warung) or travel around the village selling their goods
Not many PEKKA members work in the agricultural sector
The changes in the orientation of development in Kabupaten Karawang appear to have impacted on the types of residents' livelihoods
In Karawang, PEKKA members surveyed who live below the Indonesian poverty line have more dependants than those living above the poverty line
The majority of PEKKA members surveyed who live below the Indonesian poverty line are responsible for four dependants in the family, while most of the PEKKA members surveyed living above the Indonesian poverty line have three dependants
PEKKA members' dependants are not only their own children, but also their nieces and nephews, parents, grandchildren, and/or in-laws, with the total number of dependants ranging from one to nine
To reduce the burden on poor families, the government has created various social protection programs so that these people can survive
The social protection program that has the highest coverage in Kabupaten Karawang is Raskin (Table 5)
The number of respondents living below the national poverty line who receive Raskin is 53 PEKKA members (96%)
The percentage of PEKKA members living below the national poverty line who received BLT is even lower as can be seen in Table 6
In 2005, the percentage of PEKKA members surveyed living below the Indonesian poverty line who received BLT was 55%
This number increased to 56% for the BLT 2008
Sixty-five percent of PEKKA members living below the national poverty line received Jamkesmas
Besides obtaining assistance from government programs, some respondents receive assistance from private organizations, such as PEKKA, who give assistance in the form of savings and lending activities, training to increase political awareness, and skills training
The lending and savings activities are quite popular with the community in Kecamatan Talagasari which is one of the areas in Karawang where PEKKA operates
With this activity, almost all PEKKA members can develop small businesses to pay for their family's living needs
PEKKA has also developed early childhood education, with a PEKKA member as the tutor
PEKKA also provides skills training, such as training on how to put on make up for weddings and how to make handicrafts
This skills training increases self confidence, so PEKKA members can be optimistic in increasing their standard of living
2.1.3 Poverty Level in Kabupaten Kubu Raya Table 4 shows that 99 PEKKA member respondents, or 64%, in Kabupaten Kubu Raya are below the 2009 national poverty line
The average expenditure of PEKKA members surveyed in Kabupaten Kubu Raya is Rp220,139 per person per month
This money is used to purchase daily needs and to pay for electricity, transport, and school fees for their children
The average income of PEKKA members in Kabupaten Kubu Raya is Rp142,483 per person per month
The international US$2 (PPP) poverty line for rural areas is equivalent to Rp286,892
The data shows that 79% of PEKKA members surveyed in Kabupaten Kubu Raya live below this international poverty line
The agricultural sector plays a big role in the economic development of Kabupaten Kubu Raya
The majority of PEKKA members living below the national poverty line (59%) work as farmers or farm hands, and 20% work as informal traders, such as warung or kiosk owners selling food or other daily necessities
Poor PEKKA members who work as farmers generally store their produce, namely rice, for their own consumption needs
If they have a sudden need, they sell their produce as much as the amount of money they need
There are a number of plywood manufacturing industries in Kabupaten Kubu Raya, particularly in Kecamatan Sungai Raya
However, only 7% of PEKKA members below the poverty line worked as wage earners/informal workers
The results of the qualitative observation in the field show that some PEKKA members previously worked as laborers in some of the plywood manufacturing factories
However, because of the global financial crisis in November 2008, some of the factories closed or laid off some of their workers, including PEKKA members
The factories able to continue were those that had their own forestry industries
After losing their jobs as factory workers, some of the PEKKA members went back to working in the agricultural sector
The number of dependants affects PEKKA members' ability to fulfill their daily needs
Poor PEKKA members are more likely to have higher numbers of dependants
The majority of PEKKA members surveyed who live below the Indonesian poverty line are responsible for four dependants in the family, while most of the PEKKA members surveyed who live above the Indonesian poverty line have two dependants
Table 5 shows the percentage of PEKKA members living below poverty line in Kabupaten Kubu Raya who did not receive Raskin
From 99 PEKKA members who live below the poverty line, 83% receive rice from Raskin
The high proportion of Raskin recipients is caused by the Raskin distribution system whereby the rice is divided evenly to all residents who need it, as explained by one respondent in Desa K, Kecamatan Sungai Raya, a PEKKA member who represented the local community in supervising the distribution of Raskin rice
Table 6 shows that the number of BLT recipients in Kabupaten Kubu Raya from 2005 to 2008 did not change, which is 61% of the total sample in Kabupaten Kubu Raya
Some PEKKA members who received Jamkesmas in 2008 did not receive it in 2009, with the reason being given that recipients had to take turns
From Table 7, we can see that only 52% of PEKKA members surveyed who lived below the Indonesian poverty line in Kabupaten Kubu Raya received Jamkesmas
Some respondents did not receive any assistance as they were thought to be well off
Interviews with these respondents showed that because they live with their relatives and work, unpaid, as nannies for their relatives, the local RT management considers the family is not eligible to receive Raskin or Jamkesmas
However, if the size of payments for dependants and monthly expenditure is taken into account, these respondents would fall into the group of people eligible to receive government assistance programs
2.1.4 Poverty Level in Kabupaten Flores Timur Table 4 shows that of 167 PEKKA members surveyed in Kabupaten Flores Timur, 99 respondents, or 59%, live below the 2009 national poverty line
The average expenditure of PEKKA members surveyed in Kabupaten Flores Timur is Rp240,401 per person per month and the average income is Rp275,525 per person per month
About 79% of PEKKA members surveyed in Kabupaten Flores Timur live under the US$2 (PPP) international poverty line
This shows that the expenditure of almost all PEKKA members is less than US$2 (PPP) per person per day
Low income, discerned from low expenditure, means that PEKKA members seek other sources to fulfill their families' daily living needs
If these other sources are not enough, the respondents who were contacted generally borrowed money from their respective groups
This can be seen from the expenditure data of respondents who make loan repayments to their groups
In terms of job types, 41% of the poor PEKKA members in this area work in the services sector or as handicraft makers, 14% work as informal traders, and the remainder work as paid or informal laborers, farmers, professional workers, farm hands, or village staff
These types of nonpermanent jobs make their economic livelihoods vulnerable, which is worsened by the large number of dependants
Thus, PEKKA members need to be empowered so that they can increase their living standard
For example, information should be given about family planning, healthy living, the cooperative system, capital loans, training, legal assistance, or assistance in gaining access to programs
The majority of PEKKA members surveyed who live below the Indonesian poverty line are responsible for four dependants in the family, while most of the PEKKA members surveyed who live above the Indonesian poverty line have three dependants
Table 5 shows that from the 99 PEKKA members surveyed who live below the national poverty line in Kabupaten Flores Timur, the majority (98%) receive Raskin
Table 6 shows that 56% of PEKKA members surveyed living below the poverty line received BLT in 2005
Sixty-two percent of PEKKA members surveyed living below the poverty line received BLT in 2008
Sixty percent of PEKKA members surveyed who live below the national poverty line in Kabupaten Flores Timur receive Jamkesmas (Table 7)
This is lower than the percentage for Raskin
Box 1 shows the impact for poor female heads of household of not obtaining Jamkesmas
2.2 Education Level and Education Attainment of PEKKA Members and Their Dependants 2.2.1 Education Level of PEKKA Members The education level of PEKKA members in the four study regions is generally very low
Of 601 respondents, 24% have never been to school and 34% did go to school but did not graduate from primary school, while 28% graduated from primary school
Despite these facts, some PEKKA members have a relatively good education background
Some have graduated from senior high school, or even university
PEKKA members who have a relatively high education can be empowered as group organizers who can share their knowledge and skills with other members of their group
The level of education of PEKKA members is generally lower than the national education level (see Table 8)
The number of PEKKA members who did not receive any education or did not complete primary education is 24 % and 34% respectively, much higher than the national figures of 7.57% and 20.37%
Moreover, looking at higher education establishments, the gap is even wider
Only 28% of PEKKA members completed primary education, while the national figure is 31.19%
The number of PEKKA members who finished junior high school is only 7%, while the national figure is 17.49%
For senior high school graduates or above, the figure is 7% for PEKKA members and 23.37% for national level
In Kabupaten Pidie, the percentage of PEKKA members who have never attended school is 29%, while the percentage of those who did not complete primary school is 21%
These percentages show that there are still high numbers of less educated PEKKA members
The percentage of PEKKA members who finished their primary school is 27%, while the percentage of those who finished their junior high school is 10%
The number of PEKKA members who finished their senior high school or higher degree, which is 13%, is higher than the number of those who finished their junior high school
In Kabupaten Karawang, PEKKA members also have a poor level of education
The table above shows that the percentage for PEKKA members who never graduated from primary school education level is the highest (40%)
Thirty-four percent of PEKKA members graduated only from primary school and 13% have never been to school
Eight percent of PEKKA members graduated from junior high school and 5% from senior high school or above
However, we identified that only one respondent in Kabupaten Karawang has an undergraduate degree
In Kabupaten Kubu Raya, the education level of PEKKA members is also very low, with 34% never having gone to school, 43% not having graduated from primary school, and 15% having graduated from primary school
The percentage of PEKKA members who finished their junior high school is 3% and those who finished their senior high school or above is 4%
Compared to other survey kabupaten, the level of educational attainment of PEKKA members in Kabupaten Kubu Raya is low
This could be due to the fact that the average age for PEKKA members in this kabupaten is higher than in other kabupaten
In Kabupaten Flores Timur, the percentage of PEKKA members who never attended school is 17%
The highest percentage is for PEKKA members who completed their primary education level, 37%, followed by those who did not finished their primary school, 34%
For PEKKA members who graduated from junior high school and senior high school or above, the percentage is similar, 7%
We identified that there are two respondents in this kabupaten that have a diploma degree
Since education attainment for PEKKA members is relatively low, it affects their opinion about whether their sons or daughters will be educated if their household income is constrained (gender preferment in education), as the table below shows
If funds for their children's education are limited, parents in Kabupaten Pidie prioritize educating their sons to the highest level possible (67%)
Reasons for this include that the sons will become heads of families (65%), their sons will have a better future (13%), and their daughters will become wives and homemakers (10%), and various other reasons
Parents who choose to educate their daughters to the highest level possible if funds for education are limited state that their reasons are that girls are more diligent and smarter (56%) and that girls with an education also have the opportunity to get work (21%)
In Kabupaten Karawang, 79 % of parents prefer to educate their sons to the highest possible level if their funds are limited
Reasons for this were that sons will become heads of families (63%), sons will be responsible for their parents and family (25%), and girls will become wives or homemakers (5%), and various other reasons
Fifty percent of parents who choose to send their daughters to school to the highest level possible if their funds are limited give the reason that girls are more diligent and smarter, while 29% said that girls with a good education had opportunities
In Kabupaten Kubu Raya, if their funds are limited, most parents (74%) prefer their sons to go to school to the highest level possible
The reasons for this, according to respondents, are that sons will become heads of families (51%), daughters will become wives or homemakers (19%), sons will have a better future (13%), and a number of other reasons
Parents who prefer their daughters to go to school to the highest level possible gave reasons that girls are more diligent and smarter (28%), girls can help their parents and younger siblings (15%), girls pay more attention to their families (13%), and various other reasons
If their funds are limited, 74% of parents in Kabupaten Flores Timur prefer to educate their sons to the highest possible level of schooling
The reasons given for this are that sons will be responsible for their parents and family (21%), sons will take care of their parents when their parents are getting old (21%), sons will become heads of families (20%), daughters will become wives and homemakers (18%), and the rest of the respondents gave various other answers
Some parents (26%) prefer to educate their daughters to the highest possible level if their funds are limited, with the reasons being that girls pay more attention to their families (32%) and girls will help their parents and younger siblings (20%)
There are 1,870 dependants for the 601 PEKKA members (3.1 dependants per PEKKA member)
In order to compare the PEKKA data with national data, only the educational attainment of PEKKA dependants who are ten years old and above is taken into consideration
PEKKA dependants generally have a lower level of educational attainment than that experienced nationally
In Kabupaten Pidie, the educational attainment of the PEKKA members' dependants is generally low
Thirty percent of these dependants have never gone to school, 8% have not or never completed primary education, 4% finished primary school, and 36% finished junior high school (Table 10)
The percentage of those who finished senior high school or above reaches 22%
This figure is slightly below the national figure which shows that 23.37% of people aged ten or above have completed high school or above
Moreover, the number of PEKKA members' dependants who do not have any education is much higher than that of the national scale, 30% compared to 7.57%
In Kabupaten Karawang, the educational attainment of PEKKA members' dependants varied, starting from those who did not receive any education to those who completed their college degree
However, most of them are not well educated
Table 4 shows that 18% of PEKKA members' dependants never had any education, 6% did not finish or have not finished primary education, 35% finished their primary school, 27% completed junior high school, and 15% finished senior high school or above
The education attainment of the PEKKA members' dependants is slightly better than that at the national level for primary education and junior high school
The urban areas where they reside have made it possible for them to pursue better education
However, for senior high school education or above, the percentage of PEKKA members' dependants is only 15%, much lower than that at the national level, which reaches 23.37%
In Kabupaten Kubu Raya, the educational attainment of the dependants of PEKKA members is generally low
Twenty-seven percent of them have never been to school, 15% did not finish or have not finished primary school, 25% completed primary education, 17% finished their junior high school, and only 15% finished senior high school or above
The number of those who finished senior high school or above is lower than the national level, which reaches 23.37%
In Kabupaten Flores Timur, the educational attainment of the dependants of PEKKA members is the lowest compared to the other three research areas
More than half of them did not complete primary education, while 41% of them never attended school
Only 27% finished primary school, 13% finished junior high school, and 7% completed senior high school education or above
The figure for those who did not receive any education is much higher than that at the national level
Educational attainment at primary and high school levels also fall behind national levels
This shows that education in Kabupaten Flores Timur still lags behind at all levels
In all research areas, the educational attainment of the dependants of PEKKA members, especially at the levels of high school, is still very low
One of the ways to improve this condition is to carry out educational equivalence programmes (pendidikan kesetaraan Paket A and B), with the assistance of nongovernment organizations in collaboration with local educational institutions
2.2.3 Educational Costs of the PEKKA Members' Dependants The education level of PEKKA members is generally very low, while the poverty rate of these people in the four study regions is generally high
Across the four study areas, there are 788 dependants that are still at school on different levels of education
playgroup, kindergarten, primary school, junior high school, and senior high school
There are 719 dependants who are still studying in primary school, junior high school, senior high school
Some of them go to a private school, while others going to a public school
We will focus our analysis of education costs on these three school age groups, the type of school, and the average income per capita of their mother (PEKKA member)
The average education cost in a year is derived from nine school costs
school fee (SPP), cost of staying in a boarding school/house (if required; because the school is some distance away from the child's home), stationery, curriculum books, transportation cost, uniform/shoes, compulsory donations to the school, snacks, and extracurricular activities
In general, every village in Indonesia has at least one primary school
Since the primary school is located within walking distance in all four survey areas, parents do not need to pay for the rent of a boarding house
In Kabupaten Pidie, the cost for snacks is remarkably the largest expense for a PEKKA member with dependants at primary school, for 84% of the total educational cost is spent on this item annually
The second highest expense is from uniform and shoes
The average annual cost of educating one primary school student in Pidie takes about 103% of the annual per capita income of PEKKA members (see Tables 3 and 11)
Primary school dependants in Kabupaten Pidie mostly go to school on foot with an average distance to school of one kilometer
In Kabupaten Karawang, the highest cost in educating a PEKKA member dependant in primary school is also the daily expense for buying snacks
The second highest cost is for uniform and shoes
The average annual total cost for educating a primary school student in Kabupaten Karawang takes 45% of a PEKKA member's annual per capita income
The average primary school distance in Karawang is 0.6 kilometer and many of the dependants go to school on foot
In Kabupaten Kubu Raya, the highest education cost when having dependants studying in primary school is, surprisingly, extracurricular activities
This incident occurs, probably, due to a number of dependants of PEKKA members who currently study in the sixth grade
For students in the sixth grade, the school usually gives them additional lessons after school hours and charges parents some fees
Other than additional lessons that the school has given, parents sometimes enrol their sixth grade children in a private course
By doing this, the parents hope that their children would be able to continue their study in a good junior high school
Nonetheless, PEKKA members have to spend 65% of their annual per capita income to educate one of their children in primary school
Most of primary school dependants in Kabupaten Kubu Raya also go to school on foot with an average distance of 0.6 kilometer
In Kabupaten Flores Timur, the highest cost for educating PEKKA members' dependants in primary school is for uniform and shoes
This would occur since residents in Flores Timur mostly import their needs from Java, so the price of goods such as uniform, shoes, and stationery are relatively high
The second highest cost is the expense for PEKKA members' dependants in primary school to buy daily snacks
However, educating one child in primary school would only take 18% of PEKKA members' annual per capita income
This is the lowest annual cost to educate one primary school student compared to the other study areas
This may be the case as the cost of the children's daily snacks is lower than in other study areas
The average distance to the primary school in Kabupaten Flores Timur is 0.6 kilometer
In Kabupaten Pidie, there is one PEKKA member's dependant who studies in junior high school and lives in a boarding house
The cost for the boarding house is quite high
It contributes more than 50% to the average total cost in education
Expenses to buy daily snacks are also high, followed by the cost of extracurricular activities
In total, PEKKA members in Kabupaten Pidie have to spend 364% of their annual per capita income to educate one child in junior high school
The average distance of junior high school in Kabupaten Pidie is 2.3 kilometers
Most of the dependants go to school on foot, while some ride a bicycle or use public transport, known as rbt
In Kabupaten Karawang, the highest education cost for a PEKKA member who has dependants studying in junior high school is the transportation cost
Most junior high school dependants in Kabupaten Karawang take public transport, while some walk to their school
The second highest cost is for the PEKKA members' dependants to buy snacks
Cost of extracurricular activities is also a significant expense for PEKKA member who enrol their dependants in junior high school
These high expenses in educating one junior high school student could take 113% of PEKKA members' annual per capita income
The average distance of junior high school is 1.7 kilometers
In Kabupaten Kubu Raya, the highest education cost is for PEKKA members' dependants to buy snacks, followed by the cost of extracurricular activities and the cost of transportation
Regarding those costs, PEKKA members in Kabupaten Kubu Raya have to spend 94% of their annual per capita income to send one child to junior high school
The average distance of junior high school in Kabupaten Kubu Raya is 1.9 kilometers
Most of the dependants ride a bicycle to their school
However, there are some PEKKA members' dependants who have to walk to school and continue their journey with a motorboat
These are children from Desa Mekarsari, the village where Sampit conflict refugees live
In Kabupaten Flores Timur, the highest education cost is for the boarding house
The second highest cost is extracurricular activities
Other significant costs that contribute to higher education expenses for PEKKA members' dependants are school fees, uniform and shoes, and expenses for their dependants to buy snacks, respectively
The average annual cost of educating one junior high school student in Kabupaten Flores Timur takes 64% of PEKKA members' annual per capita income
Most of the PEKKA members live near a junior high school and their dependants usually walk to school
However, there is one dependant who had to take a public transport, known as oto, and continue the journey to school with a public motorboat
The average distance of junior high school in Kabupaten Flores Timur is 1.5 kilometers
Since the exemption from school fees under the BOS program only applies for students in primary and junior high schools, in general, the costs for sending one child to senior high school are higher
In Kabupaten Pidie, the highest cost in education for senior high school dependants is for buying snacks, followed by extracurricular activities, and transportation costs respectively (Table 13)
The cost of a boarding house also contributes a significant expense for PEKKA members
As the table shows, the uniform and shoes cost is still higher than the school fees for dependants in senior high school
In total, PEKKA members have to spend 322% of their annual per capita income to educate one senior high school child
The average distance of senior high school is 3.3 kilometers
Most dependants go to school by taking public transport (rbt)
In Kabupaten Karawang, almost 50% of the average total cost in education for senior high school dependants is for the cost of buying daily snacks
The second highest cost is extracurricular activities and then transportation cost
The amount of money spent on school fees is higher than for uniform and shoes
The average annual total cost for educating a senior high school student in Kabupaten Karawang takes 170% of PEKKA members' annual per capita income
The transportation cost also has a significant contribution since most of the dependants go to school by taking a public transport or using a motorcycle
The average distance of senior high school for PEKKA member dependants is 3.7 kilometers
In Kabupaten Kubu Raya, the highest education cost is the transportation cost
This is due to the average distance to the senior high school of 6.3 kilometers
More than 50% of the dependants go to school by a vehicle, such as public transport, go on their parent's motorcycle, or bring their own motorcycle
The second highest cost is for extracurricular activities
School fees are also higher than the cost of uniform and shoes
The average annual total cost for educating a senior high school student in Kabupaten Kubu Raya takes 207% of PEKKA members' annual per capita income
In Kabupaten Flores Timur, the transportation cost for dependants in senior high school is considered to be the highest cost
It is followed by the cost for the boarding house, school fees, and the cost of uniform and shoes, respectively
The transportation cost is high due to the mode of transportation that dependants use
Most of them go by public transport, such as oto or ojek (motorcycle taxi)
The high cost of a boarding house occurs due to PEKKA members' enrolling their dependants in a good senior high school located on a different island
Regardless of the total cost in sending one child to senior high school which takes 103% of PEKKA members' annual per capita income, compared to other study areas, this total cost is relatively low
In summary, a) educating one primary school child at a state school takes 51% of a PEKKA member's annual per capita income, b) educating one junior high school child at a state school takes 140% of a PEKKA member's annual per capita income, and c) educating one senior high school child at a state school takes 178% of a PEKKA member's annual per capita income
These figures demonstrate that the total cost of educating a child at junior and senior high schools exceeds the average per capita income in a PEKKA household that would notionally be allocated to meet the day-to-day needs of that child
For children of female heads of household, the completion of the compulsory nine years of education is far from reality
MARRIAGE The Indonesian marriage law defines marriage as a physical and spiritual bond between a man and a woman as husband and wife with the purpose of forming a happy and eternal family and household based on God
The marriage is valid if it is conducted in accordance with the religious belief or faith of both parties involved
In Law No
23/2006, it is obligatory to report a marriage which is valid based on provisions outlined by laws and regulations no later than 60 (sixty) days after the date of marriage
It should also be recorded in the marriage certificate registry by an official at the population and civil registries agency
The marriage certificate book is given to the husband and wife
When seeking to register a marriage, Muslim couples register at the KUA at the kecamatan level and non-Muslim couples at the population and civil registries agency at the kabupaten level
The registration of a marriage also applies to marriages ruled by the court and marriages involving foreigners conducted in Indonesia based on their request
The registration of a marriage is also obligatory for Indonesian citizens who were married outside of Indonesia
The process of marriage registration at the KUA is as follows
The couple states their desire to marry by coming to the local KUA and submitting the following documents
(i) N1, N2, N3, N4, and N5 forms that have been validated by the village head or lurah;
(ii) a statement confirming that she or he is Muslim from a head of mosque or head of Majelis Taklim (a group that manages the activities of a mosque); 
(iii) for a spouse that has converted to Islam, a hand written statement stating the desire to convert to another religion and signed on a Rp6,000 authenticating stamp and acknowledged by the parents and village head;
(iv) copies of the identity card (KTP) or a letter stating the temporary substitution of the KTP from the village official;
(v) six blue 2 centimeters by 3 photographs; and 
(vi) the marriage examination list (DPN) signed by the couple and the guardian
If the bride- or groom-to-be is a member of the National Army of Indonesia (TNI), they are also required to have a letter of permission from their superior
The KUA priest will then examine the required documents and register the marriage on the DPN
The DPN has a ten-working-day policy for the whole process until the couple can marry
The KUA provides a lecture and course for the couple on forming a happy family
After ten days, the KUA conducts the marriage ceremony (akad nikah) and provides the marriage book
During the marriage ceremony, the KUA can also act as the representative of the guardian (act as the Muslim parents, but delegate the guardian position to the KUA priest) or act as the bride's guardian (for a non-Muslim women who coverts)
The process of marriage registration for non-Muslims is as follows
The couple submits a confirmation letter from a religious figure/priest stating that a marriage has taken place or a letter confirming that a marriage based on religion has taken place, signed by a religious figure/priest; 
husband's and wife's KTP; 
husband's and wife's photographs; and husband's and wife's birth certificates and passports for foreigners
After the requirements are met, the couple fill a form for marriage registration at the implementing office of the UPTD (regional technical implementing unit) by attaching all the requirements mentioned above
Then, the population and civil registries official at the UPTD will record it in the marriage certificate registry and issue a marriage certificate book
This certificate is given to both husband and wife
There is another type of marriage in the Muslim community, known as nikah siri
Nikah siri is a marriage between a man and a woman that is conducted based on Islamic law and having the same ijab kabul (pronouncement of marriage contract) by a male guardian of the bride in order to give consent to the woman's marriage, led by a Muslim priest (imam) or scholar (kiai), and attended by close friends and relatives of the bride and groom but not registered at the local KUA
However, nikah siri could be legalized through an isbat nikah process in the religious court
The religious court can provide Muslim parties with a document evidencing an earlier marriage
In 2009, over 13,000 marriage legalization (isbat nikah cases) were received by religious courts
The marriage legalization document obtained from the religious court can then be used at the population and civil registries agency to obtain other documents, including birth certificates
Law No
1/1974 on Marriage requires that the minimum age of marriage be 16 years old for women and 19 years old for men
Indonesian government policies aim to ensure that every child has the opportunity to complete nine years of basic education and to reduce women's illiteracy rate (Kementerian Negara Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional, 2007
37)
These policies support the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
The minimum age of marriage, which for girls is set at 16, is not considered compatible with these broader government development policies
Of the 601 PEKKA survey respondents, 161 (27%) were once married under the age of 16, which is below the legal age of marriage in Indonesia
The highest number of PEKKA members who did not marry is in Kabupaten Flores Timur (17 respondents)
As the marriage process is based on adat (local customs) in Kabupaten Flores Timur, and is expensive and complex, it is more likely that marriage at a young age will be rare
Some of the PEKKA survey respondents in Kabupaten Flores Timur are single, with 1–5 dependants, which is the reason they became PEKKA members
Most of PEKKA members across four study areas who married under the age of 16 were married at the age of 15
The youngest age of marriage was 9 years old
Since the minimum legal age of marriage for women is 16 years old, PEKKA members who married under the age of 16 usually did not have a marriage certificate
As shown in the table below, the 601 PEKKA women surveyed had a total of 782 marriages of which only 48% were legal marriages under the Indonesian law
The number of marriages is higher than the number of respondents because there are PEKKA members who were married more than once (Appendix Table A3)
The percentage of respondents who were married more than once is 22% (133 respondents)
The PEKKA members from Kabupaten Kubu Raya had a significantly high legal marriage rate of 71% despite having the highest percentage of its members living under the Indonesian poverty line
Kabupaten Flores Timur and Karawang had the lowest levels of legal marriage, with approximately one third of their members having a legal marriage
This variation in the percentage of PEKKA members with a legal marriage may be due to Kabupaten Kubu Raya's having the lowest average cost for obtaining a marriage certificate of Rp23,000 and Kabupaten Karawang's having the highest average cost for obtaining a marriage certificate of Rp86,000
On the other hand, the main reasons why PEKKA members across the four study areas do not obtain a legal marriage are that they
(i) are not aware of the importance of a legal marriage; (ii) do not know the procedures for obtaining the marriage certificate; (iii) think that it is the husband's responsibility to obtain the marriage certificate; and (iv) believe that marrying under religious law is already sufficient
In terms of religion, Kabupaten Pidie, Karawang, and Kubu Raya have a majority of Muslim PEKKA members, while Kabupaten Flores Timur has 46% Muslim and 54% non-Muslim PEKKA members
The religious characteristic affects the marriage process or mechanism in each kabupaten
In the case of Kabupaten Flores Timur, the adat also has an important role in affecting the marriage process
The next section will explain further the survey data related to the marriage of PEKKA members as well as custom or local factors that affect marriage in each kabupaten
3.1 Marriage in Kabupaten Pidie Twenty-nine percent of PEKKA members married for the first time at an age under 16 (Table 14)
There were respondents married for the first time at the ages of 10 and 11; 2 respondents at age of 13; 5 respondents at age of 14; and 38 respondents at age of 15 (Table 15)
There were even respondents who were married off before they had reached puberty
Being immature physically and psychologically, it is not surprising that many of these young women did not understand how to fulfill the marriage requirements set by the KUA
However, different information was obtained from the KUA head of the Kecamatan M who claimed that the average age of the first marriage in this region is 18 years and very few married underage
The authors assume that the different information can be attributed to two things
a) The first is time lag
The KUA head was only describing the recent situation, whereas we are aware that the majority of PEKKA respondents married more than ten years ago when adat and conventions differ from today
b) Secondly, the average marrying age of 18 may be correct for those who married at the KUA
However, in reality, many people, including PEKKA members, did not record their marriage at the KUA, so the real average age of marriage is not known
During the conflict, marriages in Pidie were conducted without being registered at the KUA and in 2005, the KUA issued a marriage book for those couples
For individuals who have not registered their marriage, they are required to verify their marriage (isbat nikah) in the Islamic Court in order to obtain their marriage book
For people who have lost their marriage book during the conflict or tsunami, the KUA will provide them with a duplicate of their marriage book
Of the 190 marriages, only 51% were registered legally in the KUA (all respondents were Muslim) with the couple having a marriage book as proof of their marriage
However, if respondents were asked about the procedures to obtain the marriage book, in general, they did not know the details
Based on Appendix Table A4, only 29% of respondents who have a marriage certificate knew how much they had to pay to get the book
For those who do not have a marriage certificate, it is because they did not understand the importance of a marriage certificate or because they considered these matters as their husband's or family's responsibility
In terms of frequency of marriage, there was one PEKKA survey respondent (1%) in Pidie, who did not marry
Eighty-six percent married once; 11% married twice, 2% married three times, and 1% of respondents married four times (see Appendix Table A3)
In the Pidie community, where most of the people are Muslims, marriage is generally conducted in line with Islamic practices or in accordance with state law
The cost for marriage is Rp30,000, plus a contribution for orphans in the amount of Rp20,000
Other expenses that the future bride and groom need to incur include a voluntary contribution to the imam for the marriage ceremony
The cost of getting married varies from Rp160,000 to Rp175,000
Many PEKKA respondents mentioned the high price of getting married at the KUA
In addition to paying a large cost for getting married at the KUA, there is a tradition in Aceh that obligates the future groom and his family to provide a bride price in the form of genuine gold, called mayam
The amount of this bride price is determined by the agreement between the groom and the bride's family
This bride price is usually about 10–20 mayam
On the one hand, the provision of this bride price is meant to ensure the woman's (bride's) dignity
However, on the other hand, the requirements of this bride price are sometimes considered too burdensome for the future groom and his family
3.2 Marriage in Kabupaten Karawang In contrast to the marriage law which sets the minimum marrying age for women at 16, in Karawang, 49% of the 115 respondents were married under the age of 16 (Table 14)
In fact, two respondents were married at the age of 9, one at the age of 11, and twelve at the age of 12
The high number of underage marriages is due to a dualism in the interpretation of the marriage law in a number of regions in Indonesia, including West Java (Karawang and Cianjur)
State law and religious law apply at the same time
According to Islamic law, a guardian of the bride, her parent, or a kiai can join a couple in marriage
This has lead to many couples marrying without registering at the KUA and thus they do not have a marriage certificate
Of the 236 marriages of respondents who are PEKKA members, only 34% have a legal marriage and marriage certificate
In terms of awareness of the cost of marriage certificate, for PEKKA members who have marriage certificate, there are 31% who did not know the cost of their marriage certificate (Appendix Table A4)
Reasons why PEKKA members in Kabupaten Karawang do not obtain a marriage certificate are that (i) they do not understand how to obtain it at the KUA; (ii) they do not see it as being important, so they did not bother to take the time to obtain one at the KUA; (iii) they cannot financially afford to pay for a marriage certificate, and (iv) they consider that marriage is their family's or husband's responsibility
The rate of marriage in Kabupaten Karawang is high with the majority of the 115 PEKKA respondents having married more than once
Of the 115 PEKKA members of Kabupaten Karawang who were surveyed, 40% married once, 33% married twice, 17% married three times, and 2% married seven times (see Appendix Table A3)
In general, the culture of the Karawang people is known to be very open
The high rates of marriage and divorce have existed for a long time and are linked to the community's openness to different cultures outside their region
These factors have led parents to quickly marry off their daughters during harvest, at a time where many fiestas are held by the community
Thus, there are many cases of daughters being married off at a very young age
Regarding marriage by state law mechanism, the various administrative requirements a couple must fulfill is confusing, especially for villagers
The PPN (marriage registry officials) or the amil, who is the kelurahan (urban village) or village official appointed by the village head to assist the KUA, is a person who often serves as an intermediary in helping couples complete all the required administrative papers
However, in practice, the cost of getting married is very expensive at between Rp350,000 and Rp500,000
According to the amil, that cost does not represent his services alone but includes the fee for a number of village staff and also the KUA official
The amil is said to only receive about Rp50,000
3.3 Marriage in Kabupaten Kubu Raya The percentage of PEKKA members in Kabupaten Kubu Raya married under the age of 16 is 32%
The youngest age of a PEKKA respondents' first marriage is 11 years old and the majority of respondents were married at the age of 15 (Table 14)
There are PEKKA members who were married under 16 but were able to obtain a marriage book
This is because their parents falsely reported their daughter's age
Parents usually ask a village office staff to change their daughter's date of birth which was written on the family identity card (KK or kartu keluarga)
Many such cases were found during interviews with several respondents
PEKKA members can accept cases like the above and they admit that they also marry their daughters off at a relatively young age
According to them, they can not refuse when a family proposes to marry their daughter because it is not polite to turn them down
They also think that it is better for their daughters to marry sooner while there is a man pursuing their daughter
Besides marrying them off will also reduce the family's economic burden
Table 16 shows that of the 155 PEKKA members in Kabupaten Kubu Raya, there were 195 marriages, including both first and subsequent marriages and marriages that were both recorded and that were not
The percentage of respondents who have a legal marriage and a marriage book is 71% of the total sample
In relation with these legal marriages, 61% of PEKKA respondents did not know the cost of obtaining a marriage book (Appendix Table A4)
The marriage book is important for a woman because it can be used as a legal document to claim her rights in the event of a divorce
One respondent who was divorced through the religious court said that she was lucky to have kept her and her husband's marriage book safely
When her husband decided to marry another woman without her consent, she was able to prevent her husband entering a polygamous second marriage because she had the legal documents to prove that she was his lawful wife (see Box 4)
For PEKKA members who do not have a marriage book (29%), the most common reasons are that they do not understand the issues surrounding the marriage book or because they consider obtaining the marriage book as their husband's or family's responsibility
Interviews with local community leaders revealed that the Madurese community is prepared to hold expensive wedding celebrations
However, they do not legalize the marriages at the KUA and obtain a marriage book
Not only is this because tradition requires them to prioritize the marriage ceremony, but also because the location of the relocated village makes it difficult to obtain legal married status
The village does not yet have a marriage registrar to represent the KUA
For people to officially record their marriage, they would have to travel about 25 km through rocky roads that can only be passed by motorcycles
An alternate route is to take a one and a half hour motorboat trip
Based on interviews with the RT head, there are only two family heads in the RT who have a marriage book, including himself
In terms of marriage frequency, most of surveyed PEKKA members (79%) are married once, 16% married twice, 4% married three times, and only one respondent (1%) married four times (see Appendix Table A3)
The cost of registering a marriage varies depending on the ability of the family to pay
However, different information was provided by officials of the local PPN
According to the PPN, marriage expenses can be high, especially for weddings conducted at the bride's house
The bride's family has to assume not only transportation costs, but also other fees
(i) document folders; (ii) a magazine on marriage published by the Department of Religious Affairs; (iii) Rp30,000 for the marriage book; (iv) a contribution to the PPN's savings account; and (v) a “special” payment to the KUA
Not one respondent knew the official rate for the marriage book, which is Rp30,000
In general, they were only told that the total cost would be more than Rp100,000
For some, the high cost of obtaining a marriage book is a problem
For future brides and grooms who are very poor, they can have these charges waived if they acquire a letter (SKTM) from the village head verifying their economic condition
However, at KUA Sungai Durian, there are no citizens who would want to bring an SKTM when getting married
A resource person affirmed that when he worked at the KUA of Kabupaten Bengkayang, there was a couple who was poor and was able to get married by submitting an SKTM
For non-Muslim couples, the cost of obtaining a marriage book can even be higher than that for Muslim couples
One informant revealed that she had to pay a fee of Rp400,000 for recording a marriage of a non-Muslim couple at the population and civil registries agency
Many non- Muslim citizens or those of Chinese descent only carry out their wedding in a church or Buddhist monastery, which is popularly known as nikah tamasya
The couple is given a marriage book issued by the church or Buddhist monastery, but this book is not recognized by the state and the marriage is considered nonlegal
It is recommended that after a marriage book is obtained from the church or Buddhist monastery, the couples register their marriage at the population and civil registries agency, which will then issue a marriage certificate as proof that the marriage is recognized by the state
However, most PEKKA respondents did not do this because the fee that is charged is high
3.4 Marriage in Kabupaten Flores Timur The average age of marriage for PEKKA members surveyed in Kabupaten Flores Timur is 20 years old
The age range of when they were first married is quite wide, between 14 and 39 years old
However, the majority (84%) married for the first time at the age of more than 16 years old and only 16% married under the age of 16 (Table 14), which include two respondents married at the age of 14 and seven married at the age of 15
Table 16 shows that there are 161 marriages of 167 surveyed PEKKA members in which 17 respondents are single or not married
Only 37% of these 161 marriages were legal with the PEKKA members receiving a marriage book
However, 19% of the respondents who were married legally and owned a marriage book were not aware of the cost of the marriage book (see Appendix Table A4)
Of the 161 PEKKA members' marriages, 63% were not legal and therefore they did not receive a marriage book
The reasons for the non-legal marriage include that they were married under adat law (50%), did not know the importance of having a marriage certificate (21%), or were not able to fulfill the administrative requirements (15%) (see Appendix Table A5)
The majority of respondents in Kabupaten Flores Timur have only married once (139 respondents or 83%)
Only a few respondents married twice (12 respondents or 6%), with seven of them married under religious or adat law because they were not the first wife
Regarding the marriage process, in Kabupaten Flores Timur, there are three types of marriage based on (i) adat conventions, (ii) religious law, and (iii) state law
A couple could marry under adat law in the first instance and then follow this with a religious law ceremony
Christian/Catholic couples often firstly marry under adat law and then follow this with a religious law ceremony, while Muslim couples first marry under religious law and then follow this with an adat law ceremony
A marriage based on adat starts with the couple getting to know each other and then agreeing to start a family
If their parents give their blessings, the families will meet at the house of the woman's parents
This meeting involves about 40 people from both sides to discuss the dowry (belis)
Only two to three people discuss the belis
The belis is presented in a form of a tusk and the number of belis presented is different for every case
The number of belis presented by ordinary people is between one and four and for the wealthy between five and seven
If both parties have reached an agreement about the belis, a pig and a goat will be slaughtered
When the blood of the pig and goat pours out, the couple's marriage is official according to adat and there is a bond between the man and woman
The next step is to hold a blessing at the church
A number of interesting cases of marriages based on adat have appeared, including where a man can marry as many women as he likes and the marriages are valid as long as he can pay his belis
Another case is where a couple holding different faiths can be officially married based on adat
In addition, the adat also regulates pregnancy out of wedlock and elopement
In Kabupaten Flores Timur, marriage based on religious law has been practiced for years
For Muslim couples, e.g., in Kecamatan Kelubagolit, marriage by Islamic law took place in the 70's and 80's
The couple was married off by their parents and an imam and kiai in a neighborhood mosque
However, since the operation of a KUA is at the kecamatan level, marriages are carried out by the local PPN at the bride's house and then recorded in the KUA
The Islamic marriages (nikah siri) are usually preceded by an elopement, where, in accordance with adat, a man who falls in love with a woman takes her to his family in the village or outside the village
After eloping, a representative of the man's family visits the woman's family one to three days later to deliver the news
After this notice, adat affairs will follow
To reconcile both families, the number of plala, which is a belis in the form of tusks, will be determined
Only if the man is able to present the tusks, the marriage will take place
If the man's family can not come up with the belis, they will have to make a statement at the adat forum where religious and adat figures meet on behalf of their clan
These negotiations can take months or even years
After they have reached an agreement about the time and adat provisions, the couple will first be married under Islamic law by an imam
If the imam understands the importance of the marriage book, he will suggest that the couple obtain it
There is no official cost for getting married by siri and it is determined through an agreement between the couple and the imam
For Muslim couples, when they want to register their marriage at the KUA, the couple must pay an amount of Rp30,000 to the government treasury for the marriage fee
In addition, the couple also pays Rp2,500 for administration matters/documents sent to the government treasury
If the couple ask the KUA to deliver the marriage fee to the government treasury, they will be charged Rp50,000 for the transportation fee within the kecamatan area
If the kecamatan area is large, it is difficult for the kecamatan KUA to reach areas that are far away
PPNs are usually assigned to areas like these
For example, in Kecamatan Kelubagolit, there are three PPNs, each in Sagu, Koli, and Adonara
The PPN's task is the same as the task of a KUA priest
After marrying a couple in the area, the PPN submits the N forms and DPN to the KUA
The fee for marriages conducted by the PPN is Rp100,000, which includes Rp70,000 for the PPN's transportation and Rp30,000 for the marriage fee
If a poor couple wish to marry, the KUA first clarifies matters with them
They are still charged the marriage fee of Rp30,000
In the N form, it is stated that although the couple have an SKTM from the village official, they are still charged with the same fee
However, they are freed from administration (Rp2,500) and transportation (Rp50.000) fees which become the KUA's responsibility
Up until the study was conducted, no SKTM were submitted to KUA Kelubagolit
Citizens of Kabupaten Flores Timur who are Christian/Catholic marry based on the Christian/Catholic religion
These marriages are under the authorization of the Bishop of Larantuka
Marriages of Christian/Catholic couples and of interfaith couples (a Catholic and a spouse with a different religion) are carried out in church
For Catholic couples, the church holds a preparation course for the couple which provides guidance for couples who will start a family, including for Catholic couples, different church marriages (Catholic and Protestant couples), and interfaith couples (a Catholic marrying a Muslim, Hindu, or Buddhist spouse)
The guidance period is between four and five days and for five hours each day
Collective guidance is conducted twice a year, with a number of 10 to 27 couples participating in each course
A guidance team from the church (parish) is present at the course
The content of the course includes marriage from the view of adat, civil law, and church regulation
The guidance team is made up of five couples
Expenses emerging from the course are paid collectively by the participants
After the guidance is completed, a canonical investigation is conducted and followed by a wedding ceremony
The canonical investigation of the couple is conducted by a pastor in the presence of their parents or guardian and two witnesses at the pastor's house (free of charge)
During this process, a statement is obtained by interviewing the couple about their willingness to marry
Their answers are noted by the pastor in a Canonical Sheet
Then, the pastor asks the couple, parents/guardian, and witnesses if one of the couple or both of them had married before
If the answer is yes, then the marriage is cancelled
If not, the marriage is official according to the church regulations
After the canonical process is completed, preparations for the wedding ceremony start where the Catholic couple receives a sacrament of repentance
However, for interfaith marriages, during the canonical investigation, the non-Catholic spouse and her or his parents must sign a written agreement that states that the spouse agrees to marry upon her or his free will and without any pressure
She or he has independently decided to marry (in the sense that each spouse is free to hold their own religion)
And another agreement is signed that states that the non-Catholic spouse agrees to baptize their children and raise them as a Catholic
However, if she or he decides to convert, a different process will be carried out where she or he will attend the guidance preparation
As for non-Muslim (Christian/Catholic) couples who have married under adat laws and then wish to be married by religious law, the church currently invites them to participate in the guidance sessions in order to register their marriage
Up until this research was carried out, 60 couples have obtained their marriage book through the church or church community
However, this type of marriage license is not legal according to state law
If the couples want to obtain a marriage book from the population and civil registries agency, they have to fulfill the following requirements
(i) a marriage license from a religious leader; (ii) two witnesses that fill in the required forms; and (iii) photographs of the bride and groom
The fee charged to produce the marriage certificate at the population and civil registries agency is Rp82,000
However, if the agency is implementing a free program where they tour around the villages, the future bride and groom from the village do not need to pay the fee for their marriage license
DIVORCE Law No
1/1974 regulates divorce between husband and wife
The law states that a marriage tie can be broken due to three reasons
death, divorce, or court decision
In the event of divorce, Muslim couples are required to bring their lawsuit to the religious court and non- Muslim couples to the general court
Law No
23/2006 on Population Administration also regulates divorce
If the divorce occurs outside Indonesian territory, it has to be reported at least 30 days after the divorced party returns to Indonesia
A divorce is legal only if it is decided by an Indonesian court and a divorce certificate is issued
In religious court terminology, if the divorce is initiated by the wife, it is known as cerai gugat and if by the husband, it is known as cerai talak
In divorce cases, general courts do not differentiate the case based on whether the applicant is the husband or wife
Twothirds of divorces in both religious and general courts are initiated by the wife
The number of divorces in the four study areas is shown in Table 17
Of the 601 respondents who are PEKKA members, there are 265 divorce cases and 38 of them (14%) were settled in courts
Twenty-five of the 38 cases (66%) were initiated by the PEKKA member
Of the 38 cases, 15 took place in Kabupaten Kubu Raya, 12 in Kabupaten Pidie, 10 in Kabupaten Karawang, and only 1 case in Kabupaten Flores Timur
This table also shows that in general the PEKKA member respondents of Kabupaten Karawang have the highest divorce rate
In contrast, in Kabupaten Flores Timur, PEKKA member respondents have the lowest divorce rate
For the poor, the main barriers to accessing the courts are financial and relate to court fees and transportation costs to travel to the nearest court
These problems are especially significant for the rural poor
Eighty-eight percent PEKKA members would be more motivated to go to court for their divorce cases if the court was able to waive the court fee and 89% PEKKA members would be more motivated to go to court for their divorce cases if the court heard their case in a circuit court
The cost of transportation to a court varies significantly depending upon whether a party lives in an urban environment close to the court or in a rural environment
Based on Sumner (2010a), 50% of court clients surveyed in 2007 and 2009 live within a radius of 10 km from the general or religious court that heard their divorce case
The 601 PEKKA women interviewed lived in both urban and rural areas
Urban PEKKA members lived on average 13 km from the court at a cost of Rp25,000 for a round trip to the court
However, rural PEKKA members lived on average 80 km from the court, at a typical cost of Rp92,000 for a round trip to the court (close to half the monthly per capita income of a PEKKA member)
The cost of a divorce case in the religious court (only court fee and the party's transportation costs) can therefore vary significantly, depending upon how far the party lives from the court
Divorce cases in general courts cost more, for there are on average three more court appearances per case
The further the parties to a divorce case live away from the court, the higher the transportation costs
In the Kabupaten Flores Timur case given above, for example, transportation costs contribute to as much as 70% of the cost of the case
4.1 Divorce Statistics in Kabupaten Pidie Religious courts in Aceh Province are known as mahkamah syariah (MS)
In relationships between husbands and wives in Aceh generally and in Kabupaten Pidie specifically, males traditionally say talak whenever it suits them
This means that husband/wife relationships can split up very easily, without going to the MS
According to husbands, this type of adat, unauthorized divorce, is in line with religious requirements though it is not legal according to state law
In Kabupaten Pidie, of the 164 PEKKA member respondents, there are 45 divorces
Only 27% of these divorces are legal and the wife initiated the divorce case in 75% of these cases
In terms of frequency, 21% of the 164 respondents have been divorced once and 2% have been divorced twice (see Appendix Table A7)
Only one respondent in Kabupaten Pidie had been divorced three times
The small number of divorces in Kabupaten Pidie is related to the community adat which means that it is easy for men to renounce their marriage by pronouncing talak and that is considered sufficient for a divorce according to religious regulations
Qualitative finding shows that there is a misunderstanding in relation to what a Muslim couple should do to acquire a divorce
Couples who have a disagreement and want to divorce often go to the KUA because they think the KUA can settle it
A divorce certificate cannot be issued by KUA
However, the KUA can help the couple try to resolve their disagreement through KUA's subdivision, known as BP4
If the disagreement cannot be dealt with at the KUA, then the KUA (in this case BP4) will call the geuchik to find out the truth of the matter
After this, the married couple is called by the KUA to make peace
If the peace-making process is not successful, the KUA recommends that they deal with their problem and legalize their separation at the MS
To date, the MS has dealt with more cerai gugat cases than cerai talak cases
Generally, reasons for cerai gugat are that husbands do not take responsibility or wives are neglected, while cerai talak are generally caused by a lack of harmony in the husband/wife relationship if they are constantly arguing
If the divorce is dealt with at the MS, it is compulsory for the judge to facilitate a mediation process
In Pidie, the MS has waived court fees for a long time
However, now there are some improvements with an increase in funds from the Budget Implementation Content List (DIPA) since 2007 (although there have not yet been any funds from DIPA to carry out socialization)
Thus, there needs to be cooperation with the syariah agency that is the particular agency in NAD because there may be a budget in the syariah agency and the agency could request judges from the MS to be involved in socialization
To obtain a waiver of court fees (prodeo), the applicant must bring an SKTM from the village head evidencing their poverty
4.2 Divorce Statistics in Kabupaten Karawang The marriage and divorce statistics in this kabupaten are quite high
This study affirms the statistics that among the 115 PEKKA members surveyed, there are 152 divorces (Table 17)
The significant number of divorce cases is probably related to the habit of early marriages (under 16 years old) and consumerism
Those who are too young to get married (mostly because their parents forced them) were usually unaware of the essence of marriage
A divorce usually occurs because the parents or the respondents wish to have a rich son-in-law/husband and they hope that the new marriage can improve the economic situation of the family
However, only 7% of existing divorces (ten cases) are legal with the couple receiving a divorce certificate
The PEKKA members surveyed who experienced a divorce do not feel the need to legalize their divorce as it requires money, time, and courage
Six of the ten legal divorce cases were initiated by the wife
The cases are mostly because of domestic violence, which is usually set off by the husband's extramarital affair or by the husband's inability to fulfill the family's needs
Divorce cases initiated by husbands were mostly because the wife works as a migrant worker in Saudi Arabia, which is common in Karawang
The women work abroad and trust their children with the grandparents, while the husband remarries
Divorce frequencies for the 115 respondents comprise 32% having been divorced once, 18% divorced twice, 11% divorced three times, 3% divorced four times, 2% divorced five times, 1% divorced six times, and 1% divorced seven times (see Appendix Table A7)
Only one respondent had two divorce certificates
One PEKKA member had two divorce experiences and stated that it took her more than five months to obtain her marriage certificate
She was not satisfied with the result because the court could not do anything when her ex-husband failed to fulfill his obligations
According to the verdict, her ex-husband was obliged to give Rp600,000 for the needs of her two children
Until now, he has given nothing
She spent Rp700,000 for the court fee and another Rp350,000 for transport and meals (she was accompanied by someone else during the process of the divorce)
An official at the religious court charged her another Rp1,000,000, but she did not have any more money
It is not easy for the villagers to understand the time and cost required to process a divorce case
However, not all divorce processes are costly
In Cianjur, the religious court collaborates with PEKKA to conduct circuit courts where the court fees are waived for the PEKKA members who can evidence their poverty
A PEKKA member who was a victim of domestic violence finally obtained her divorce certificate through this circuit court
Her case fee was waived by the religious court
It only took her two months to complete the process and Rp20,000 (for transport) to get the certificate
In Cianjur, the regional government (the labor office, police department, and law office) collaborates with the religious court and PEKKA to build people's awareness in civil administration such as getting certificates, reporting any acts of domestic violence, etc
The Bupati (Kabupaten Head) Decree of 2005 in Cianjur regulates the collaboration of the religious court, regional government, and PEKKA in the form of a Multi Stakeholder Forum (MSF)
In this forum, the religious court facilitates PEKKA's training program on law
The Cianjur Religious Court also conducts circuit courts to process marriage legalization and divorce cases at the kecamatan level
The service is made available due to the large number of domestic violence cases in the community
4.3 Divorce Statistics in Kabupaten Kubu Raya From the 155 respondents in Kubu Raya, 56 divorce cases are recorded (Table 17), but only 15 cases (27%) were brought before the court
Regarding the frequency of divorce, of the 155 respondents, 22% divorced once, 6% divorced twice, and 1% divorced three times
Most of the PEKKA members' divorce cases were not filed at the religious court in Mempawah, but in Kabupaten Sambas, Singkawang, and even in Java (because they had migrated from there)
Some lodged their cases in Kabupaten Pontianak since they were residing there (Box 3)
Of the 15 PEKKA members who had divorce cases, 9 people were the applicant or the one who initiated the case
Most of the respondents who filed for divorce claimed to know the cost, while the remainder did not know how much they had to pay
The other respondents did not have to pay for the case
A respondent of such a case stated that she was not charged any money because she was a recent convert
Her first husband left her to marry another woman
She then filed for a divorce at the Singkawang Religious Court
The official at the court sympathized because the Chinese woman was a recent convert and released her from any court fee
She remarried after that but had the same experience as her first marriage
Again, she filed for a divorce and this time accepted an amount of money because the religious court officials felt sorry for her
She then moved with her children to another village
Poor people can file for a divorce for free (prodeo case)
The nine divorce cases in the previous paragraph (see Table 17) occurred before prodeo cases existed, so none of them made use of the facility
According to a Mempawah Religious Court official, to have the court fee waived, the applicant has to submit an SKTM from his or her village head—acknowledged by the kecamatan head—along with a Jamkesmas or Raskin card
The bailiff who surveys the home of the plaintiff can also provide information for the judge on whether a person deserves to have the court fee waived
One of the respondents claimed to have difficulties while trying to obtain a prodeo case
To file her suit, she had to submit a letter applying for a divorce, in addition to the SKTM
The letter must include background information, such as chronological events that cause the divorce filing
She did not know how to make the letter, so a court official helped her
She was asked to pay Rp20,000 for the typing fee, but since she did not have any money, she begged the official not to charge her
In addition to the relatively high cost and the long process, the PEKKA members in Kabupaten Kubu Raya who want to file a divorce find it difficult to get to the location of the religious court
This is because Kabupaten Kubu Raya still depends on Kabupaten Pontianak for some public services, such as the religious and general courts, which are located in Kecamatan Mempawah
To facilitate people from other areas, the religious court has a representative office in the central kecamatan of Kabupaten Kubu Raya
The office is called Dewan Balai Sidang Pengadilan Agama Mempawah, which serves as a circuit court
The court had scheduled to conduct 30 trials in 2009
There are times when people cannot file for a trial at the representative office, especially if there are not enough officials to handle all the registrations
The distance between the religious court in Kecamatan Mempawah and the representative office in Kubu Raya is about 100 kilometers
People can travel by bus which takes three hours
Based on PEKKA members surveyed, the average distance of the religious court in Kecamatan Mempawah is 110.75 kilometers away and the average time to reach the place is 190 minutes
According to a qualitative interview, although the places are quite far away, respondents prefer to go back and forth instead of spending the night at Mempawah just to file for a divorce (unless they have relatives living there)
Besides, most of the respondents claimed that they had never been to Mempawah themselves, especially those who live in Desa Mekarsari and Kecamatan Rasau Jaya, so they just estimated the cost based on other people's experiences
For transport and meals, they usually have to spend about Rp82,809
4.4 Divorce Statistics in Kabupaten Flores Timur The villagers of Kabupaten Flores Timur hold on to their adat dearly
A marriage institution brings together not only the husband and wife but also both families—and even the tribes/clans
A woman becomes part of her husband's family once the belis is given
The marital bond cannot be broken by adat or religion
Most respondents stated that they do not expect to obtain a divorce
Nevertheless, there are a few divorce cases
The combination of difficulty in divorcing due to adat traditions (belis) and the high rate of migration, particularly for males, means that there are many female heads of households who become the breadwinner for their families
Some female heads of households still receive money from their husbands, but others receive no economic support
Of the 167 PEKKA members surveyed, there are only 12 divorce cases (Table 17)
The low rate of divorce shows that the people in this kabupaten are not in favor of divorcing
Only one of the twelve divorce cases (8%) was filed in a court and it was initiated by the wife
The reason why the other PEKKA members did not legally divorce in a court was because (i) the husband left without any warning, (ii) there was pressure from families or adat, (iii) the marriage was not approved by the husband's first wife, or (iv) the divorce was done under adat law
However, if a marriage is hard to continue, people will divorce anyway (see Box 5)
Based on divorce frequency for the 167 respondents, 93% have never been divorced, 6% have been divorced once, and 1% divorced twice (see Appendix Table A7)
In this kabupaten, no divorce case was settled in a prodeo or circuit court
Respondents have very limited knowledge (and access) regarding courts—religious or kabupaten
Most of them do not know the location of the courts, which are 38 to 65 kilometers away from their home
It takes about 1 hour 40 minutes to 8 hours for them to get to the courts, depending on the means of transportation
The cost of the transportation itself varies between Rp50,000 and Rp190,000
BIRTH CERTIFICATES Law No
23/2006 on Population Administration requires parents to obtain a birth certificate within 60 days of a child's birth
A population and civil registries agency will issue a birth certificate without charge to parents if they register their child's birth within 60 days
If the birth is not registered within one year from the child's date of birth, Law No
23/2006 requires a birth certificate statement to be obtained from a general court before the population and civil registries agency issues a birth certificate
Based on the time the birth is reported, there are three types of birth certificates
general birth certificates, special birth certificates, and dispensation birth certificates
General birth certificates are birth certificates generated based on reports of births given no later than 60 working days for Indonesian citizens and 10 working days for foreign citizens after the date of the birth
Special birth certificates are birth certificates generated based on reports of births which have passed the respective time limits for Indonesian citizens and foreigners
Dispensation birth certificates are birth certificates generated based on a government program that makes it easier to obtain a birth certificate for those whose births were reported late
Transition provisions were put in place by the Ministry of Home Affairs to delay the effect of certain provisions of Law No
23/2006 as they apply to birth registration until December 2010
In particular, the requirement of a general court decision in order to obtain a birth certificate will not enter into force until 2011
The transition provisions were required in order to provide time to raise awareness of the provisions of the new law
However, it had also become clear that this requirement would be a barrier to achieving the Government of Indonesia's Strategic Plan for Universal Birth Registration in Indonesia which aims for all births in Indonesia to be registered by 2011
In legal terms, to register a birth, five items are needed
(i) birth document from the doctor/midwife/child-birth assistant; (ii) name and identity of a witness to the birth; (iii) parents' KK; (iv) parents' KTP; and (v) the parents' marriage book/certificate
In reality, the fifth requirement is an obstacle for parents who want to register the birth of their children
However, the Law No
23/2006 on Population Administration provides for children to be issued with birth certificates even in cases where their parents do not have a marriage certificate
In these circumstances, only the mother's name is recorded on the birth certificate
Cultural norms in Indonesia, however, act as a strong disincentive to obtaining a birth certificate for a child unless both parents' names appear on the birth certificate
Across the four regions, there are 1,218 children of 601 PEKKA members surveyed and 56% of them did not have a birth certificate
The ownership of a marriage book is not the only obstacle for registering the birth of their children
Factors which lead to children not having birth certificates include lack of funds to pay for the arrangement of the certificate, great distance of the place to register births, or lack of understanding about the importance of a birth certificate
Whether a child is able to complete the compulsory nine years of education appears to be strongly linked to whether a child has a birth certificate
For the dependants aged 10–19 of PEKKA members surveyed in Kabupaten Karawang, Kubu Raya, and Flores Timur, 78% are still at school
Seventy percent of these dependants who are still at school have birth certificates
5.1 Birth Certificates in Kabupaten Pidie In Kabupaten Pidie, of the 422 children of PEKKA respondents, 87% do not have birth certificates (Table 19)
The most common reason for children not having birth certificates was that respondents did not understand their importance
Other reasons were that they could not afford the fee, the distance to the population and civil registries agency was too far from their home, they did not know the correct process that had to be undertaken, and they did not have a marriage book (see Appendix Table A8)
Documents needed to generate a birth certificate at the Kabupaten Pidie Population and Civil Registries Agency are a birth document, parents' marriage book, parents' KTP, and KK
If the parents do not have a marriage book, they must bring a letter from the head of the village explaining that the child is in fact from these two parents
This is because in Pidie, there are no regional laws or regulations about the implementation of Law No
23/2006 on Population Administration
To make services available to the community, the Kabupaten Pidie Population and Civil Registries Agency has two mobile population and civil registries registration unit (UP3SK) cars as facilities to provide key services to the community for getting KTP, KK, and birth certificates
These services are provided free of charge
The Kabupaten Pidie Population and Civil Registries Agency worked together with the camat and geuchik to announce to the community the schedule for when the UP3SK vehicles would visit the various kecamatan and villages
However, the socialization carried out by the camat and geuchik was not optimal, as indicated by the fact that when the UP3SK vehicle arrived at a village, there were no people there as they were all in the rice field or had other things to do
5.2 Birth Certificates in Kabupaten Karawang In Kabupaten Karawang, of the 214 children of PEKKA respondents, 42% do not have birth certificates (Table 19)
The common reasons for not having a birth certificate are that PEKKA members in Karawang do not have time to follow the process in making a birth certificate, they do not have a marriage certificate, and they do not have enough money (see Appendix Table A8)
In order to implement Law No
23/2006 on Population Administration, population and civil registries agencies have carried out a number of initiatives to influence community awareness about birth certificates
This has been done by approaching various institutions, such as labor agencies, immigration offices, education agencies, health agencies, and KUA
A birth certificate is required in the staff recruitment process and the migrant workers (TKITKW) process
When the schools began to require birth certificates for the primary school/junior high school level, parents begin to organize birth certificates for their children
It was stated that the KUA was increasingly active in making Muslim couples aware that a marriage document was one of administrative requirements for obtaining birth certificates for their children
The population and civil registries agency also stated that the number of non- Muslim couples who registered their marriage increased dramatically from only 50 couples in 2007 to approximately 400 couples registered in 2008
The regional government also made the organization process easier by allowing a marriage acknowledgement document to be used in place of a marriage book, which is one of the requirements for registering a birth certificate
As of August 2009, the regional government in Karawang had determined the marriage verification process at the village level
For marriages that took place before 1974, community members had to complete a Marriage Witness Certificate (SKKP), signed by two witnesses and the head of the village
However, there were some problems with this and so the time frame was extended to those who were married before 1980 so long as the kecamatan KUA was aware of the marriage
The SKKP form was available from the population and civil registries agency
So, arranging marriage documents for parents was processed at the village/kecamatan level
This mechanism had a significant impact on the increasing number of children with birth certificates
This point was evident in this research as ownership of birth certificates among the families of respondents was quite high
Since 2007, the population and civil registries agencies in Kabupaten Karawang and also in Cianjur have formed local birth certificate service teams
These teams provide certificate provision services directly to the community at the kecamatan level
This should take place every year; but, in fact, it depends on the availability of funds from the regional government
With these services, people who want to get a birth certificate do not need to go to the agency office in the kabupaten capital city
As well as providing these services, the team also carries out socialization for the community
This mobile service takes place after socialization
The community is usually informed a week before the service arrives so that they can prepare their administrative documents, such as KTP, KK, photocopies of marriage documents, or SKKP for those who do not have marriage documents
Community members are very enthusiastic to take advantage of the mobile service, to the point that in one day, there can be 600 (and sometimes up to 1,000) submissions requesting certificates
The government's objective in providing this mobile service is to increase community awareness about population administration and it has been very effective
However, the regional government is often lacking in funds, so it is not yet certain whether the service will continue
Village midwives or midwives practicing at the village/kecamatan level often help in the process of organizing a birth certificate
After assisting with a birth, the midwife will usually assist with organizing the birth certificate as a package for a cost of Rp500,000 to Rp700,000
However, one midwife stated that she only did this for those who had complete documentation, including marriage documents
For those who did not have marriage documents, the midwife would only provide a birth document
For poorer citizens, the regional government is currently planning regulations so that poor families will not be charged
However, these regulations are still being discussed at the central level, particularly in the Ministry of Finance
5.3 Birth Certificates in Kabupaten Kubu Raya In Kabupaten Kubu Raya, of the 276 children of PEKKA respondents, 45% do not have birth certificates (Table 19)
The common reasons for not having their children's birth certificate are because the surveyed PEKKA members did not know the importance of their children having birth certificates and they do not have money to obtain it (see Appendix Table A8)
Results from the survey indicate that there is an effort from the kabupaten government to raise people's awareness on obtaining birth certificate
One example is that now primary schools in Kubu Raya require their students to have a birth certificate
However, schools cannot force this requirement to be fulfilled as they have a quota of students which they must accept
The schools are worried that if they refuse to accept students without birth certificates, they will not have enough students
According to an information source from a junior high school in Kecamatan Rasau Jaya, birth certificates only have an important role at the primary school level because the name of the students on the birth certificate is the name that will be used on their primary school diplomas
Thus, only when it is time for the national exams do primary school staff request birth certificates from each student
Junior high school diplomas only need a primary school diploma with the National Student Number attached
This name and number are then used for the student's further education diplomas
Some schools also assisted with the process of obtaining birth certificates as their students were taking part in competitions to represent the school
PEKKA has also made a program to obtain birth certificates for the children of their members
The program took place for the first time in March and April 2008
The cost to organize a birth certificate was Rp21,000 per child
After this program no longer existed in formal terms, some PEKKA members were still asked for help informally to assist PEKKA members and other community members who had not yet organized birth certificates for their children
The cost was different
Rp25,000 for children under 17 years of age and Rp45,000 for children over 17 years of age
Aside from that, many people in Kubu Raya now try to obtain work opportunities overseas which lead them to obtaining a birth certificate as the immigration office requires birth certificates when issuing passports
These community members were able to get birth certificates commonly through the labor agents
Either they organize the birth certificate at the population and civil registries agency or they will use someone else's birth certificate—so, some migrant workers left the country using another person's name
Regarding Law No
23/2006, Kabupaten Kubu Raya issued Bupati Regulation No
21/2008 on Birth Certificate Registration Services Dispensation
This regulation was effective for one year after its issuance, to 31 March 2009
One program related to this regulation is an exemption from fees
This program had been conducted by all kecamatan in Kabupaten Kubu Raya since April 2008
However, this exemption from fees program applies only if a person takes his/her family member's birth certificate to the kecamatan themselves
Some village officials initiated a collective assistance which requires a service fee
At the time of research in Kabupaten Kubu Raya, there were no regional regulations concerning population and civil registries administration sector fees; they were still using the regulations from the main kabupaten, that is, Kabupaten Pontianak Regional Regulation No
4/2006 on Changes to Kabupaten Pontianak Regional Regulation No
3/2001 on Population and Civil Registries for Certificates Administration Sector Fees
This regional regulation decreed that Indonesian citizens aged 0–18 years could organize a birth certificate free of charge
Indonesian citizens over 18 years of age who were the first or second child had to pay Rp10,000, while if they were the third child onward, they had to pay Rp15,000
However, in practice, the fee to make a birth certificate for Indonesian citizens over 17 years of age was officially Rp17,000, but those making submissions were asked for Rp25,000
The official payment for Indonesian citizens aged 1–17 was Rp2,500, but they were asked for Rp5,000
For Indonesian citizens less than one year old, there was no fee
Many PEKKA members do not want to organize the birth certificate themselves because they are worried that they will have problems at the population and civil registries agency and will have to go back and forth to the agency many times, meaning an increased amount of money spent on transportation
Based on conditions in the field, the Kabupaten Kubu Raya community's awareness of owning or arranging letters related to family law and civil status is still very low
This condition is influenced by the access to local government services before the formation of Kabupaten Kubu Raya when the community had to travel approximately 80 kilometers to arrange birth certificates
Conditions one year after the formation of the new kabupaten had not changed much, given that socialization about the formation of the new kabupaten and the community's access to local government services were not known by the surrounding community
Some respondents did not know that the Kubu Raya Population and Civil Registries Agency was separate from the population and civil registries agency in Mempawah and was located in the Kubu Raya bupati's office in Kecamatan Sungai Raya
5.4 Birth Certificates in Kabupaten Flores Timur In Kabupaten Flores Timur, of the 306 children of PEKKA respondents, 34% do not have birth certificates (Table 19)
The reasons why children of PEKKA respondents did not have birth certificates included (i) the parents stating that they did not understand why a birth certificate was important for their children; (ii) they not knowing how to arrange a birth certificate; (iii) they not having a marriage book; (iv) they not having the funds to pay to organize the birth certificate; (v) and/or the local population and civil registries agency being far from their place of residence (see Appendix Table A8)
As a result of not having a birth certificate, there are difficulties in enrolling these children in school and when they want to enrol their children, parents have to make an explanation document
Another problem is that these children cannot make a passport
In obtaining a birth certificate of their children, PEKKA respondents generally received assistance from the village apparatus, a family member, a PEKKA member, or the school their children attended
The cost of arranging the birth certificates ranged from Rp1,000 to Rp50,000
Some respondents stated that they did not pay anything when organizing birth certificates for their children
The type of marriage a couple undertakes, whether according to adat, religious, or state law, also has implications for the birth certificate of any children the couple have
Children of parents who had a Catholic marriage receive a baptism document
This document is the right of every child who has been baptized
However, if such a child needs to obtain a birth certificate from the population and civil registries agency in Larantuka, the requirements needed are evidence of the baptism or birth documents and a photocopy of the parents' marriage document from the church (Larantuka Diocese)
Children of parents who married according to state law have their birth certificates organized at the population and civil registries agency
The requirements to do so are a birth document and a marriage document or marriage certificate issued by the population and civil registries agency
If the parents do not have a marriage document, they can use a marriage document from the mosque's imam or a letter of blessing from the church
If there is no marriage certificate and no marriage document from the imam or letter of blessing from the church, the birth certificate only includes the mother's name, not the father's name
Children born outside of wedlock also have only the mother's name written on the birth certificate
There is no specific way to organize birth certificates for poor members of society, whether using a letter stating that they are poor (SKTM) or not
However, the population and civil registries agency provides a free service program which is not limited only to poor people but is actually for the whole community in the free service program region
KEY FINDINGS AND STRATEGIC RESPONSES This chapter summarizes the key findings and strategic response of the access and equity study and have been drafted collaboratively by the Poverty and Legal Access Survey research team
The strategic response section is colour-coded to show those strategic actions that
are achievable, have high impact, and can realistically be undertaken in the short-term (in dark grey) and will require PEKKA to engage in advocacy with one or more agencies and may take longer to achieve (in light grey)
The strategic responses are based on findings and divided into two categories, short-term and medium-term strategic actions
SMERU is an independent institution for research and policy studies which professionally and proactively provides accurate and timely information as well as objective analysis on various socioeconomic and poverty issues considered most urgent and relevant for the people of Indonesia
With the challenges facing Indonesian society in poverty reduction, social protection, improvement in social sector, development in democratization processes, and the implementation of decentralization and regional autonomy, there continues to be a pressing need for independent studies of the kind that SMERU has been providing
A creation of an Indonesian society free of absolute poverty and high inequality through research aimed at evidence-based poverty and inequality reduction strategies, policies, and actions
Carrying out research on poverty-related issues for the purposes of improving public policies and their implementation
Conducting effective outreach to national and regional governments, civil society, academics, and the international community
Supporting inclusive public policy discourse on poverty and inequality reduction strategies
Strengthening the role of civil society in the formulation and implementation of public policies
In its tenth year, The SMERU Research Institute has secured a leading position as an institution of public policy studies in the socioeconomic field, especially poverty issues
Various success stories such as this remind me of the saying “maintaining success is more difficult than achieving it in the first place”
We should be grateful to God for SMERU's success being achieved alongside the growth of the organization's culture which consists of at least four elements
First is hard work and perseverance, shown by the attitude to always perform tasks earnestly, not perfunctorily
Second is being independent and objective, which in the research world and tradition best reads “what is found is what is reported”
Third is being honest and conforming to stated rules, which is realized by not taking advantage of loopholes in rules and loose supervision (internal) and by complying with laws and regulations (external), such as those on tax, financial audit, insurance, organizational registration, and research permit
Fourth is participatory management and openness
Participatory management is demonstrated through the attitudes of the leaders who always involve staff in making decisions on important issues of the organization
SMERU's openness is applicable to the public, allowing them to freely access both its research reports and those of its administrative activities
Quality research and continued efforts to develop the culture of the organization often require expensive costs
To date, SMERU's sources of funds outside the core funding, namely project funds and competitive research grants, continue to increase
Both are even close to half its revenue
However, SMERU still needs philanthropic support of core funding to preserve its independence and establish control over its research agenda
SMERU's financial condition is still “not yet safe” to assure its sustainable life
Nevertheless, the institute will never accept funds from any party who, in channeling or offering research grants, adopts practices that violate existing rules
In 2010, SMERU received core funding from the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID)
Such philanthropic funds for socioeconomic research activities are still difficult to obtain from domestic sources
Besides the core funding, SMERU also received project funding from the World Bank, Institute of Development Studies (IDS, Sussex University), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Allianz Insurance, Black Health Economics, Overseas Development Institute (ODI), and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), as well as competitive grants from the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) and from the European Union
Today, Indonesia is still facing many big and complex socioeconomic problems
Settlements to these problems require a thorough and long-term planning
In order for any effort to improve the livelihood of the people, especially the poor, to be accurately targeted and effective, its policy formulation and implementation plan need the support of various research results
In this regard, SMERU's research works have had influence on—and will continue to influence—a wide range of public policies to improve the people's welfare
Thus far, SMERU has been able to carry out this mandate thanks to the availability of funds from various sources, especially AusAID, as well as the full dedication of its management, researchers, and supporting staff
For that, on behalf of the Board of Trustees of The SMERU Foundation, I would like to express my highest appreciation
The year 2010 marked a new era in SMERU's life
Early this year we finalized the process of purchasing our own building
The property is located at Jl
Cikini Raya No
10A, Central Jakarta
After several months of renovation works, the building was ready by the middle of the year
The process of moving to the new office was accomplished within two weeks in July
However, it took several more weeks for the staff to adjust to the new office until things resumed their normal courses
Indeed, the whole process had been tiring yet exciting for the staff
Having our own office building had been our ideal since the very beginning
It took ten years of hard work to realize it
In the first ten years of SMERU's life, we rented large houses for our office
And we had started looking for a permanent office space since 2007, as we thought it was time for SMERU to be more established physically
But it was the letter from the Kota (City of) Jakarta Pusat Government around the end of 2009 that really pushed us to search more seriously for a building for sale
The letter requested us to move from our then office building, as it was located in a residential area
We finally settled on our current office, as we thought it had the right size for us and was located in a commercial area with easy access to our stakeholders
During the whole busy and sometimes complicated process of searching, purchasing, renovating, moving, and adjusting to the new office, SMERU staff managed to continue producing high quality research
As recorded in SMERU's biannual reports and verified in Project Consultation Committee (PCC) meetings during this period, the quantity and quality of SMERU's outputs continued to increase
All SMERU staff have always realized that the future of SMERU as an independent research institution is much more dependent on its ability to continue producing high quality research than on owning an office building
In terms of funding diversification, two important developments in 2010 need to be highlighted
The first is a reengagement between SMERU and Ford Foundation
For seven years since the establishment of The SMERU Research Institute in 2001, Ford Foundation had provided core funding for SMERU
After a vacuum for three years
In 2010 the then new Ford Foundation Representative in Indonesia, David Hulse, visited SMERU and conveyed his intention to resume the partnership between Ford Foundation and SMERU
As a first concrete action of this partnership, Ford Foundation will provide a grant for SMERU in 2011 to conduct a study on urban poverty in Indonesia
The second welcomed development is the forming of a partnership between SMERU and UNICEF
It covers a broad range of activities, from research on child poverty, organizing a conference on research on children issues, forming a network of research institutes working on children issues, to capacity building for UNICEF staff
Both developments indicate the trust international organizations have on the quality of SMERU's work
In SMERU's effort to influence policy, 2010 also witnessed a new benchmark
In 2010, SMERU's senior research fellow and former director, Sudarno Sumarto, was appointed policy advisor at the National Team for Accelerating Poverty Reduction (TNP2K) at the Vice President Office
This is a form of collaboration between researchers and policymakers in the policymaking process, which is considered very effective in feeding research findings into policy
At the same time, this is a recognition of SMERU's research quality by the policymakers
All of these achievements are made possible only by a combination of hard work by SMERU staff and strong supports from our stakeholders
Therefore, I would like to extend my gratitude to SMERU staff, SMERU Boards of Trustees and Supervisors, and our donors and partners for their unrelenting hard work and continuous supports to SMERU
In particular, I would like to thank AusAID for their continuing core-funding support to SMERU since its establishment
Finally, I hope this annual report will inform our stakeholders and the public of our outputs and achievements during the year 2010 and provide evidence that the supports given were indeed used effectively for the common good
In 2007, the Government of Indonesia initiated a pilot of a conditional cash transfer (CCT), namely the Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH), to complement various ongoing supply-side assistance measures for health and education
The PKH is the government's first social protection program that specifically requires the mother, or a woman in the household, to be the transfer recipient
This SMERU study, which is funded by the Social Protection in Asia (SPA) Program, aims to assess the impact of a direct transfer of funds to women's position, intra-household welfare dynamics, and program outputs, in terms of general family welfare
The fieldwork was conducted in two urban villages and two rural villages in February, April, and May 2009
The study concludes that there should be more effort to mainstream gender at the local levels, as they lack awareness on gender mainstreaming
In addition, the external monitoring system of the PKH needs to be simplified and made more manageable as well as less burdensome for schools and health service providers
From May 2009 to January 2012, SMERU is conducting a study on gender and social protection effectiveness, especially in relation to the issue of food insecurity
The study is a three-year joint research project between SMERU and Overseas Development Institute (ODI), UK
Funding for the study was awarded from the 2008 Funding Round of the Australian Development Research Awards (ADRAs) by AusAID
The study aims to find out how policy and program design can better address specific social vulnerabilities and risks related to gender and life cycle to improve the effectiveness of social protection programming and types of social protection instruments which are effective for this purpose in different political-institutional and sociocultural contexts
The fieldwork was conducted from October to November 2009 in two kabupaten (districts)
In general, the study finds that gender aspect has not been deeply incorporated into the design of social protection programs in Indonesia
Specifically, the case study on Rice for the Poor (Raskin) Program uncovered the fact that women in general and female household heads in particular did not enjoy special treatment or priority
There is, however, no gender bias in terms of the receipt of Raskin benefits within the recipient's household
Funded by AusAID during 2007–2009, this study was part of a research collaboration led by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Indonesia with assistance from the Family Court of Australia and the Indonesia Australia Legal Development Facility (IALDF)
This study investigated various barriers faced by female heads of households, who are members of PEKKA, when they bring family legal cases to the court as a way of assessing barriers that are generally faced by women and the poor
Besides collecting quantitative data on PEKKA members, this study also investigated reasons why Indonesian women and their children must have legal marriage, divorce, and birth certificates and why the documents are important for the female heads of households and their children in order to access public services implemented by the government
This study finds that (i) more than half of the respondents of this study live below the Indonesian poverty line; (ii) one-third of the PEKKA members living below the poverty line cannot access the government's poverty reduction programs; (iii) respondents' ability to get marriage and divorce certificates is very limited, and this affects their access to birth certificates for their children; and (iv) achievement levels in education of the respondents and their children are lower than the national figure
Poverty reduction has become a major policy initiative in Indonesia since the beginning of the 1997/98 economic crisis
To cope with the social impact of the crisis, including an increase in poverty, the government then established a social safety net program, called Jaring Pengaman Sosial (JPS)
It was the initial undertaking of various poverty reduction and social protection programs implemented by successive governments in the post-crisis period
The government's poverty reduction strategy is currently formulated through a clustering of poverty reduction programs based on their objectives and targets into (i) social assistance—to provide direct assistance to poor households to ease their burdens in meeting basic necessities; (ii) community empowerment—to provide poor communities with social funds to improve basic social and economic services according to their own priorities; and (iii) microenterprise empowerment—to provide access to credits for microenterprises without collaterals
Evaluation of these programs' effectiveness in achieving their objectives has shown mixed results
We propose three areas of reforms to enhance human and financial capital accumulation of the poor to move out of poverty and simultaneously safeguard the near poor from falling into poverty
(i) institutional capacity in managing poverty and vulnerability reduction; (ii) quality improvement of poverty database and targeting mechanism; and (iii) better integration of the three clusters of programs
In 2005, the Government of Indonesia introduced the Askeskin program, a subsidized social health insurance for the poor and the informal sector
This insurance scheme covers basic healthcare in public healthcare centers and inpatient care in thirdclass hospital wards
The study investigates the implications of the Askeskin program for access to healthcare and associated financial risk for the poor
The analysis of the study is based on a household panel (Susenas) of 8,582 households conducted in 2005 and 2006
The first wave of the survey was conducted just before the start of the Askeskin program, hence the provision of a baseline
The study finds that the program is indeed targeted to the poor and those most vulnerable to catastrophic out-of-pocket health payments
Despite some nontrivial leakage to the nonpoor
The Askeskin program has improved access to healthcare, as the utilization of public outpatient care increases
In addition, the study does not find evidence of substitution effects from private to public care
While there does seem to be a positive increasing impact on out-of-pocket payments in urban areas
To improve the Askeskin program, it is important that the government take into account possible responses from healthcare providers and provide them with adequate payments to avoid a backlash in the provision of public healthcare
To continue facilitating cooperations among nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), in 2010, SMERU's NGO Partnership Officer (NPO) had attended 18 seminars/workshops/ meetings in Jakarta and Bandung, organized either by the Ministry of Agriculture or NGOs
For the same purpose, this year, the NPO has expanded SMERU's NGO database to 2,773 entries
The database is very popular as reflected in the 47,388 visits to SMERU's website from January to December 2010
The NPO actively participated in three SMERU studies this year
In the Monitoring of the Global Financial Crisis Impact study, she was the project administrator, while in the Gender Equality Assessment study, she listed and contacted NGOs working on gender issues
During the Child Poverty and Disparity study, together with several SMERU researchers, she organized an FGD with around 20 NGOs to discuss the study plan and explore issues related to child poverty
The NPO also arranged for a SMERU researcher to facilitate a training session on research methodology for WALHI, focusing on Participatory Action Research on the Corruption in the Mining Sector in Indonesia
Furthermore, she arranged a meeting between SMERU and the International Women and Family Foundation from South Korea which discussed gender issues
The meeting also discussed the birth certificates in Indonesia and the multicultural marriages among South Korean farmers
The highlight of SMERU's networking in 2010, aside from its engagements with government agencies, donors, and academics, was its active involvement with the Evidencebased Policy in Development Network (EBPDN)
This network facilitates capacity strengthening of its CSO members (mostly NGOs) in evidence-based policy advocacy
Another year had passed and the year 2010 had been a year of productive moments for SMERU's Publications and Information Division, marked by several important activities that it had undertaken
The division's staff started the year by improving the division's planning system, followed by an improvement of its editorial procedure in February
These were done in order to assure that tasks were managed well and would result in quality and timely publications
On 28 January 2010, a SMERU editor shared on how to use WordFast
Knowing how to use WordFast would help SMERU translators translate faster and, therefore, increase productivity
The division had published various publications comprising four research reports, two working papers, one field report, one newsletter, one policy brief, and one book
The division had also published two CDs, containing a compilation of SMERU's publications from 2001 to 2009 and research papers presented in a UNICEF conference about Research on Child Issues, jointly organized by UNICEF, Bappenas, and SMERU on 22 November 2010
Since August 2010, the division's staff had been involved in the organizing committee of the conference
With hard work and good coordination with the UNICEF and Bappenas counterparts, the staff could help bring success to the conference
With the recruitment of four new researchers in 2010 came the need to introduce SMERU's writing style guide so that they would adjust their writing style according to SMERU's and can avoid unnecessary revisions during editing processes
The briefing itself was held on 13 October 2010
Every year, the SMERU library tries to improve its performance in providing and managing data and information for all SMERU staff in an efficient way
This is in line with SMERU's position as an independent institution whose role, among others, is to provide accurate and timely information as well as objective analyses in each of its research reports
The search for as well as the management and dissemination of information related to the research field remain the priorities of the library
This fact makes the librarian a valuable partner for SMERU researchers
Often enough, she is involved in research activities to help check documents and provide literature
Until the end of 2010, the SMERU library had added to its collection 434 new titles of books and articles
Currently, its collection has reached a total of 5,039
One of SMERU's missions is to distribute results of its research to the central and regional governments, civil society, international community, and academics
In the second week of August 2010, an Indonesian student, who was pursuing her study at Tsukuba University, Japan, visited the library to search for data for her thesis
Book discussions have continuously been held as internal learning activities
In January, the first book discussed was Hermeneutics and Human Science with Muhammad Syukri as the reviewer
Then, the same event in July discussed Angela's Ashes with Rizki Fillaili as the reviewer
The SMERU library's plan for future work is to develop a network with libraries of other research institutes that study poverty reduction, policy reforms, or other issues related to poverty reduction
This collaboration will be pursued by developing a joint catalog that will compile data on collections from those libraries into one internet portal
It is hoped that such portal will become a source of information for those interested in studying poverty issues
The SMERU website is periodically updated to provide room for new publications as well as the latest information about SMERU's activities
The number of visits to the SMERU website throughout 2010 was 299,275 hits, almost 2.5 times higher than the previous year's figure, or only slightly lower than the figure in 2008
A total of 204.86 gigabytes of data, more than any of the previous years' amount of data, was downloaded
During the second semester of 2009, there was a decline in the number of visits, which was presumably caused by a technical problem with the web server
Most of the SMERU website's visitors identified were from Indonesia (71.86%), the United States (11.17%), Ivory Coast (2.05%), Australia (1.75%), and Malaysia (1.30%)
As many as 20 reports were uploaded to the website in 2010 and, in total, they had been downloaded 101,875 times
Thank for SMERU
I've got a lot of information from your researchs and they'we very useful for my study
I've interested with fiscal decentralisation
I hope your researchs could help Goverment to improve its policy
In addition to the publication updating process, website development had also been conducted, particularly for the support system
Besides simplifying the content updating process, the content management system that was developed recorded every change made to the content

During these activities, SMERU staff actively participated in discussions on various issues and shared SMERU's research findings
The Board of Trustees and Project Consultation Committee (PCC) meetings were held on 27 and 28 July 2010
The purpose of these meetings was to report SMERU's progress and achievements in 2010
The Board monitors and evaluates SMERU's operation
Thus, during such meetings, they give feedback, recommendations, and advice to further improve the conduct of SMERU's activities
These meetings were attended by donor agencies, potential donor agencies, government officials, NGOs, SMERU founders, members of SMERU Board of Governors and Board of Advisors, and SMERU management as well as senior staff members
In 2010, SMERU recruited five new researchers
Meanwhile, three researchers successfully got scholarships for continuing their studies
In addition, with SMERU's support, one researcher has participated in a diploma course on International Health and Policy Evaluation (IHPE) held by Institute of Social Studies (ISS) and Erasmus University in Netherlands
SMERU also nominated one researcher to continue her study for a master's degree in public policy at the University of Indonesia
Early in January 2011, all staff were required to take part in an annual staff performance assessment
The evaluation was completed in three ways
peer review, director's review, and self-review
The latter has only been implemented this year to complement the other two
Significant efforts are implemented to develop physical resources in order to support the Institute in terms of adequate office space, library collection, and information technology development
In the middle of 2010, with its Board of Trustees' approval, SMERU had been able to procure an office building
Teachers are the determining factor in whether the implementation of education is successful
Research has shown that teachers make the biggest contribution to student achievements
In the midst of limited school facilities and infrastructure, especially in remote areas, the teacher's role is even more important
However, various research studies show that the teacher absentee level in remote areas in developing countries is still quite high
This occurs because teachers in remote areas have to deal with many complex problems, including limited facilities within the school, difficulties in accessing the school because of the terrain surrounding the school, lack of transportation facilities, and high cost of transportation
The disproportionate size of the problems faced by teachers, in comparison with the incentives they receive, can lead to teachers being demotivated and can decrease the performance of teachers in carrying out their jobs
Thus, it is very important that a satisfactory incentive is given to teachers in remote areas so that education in remote areas does not continue to be left behind in comparison with more developed areas
Remote Area Allowance Program In many cases, giving economic incentives to teachers can increase teacher attendance levels at schools
The distribution of an incentive can also increase student achievement, especially through improvements in teaching methods, extra lessons outside regular teaching hours, and improving teachers' responses to student needs
In Indonesia, the distribution of an incentive to teachers working in remote areas was regulated under Law No
14/2005 on Teachers and Lecturers
This law was elaborated in National Education Minister Regulation No
32/2007 on Allowances for Teachers in Remote Areas, which states that civil servant and non-civil servant teachers who have fulfilled the set requirements will receive the remote area allowance
Teachers participating in the Remote Area Allowance program received an incentive of Rp1,350,000 per month
It was hoped that the distribution of the remote area allowance would motivate teachers to continue teaching in the remote areas in which they were already working
To investigate the effectiveness of the Remote Area Allowance program, The SMERU Research Institute carried our research on the impact of the remote area allowance on one main indicator of teacher performance; teacher absentee levels in schools
With this, the effectiveness of the program can be examined and, if the program should be continued, what improvements will be needed
Findings The results of the 2008 survey show that, on average, the absentee level for RA teachers in RA public primary schools (31.5%) is far higher than the absentee level for non-RA teachers (25.4%)
The absentee level for RA teachers in RA public primary schools is also much higher than that for teachers in non-RA public primary schools (24.4%)
On average, the teacher absentee level for all RA schools is still higher than that for non-RA schools (see Table 1)
kjgddghvjhdg In general, the survey results for five RA kabupaten show that the Remote Area Allowance program has not yet had a positive impact on teacher absentee levels in schools in remote areas
However, the survey results also show variations in the effectiveness of the Remote Area Allowance program in the RA sample regions
The Remote Area Allowance program's effectiveness can be seen in Kabupaten Sukabumi and Kabupaten Lahat, but not in Kabupaten Lombok Tengah and Kabupaten Kolaka
Whether the program has been effective in Kabupaten Nunukan cannot yet be identified because when the survey was conducted, the program had not been implemented
In Kabupaten Lahat, the absentee level for RA teachers (25.6%) is lower than that for non-RA teachers in RA schools (30.8%), although this is far higher than the absentee level for teachers in non-RA schools (12.7%)
This indicates the positive impact of the Remote Area Allowance program in RA schools in this kabupaten
In Kabupaten Sukabumi, the absentee level for RA teachers and non-RA teachers in RA schools is almost the same (12.5% and 12.0% respectively) and is slightly lower than the teacher absentee level in non-RA schools (13.3%)
This low teacher absentee level for RA teachers in Sukabumi is due to the fact that the regional government implemented a policy that was very conducive with increasing teacher welfare, which is to distribute an incentive similar to the remote area allowance as part of the Kabupaten Sukabumi Regional Government policy, as regulated in Bupati1 Regulation No
26A/2007
SMERU's survey also shows that the teacher absentee level influences student achievement
The higher the teacher absentee level, the higher the student absentee level, and the lower the proportion of students that obtain high test scores in tests carried out by schools (see Figure 1)
On the contrary, the lower the teacher absentee level in an area, the higher the test scores achieved by the students
Recommendations The implementation of the Remote Area Allowance program has had a different impact on the absentee level of teachers in remote areas in each RA region
The effectiveness of the Remote Area Allowance program in increasing the teacher attendance level in two sample regions shows the importance of the regional government's role in this program
Communication and coordination between the central government, the provincial government, and the kabupaten level regional government in the implementation of the Remote Area Allowance program must be supported proactively by the kabupaten regional government, which is the main authority in the matter of managing basic education and has a better understanding of the conditions and needs of the regions
A good first step in doing this can be regional government initiatives formulating various regional policies related to teacher welfare, for example, complementing the implementation of the Remote Area Allowance program with a similar program
Besides that, the willingness of the regional government to allocate funds to give a (supplementary) local incentive for teachers in the region will also assist in expanding the coverage of the Remote Area Allowance program
This research examined the relationship between the Remote Area Allowance program and teacher absentee levels, as well as the influence of teacher attendance levels on the quality and achievements of students
Thus, further research using other indicators aside from teacher absentee levels is needed in order to more comprehensively measure the level of effectiveness of the Remote Area Allowance program
A Rapid Appraisal of the Implementation of the 2005 Direct Cash Transfer Program in Indonesia
A Case Study in Five Kabupaten/Kota
ABSTRACT
This report is the result of a rapid assessment of the first phase of the direct cash transfer program that is one part of the fuel subsidy reduction compensation program that is provided to poor households
The early observation and assessment of the administration of this program was needed in order to know the level of achievement of the program and its problems so it can be used as the basis for improving its administration and for planning programs of this type in the future
This assessment was undertaken using a qualitative methodology through in-depth interviews with a number of respondents and the quantitative analysis of secondary data
The investigation results show that time contraints for every phase of the direct cash transfer program, starting from the targeting process, socialization, card distribution, funds allocation to the handling of problems made the implementation appear ”rushed” and its hastiness had an impact on the success of each phase of the implementation
The socialization program is the phase that was assessed as the weakest because it was not done intensively
especially in connection with institutions at the local level that had not yet been formed
In general, other phases of the program implementation proceeded well, although mistargeting triggered the emergence of conflict as the result of social jealousy
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The rise in the price of fuel oil (BBM) on 1 October 2005 added to the financial burden on the lives of the community
To ease this burden, the government implemented the Direct Cash Transfer (SLT) for poor households that were identified by Statistics Indonesia (BPS) through the use of proxy-means testing methodology
Every household receives Rp100,000 per month that is provided once each quarter
For the first phase of the distribution that was realized on 1 October 2005, the government made Rp4.6 trillion available for approximately 15.5 million households
The distribution of funds was undertaken by PT Pos Indonesia through its branch offices
This report was written on the basis of the results of SMERU's rapid appraisal of the implementation of SLT between 22 November-3 December 2005 in five kabupaten/kota
This appraisal was intended to obtain an actual picture of the first phase of the SLT implementation as lessons for improvements in distribution in future phases
This study used a qualitative approach by conducting in-depth interviews with 93 recipient households, 30 non-recipient households and a number of key informants at various levels of government
In addition, five Focus Group Discussions (FGD) were conducted with kabupaten/kota authorities/figures, 10 with village authorities/figures and 12 with household recipients
The analysis used is qualitative analysis supplemented with a quantitative analysis of the targeting data
The research results show that the limited time available made the SLT implementation seem “rushed” and, in turn, impact on the success of the implementation of each phase and the whole program
This study found mistargeting although the incidence was relatively low 
indicated by the number of non-poor households that became SLT recipients (leakage) and the number of poor households that have not yet received payments (undercoverage)
Several factors are believed to be behind the mistargeting
1) the disparity in the capacities of the enumerators as they were not supported by adequate training and guidance; 
2) the rather high level of subjectivity of the enumerators and local area unit (SLS) heads; 
3) the screening procedure for poor households was not done carefully; 
4) enumerators did not always come to the households that were being assessed; 
5) indications of the existence of a quota for target households down to the RT level; 
6) poverty indicators that were not sensitive enough to capture the whole socio-economic condition of households; 
7) an incomplete choice of answers; and 
8) the concept of the household and family as the SLT recipient unit was not clearly determined
The quantitative analysis shows that
1) the district targeting allocations were quite good (65.8%), meaning kecamatan that have more poor people received more KKB cards; 
2) targeting at the household level shows varying results; 
3) checking of the completion of household respondent forms shows a high level of consistency (78.3%) but there are inter-variable and inter-district variations; 
4) a simulation of the results of the data collection on respondents shows that the cut-off point of 0.2 that is used by BPS to determine the target is too low with the result that households that are unsuitable can become recipients; and 
5) there were indications that supplementary household registration was less selective
Household SLT recipients were given an identity card in the form of a BBM Compensation Card (KKB)
The delivery of KKBs to recipient households varied between districts
Some were delivered by BPS officials, some also via the local government or enumerators
The means of delivery also varied, some were done from house to house, some also collectively by gathering recipients at a certain location
The problems that emerged in the distribution of KKB included
1) inconsistency between the identity of the recipient with the data included on the KKB; 
2) cases of delays in the distribution of KKB at the request of the community; 
3) cases of levies for transport costs by officials distributing cards to recipients; 
4) several KKB cards that were cancelled/confiscated not yet delivered to BPS; and 
5) information on cancelled KKB cards not always being known by the post office
Several impediments were found in the distribution of SLT funds, including
1) the minimal number of officials in each post office; 
2) recipients who live far-away have to pay for the cost of transport which is quite difficult for them; 
3) the tendency for recipients to collect the funds on the first day of distribution resulted in long queues; and 
4) the lack of clarity on operational funds became the reason for not undertaking mobile services or the provision of additional service posts in several regions
The appointment of PT Pos Indonesia as the distribution agent for SLT funds was assessed as appropriate by many because of their broad experience in servicing community funds transfers, their offices are located in most kecamatan, and considered relatively free of corruption
In several regions whose distribution process ran smoothly, the post office did the following
1) determined the schedule of distribution that was well publicized; 
2) coordinated with local authorities; 
3) added posts or payment counters, or became more pro-active for districts that are relatively far away
In general, recipients collected the SLT funds directly, with the exception of the elderly and the sick
Most recipients collected the funds by presenting only the KKB
Some districts also required the presentation of identification cards (KTP) that recipients did not always have
This condition was exploited by some village authorities to demand payment for preparing more expensive identification
Recipients obtained the full amount of Rp300,000 in funds from the post office
Levies were applied at the community level, both voluntary and not, including for village authorities, enumerators, RT heads or other poor households who were not SLT recipients
In general, recipients used the funds for consumption needs, with only a small part used to pay off debt, the cost of medical treatment, schoolchildren's needs, additional capital or saved
The emergence of various problems of targeting and distribution was associated with the weakness of the socialization program
This deficiency occurred at all stages of the implementation, starting from the data collection to the complaint mechanism
It could be said that the socialization to the communities essentially did not take place
Meanwhile, although the socialization for a series of local government authorities was undertaken, it was rather late and the information was only on the data collection plan
This was made worse by the unavailability of comprehensive program operational guidelines at the local government level
In fact, several documents from the central government that are related to SLT program and that could actually provide the legal basis for local government (such as Inpres, SK Menko Kesra and SK Mendagri) were late in arriving or, in fact, were not received at all
The minimal socialization during the data collection phase could have reduced the appearance of the moral hazard in determining the target
Nevertheless, the lack of a comprehensive socialization effort gave rise to misperceptions and social jealousy
Institutionally, in the region no-one felt responsible for conducting the socialization program
Meanwhile, the Minister for Communications and Information, as the party responsible for national socialization, only conducted this through the print and electronic media which could only be accessed by certain groups
The dissemination of brochures on the criteria for poor households, apart from arriving late (21 November 2005), was limited and less than informative for the general community
In addition, institutions that handle complaints and program monitoring were also not operating in all districts, although the ministerial decrees of the Minister for Home Affairs (No
541/2475/SJ) and the Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare (No
B.244/Menko/Kesra/IX/2005) for complaints and monitoring were found
SLT poskos were only found in Demak and Ternate and that was also only at the kabupaten/kota level
Information on the existence of poskos and the available complaint mechanism was also not widely disseminated to the community so there were variations in the complaints channel
Mistargeting that was worsened by an inadequate socialization program, especially on the target criteria and program objectives, triggered the emergence of community dissatisfaction
Community dissatisfaction was expressed in various forms, starting from complaints, protests or demonstrations, making threats to vandalism
Complaints in the form of protest actions and threats were usually handled by the village head assisted by security/police authorities
In several regions, the kabupaten/kota and kecamatan authorities as well as BPS also intervened
Protest actions and threats can be stifled by
1) the opening of supplementary registrations for those who felt they had an entitlement; 2) the willingness of SLT recipients to share some of the funds with other poor households; and 3) officials who promise that supplementary registrations will receive the SLT in the following phase
In general, the coordination and communication on the implementation of the SLT was considered weak
This was indicated from
1) documents from the central government on the SLT were late or, in fact, were not received by the local government; 2) data collection on poor households was conducted before Inpres No
12 of 2005 was issued; 3) the coordinating meeting at the ministerial level within the Coordinating Ministry of People's Welfare (16 September 2005) imprecisely interpreted this Inpres, namely the duty of the Ministry of Home Affairs which was initially as the coordinator of implementation and supervision but was later shifted into supervision and complaint handling
For that reason, one of the functions of the local government as the instrument of the Ministry of Home Affairs to coordinate the SLT implementation was not carried out and local government felt they were not officially involved in the implementation of the SLT program
The local government also questioned the commitment of central government to the implementation of political decentralization and regional autonomy because the SLT is centralized and implemented by institutions that are also centralized (BPS and PT Pos Indonesia)
The non-transparent nature of the data collection process and the determination of SLT recipients were felt to be in contradiction with the democratization process that is still underway
In this regard, there was a conflict between the law that prevents BPS from publicizing respondents' identities (Law No
16 of 1997 on statistics) with the democratic need to consult with the local public on intended SLT recipients
When the results of the data collection on poor households gave rise to socio-political unrest, the central government seriously asked local governments to take “security” steps, including through the formation of complaints poskos
In this regard, local government was put in the position of being a trouble-shooter
The limited bureaucracy of the administration of the SLT Program, which was entrusted entirely to BPS and the post office, was the key to the program's efficiency
The problem that then arose was more the result of these two program implementers being agencies whose employees normally work by applying a technical approach, while poverty is a problem that contains social, economic, and political dimensions and requires a comprehensive approach
The FGD results show that the level of recipient satisfaction with the implementation of the SLT was, in general, highest compared to the satisfaction level of village and kabupaten/kota authorities/figures
This is understandable because recipients are the group that benefits from the program
Both recipients as well as authorities at the village and kabupaten/kota level assessed the socialization to be the least satisfying aspect
Meanwhile, the method of funding disbursement and distribution of KKB cards was the most satisfying aspect
The results of in-depth interviews of non-recipient households also show a level of satisfaction that is not very different
There were differences in the evaluation of the SLT as a program
Some authorities were in less agreement because they considered it to be a “program that only provided a fish rather than a fishhook”
Some other authorities agree as long as there is no mistargetting in its implementation
Meanwhile the recipient community feels assisted by the SLT and they believe the program does not negatively impact their work ethic
Against the background of these findings, the following are several policy suggestions for the conduct of funding disbursement in the following stages
1
BPS and the post office continue as the main SLT managers in the field
It is suggested that these two institutions, in addition to being responsible to their superior agencies, also have responsibility or report their activities to the bupati/mayor in each of their working districts
2
The Ministry of Home Affairs needs to assign kabupaten/kota governments to coordinate all administration and supervision activities for the SLT in accordance with Inpres No 12 of 2005
In undertaking this duty, the local government should immediately establish an integrated posko at all levels of government (kabupaten/kota, kecamatan and village) that involves BPS, the post office and the police
3
The duty of local government should be implemented within the framework of the routine activities of regional government administration
The operational costs of implementation should be borne by the APBD, especially for poor regions which should be provided via special allocation funds (DAK)
4
It should be clearly determined whether the concept of poor family or poor household will be used
At the least, in the same district, a uniform concept should be used
5
KKB cards for households that are not suitable recipients have to be immediately cancelled by the posko
For households that refuse their cancellation, their funds can be blocked by the post office
6
Cancelled KKB cards should be immediately delivered to the kabupaten/kota BPS and the post office should be informed in order to avoid funding misuse by people who have no entitlement
7
The posko should immediately undertake verification and research of supplementary household recipients
The verification and research should be done from house to house
If there is insufficient time, this can be done via a community consultation (musyawarah) at the village level
8
The distribution of KKB cards to supplementary household recipients by the posko has to be in accordance with the KKB distribution guidelines from BPS
9
The names of SLT household recipients, including the results of the supplementary data collection, need to be published in public places at the SLS level
In the matter of validating the accuracy of targeting, the community should be given the opportunity to submit their objections to the closest posko within a certain timeframe
10
To improve the system of coordination and communication, the central government has to ensure that all documents that it issues are received by each kabupaten/kota government administration
11
The central government has to support the implementation of program socialization for the community using various channels, namely regional government, various print and electronic media, the distribution and widespread circulation of more informative and communicative brochures
The socialization material should especially emphasize the program aims, criteria for program recipients, and the availability and function of coordinating posts
12
The post office needs to prepare a complete and clear schedule for the funding allocation for each village as well as broadly disseminate the information
13
The post office needs to be flexible in distributing the funds, for example by providing mobile posts or opening service posts at the village level
14
Consideration needs to be given to the requirement for identification such as a KTP when funds are dispersed with the aim of minimizing funding digressions
This needs to be supported by a policy on the production of identity cards (KTP) that is easy, cheap or free
15
There needs to be clear law enforcement of every form of program violation, such as the falsification of information and levies on recipients
The issuing of sanctions and their notification will have the effect of dissuading the community and other authorities from commiting such violations
INTRODUCTION In the context of reducing the oil (BBM) subsidy, on 1 October 2005, the Government of Indonesia increased the price of BBM
The level of this increase was high compared with previous price increases, on the order of 87.5% for petrol, 104.8% for diesel and 185.7% for kerosene
This decision was based on the following conditions
1) a sharp jump in the world price of oil, resulting in increasingly large provisions of subsidy funds that were having an increasing burden on the budget, 2) subsidies have, until now, tended to favor the middle and upper class of society (particularly on kerosene, see, for example, Sumarto and Suryahadi, 2001); and 3) the large price difference between the domestic and international price triggered the smuggling of oil out of Indonesia
The BBM price rise added more burden to people's lives
They not only face the price rise for BBM, but also a sequence of rises in various goods and services that followed
The price rise had a direct impact on the declining purchasing power of most of the community, especially poor households
To ease this burden, the government issued Inpres No
12 of 2005 on the implementation of Direct Cash Transfer (SLT) to poor households
A poor household is defined as a household that has a per capita monthly income of Rp175,000 or less
They are identified by BPS by using a proxy-means testing methodology
This assistance program was planned within the framework of compensation for reduced BBM subsidies
For this purpose, the government set aside compensation funds for approximately 15.5 million poor households/families
Each poor household/family received Rp100,000/month provided quarterly
For the first phase of the SLT disbursement that was conducted on 1 October 2005, the government set aside funding of Rp4.6trillion
The disbursement of SLT funds to poor households/families was undertaken by PT Pos Indonesia through their branches across Indonesia
Learning from past experience, the disbursement of BBM subsidy compensation funds always faces a variety of problems
Moreover, the SLT program was set up in a short timeframe (approximately three months) under the pressure of continuing jumps in the price of BBM on the international market
For that reason, there needs to be early monitoring and evaluation of its implementation in order to look for a solution to various obstacles and technical weaknesses in the field
In that regard, the SMERU Research Institute with the support of World Bank funding, undertook a rapid appraisal of the implementation of the SLT program between 22 November and 3 December 2005
This appraisal was conducted in five kabupaten/kota that were purposively selected, namely Kabupaten Cianjur (West Java), Kabupaten Demak (Central Java), Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah (North Sumatra), Kabupaten Bima (NTB), and Kota Ternate (North Maluku)
RESEARCH OBJECTIVES This research was intended to obtain an actual picture of the implementation of the first tranche of the SLT disbursement in order to draw the lessons learned that can serve as input for improving the disbursement in the following tranches and for planning similar programs in the future
This research is specifically aimed at ascertaining
The determination mechanism of poor SLT recipient households that includes institutions involved in data collection, the criteria used, implementation of data collection, checking of data validity, and the influence of local figures in the identification of poor households
The implementation of SLT policy that encompasses program socialization, distribution of KKB cards, SLT distribution mechanism, accuracy of the total funds received and their uses by poor households and complaint handling and supervision
Preliminary indications of the impact of the program on the poverty reduction effort and the level of community satisfaction on the SLT program
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 3.1
Rationale for Selecting Research Sample Location The smoothness of the implementation of the first tranche of SLT disbursement in various districts in Indonesia varies
Based on information from various mass media outlets and BPS internal reports, districts were found that are relatively problem-free or conducive, and vice versa, there are also districts that were found to be relatively problematic or unconducive in resepct to the amount of social disturbance, protest actions, and anarchistic actions from some in the community against the implementation of the SLT
To capture the variation in information on the SLT implementation, SMERU visited five kabupaten/kota that are representative of these two conditions, as well as covering a number of dispersed locations, providing SMERU a research area that can generate baseline data on poor households as a standard for comparison
Kota Ternate, Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah, and Kabupaten Cianjur were chosen because they are categorized as conducive districts
Meanwhile Kabupaten Bima and Kabupaten Demak were chosen because they include districts that are not conducive
Whether a kabupaten/kota is conducive or not does not always reflect the same condition in the whole area of this kabupaten/kota
In kabupaten/kota that were evaluated as conducive, there were still parts that were not conducive and vice versa
Because of that, in each sample kabupaten/kota, two villages were chosen that each represent a conducive or unconducive area
In total, there were five conducive villages and five that were not conducive details can be seen in Table 3.1
From each sample village, two hamlets/kampung/street/RW, and two to four RT were determined on the basis of the number and level of concentration of SLT program recipients
Early in the determination of sample kabupaten/kota, SMERU was informed that Cianjur was a conducive SLT implementation area
Information on the presence of community disturbances was obtained in the lead-up to the field visit
However, because contact had already been made with various local institutions and in Cianjur there were areas that were still found to be conducive, Kabupaten Cianjur was still chosen as a sample district
The village of Cibulakan in this kabupaten was chosen as representative of a conducive village, and at the same time is a research site for SMERU's Community Based Monitoring System (CBMS)
Meanwhile, the village of Giri Mulya was chosen because there is a relatively high level of community turbulence, such as demonstrations at the village office and threats to the safety of village officials and enumerators
It appears that the conflict that occurred in Kota Ternate did not have an impact on the implementation of the SLT program
The program ran relatively smoothly and only a few minor problems were found
The villages of Kampung Pisang and Fitu were chosen in Ternate
Although these two locations are located in the same kecamatan, namely South Ternate, each, in fact, represents interesting criteria
In Kampung Pisang, that was also a location for the SMERU study Moving out of Poverty – MOoP, and is located in the city center, there was concern that there could be disturbances because it is the urban village worst affected by the previous conflict
This was not proven, however, as the SLT ran safely and smoothly
Meanwhile, in Fitu, located relatively far from Kota Ternate, the greatest community disturbance for the size of Kota Ternate occurred in the form of the stoning of the village office
In addition, the number of supplementary registrations from this location was high compared with other urban sites
3.2
Number and Type of Respondents Information was collected from respondents and key informants who were involved in, or were interested in the implementation of the SLT, starting from the kabupaten/kota, kecamatan, village level, and down to the community
At the kabupaten/kota level, respondents visited included of BPS, post office, and local government officials involved in the program, such as those from the social prosperity sections, assistants or regional secretaries, Bappeda, BKKBN, local media and NGOs
Respondents at the kecamatan level were BPS officials who were statistics assistants (mantis) or coordinators (KSK), post office workers and the sub-district head (camat)
Meanwhile, at the village and community level, village heads, enumerators, RW/RT/hamlet heads, recipient households and poor households that did not receive the SLT were met (see Table 3.2)
There was a minimum of 18 recipient households and six non-recipient households in each kabupaten/kota
In total, there were 93 recipient households and 37 non-recipient households interviewed in the five research sites
The methodology that was used in this research was a qualitative methodology that was complemented by a quantitative analysis of secondary data
The choice of research location from the kabupaten/kota level down to the village was purposively selected based on information from the mass media, BPS and other associated agencies
The choice of SLT recipient household respondents was determined randomly from a list of recipient households in the smallest local area units (SLS), like the RT or hamlet
Meanwhile, non-recipient household respondents were purposively selected based on information from the hamlet/RW/RT head, namely non-recipient households that reregistered as SLT recipients or were assessed as the poorest
Data was collected in the form of primary and secondary data
Secondary data was collected from implementing agencies, including 
1) data on the number of SLT recipients (Target and Realization); 
2) data on the number of poor families in each kabupaten (BKKBN and BPS); 
3) data on the number of supplementary SLT registered households; 
4) household welfare data based on the results of SMERU's Community- Based Monitoring System 
5) several regulations that provide the basis for the implementation of the program, including Inpres, decrees of the Minister for Home Affairs (Mendagri), Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare (Menko Kesra) and district heads (Bupati)
Meanwhile, the primary data was obtained through in-depth interviews of all respondents and key informants by the use of a question manual
In addition, the gathering of information was also undertaken through focus group discussions (FGD) for community leaders/authorities at the kabupaten/kota and village level, as well as SLT recipient households
Each FGD had six to ten participants
FGDs at the kabupaten level and with village figures also involved a number of elements
FGDs at the kabupaten/kota level were attended by representatives of BPS, post office, local government, Bappeda, BKKBN, local media, NGOs and higher education institutions
Meanwhile, the FGDs with village officials were attended by village staff, RT/RW/hamlet/area heads, enumerators, religious figures and community figures
FGDs were conducted five times in each kabupaten/kota, once at the kabupaten/kota level, twice at the village level and twice at the community level
In total, SMERU conducted five FGDs with kabupaten/kota officials, ten FGDs with village authorities and 12 FGDs with SLT recipient housholds
3.3
Research Schedule In total, this research activity took two and a half months
The research preparation started in early November 2005, in the form of a proposal preparation, preparation of credentials, letter of appointment, field researcher contacts, discussion of research method and intensification of the material (program and research)
Field work was conducted over ten to 12 days, between 22 November and 3 December
The main findings, including program recommendations, as well as the draft report were finalized in mid-December
The final report was completed in mid-January 2006 after being supplemented by input from the workshop that was held in the same month
3.4
Number and Membership of the Research Team A total of 11 SMERU researchers were directly involved in this research, consisting of one adviser, Dr Sudarno Sumarto, and 10 researchers, Hastuti, Syaikhu Usman, Bambang Sulaksono, Nina Toyamah, Sri Budiyati, Wenefrida Dwi Widyanti, Meuthia Rosfadhila, Hariyanti Sadaly, Sufiet Erlita and R Justin Sodo
The ten researchers were divided into five teams that each had responsibility for undertaking the research in one kabupaten/kota
In addition, each team was assisted by a local researcher from a list consisting of Basyri Nasution, Erwin Romulas, G Kelik Agus E., Bakri, Syahbudin Hadid, and Abdul Kadir Kamaluddin
Because of this, one team consisted of two SMERU researchers and one local researcher
SMERU also included Sami Bazzi, a guest researcher to provide input to the field report
FINDINGS 4.1
Targeting Micro poverty data was necessary for the determination of the target of an intervention program at the household or family level
The data collection on poor families/households at the national level for the targeting of SLT recipients is known as Socio-economic Data Collection on the Population 2005 (PSE05)
4.1.1
Data Collection Process BPS was the institution responsible for implementing the data collection on these poor families/households
In each kecamatan, BPS placed a kecamatan statistics coordinator (KSK) who was assisted by an assistant (PKSK)
Most KSK are mantis and some others were staff of the kabupaten/kota BPS that were appointed because not all kecamatan have a mantis
On the other hand, PKSK usually come from the local kecamatan staff who are recruited for one month by BPS, but there are also some from the staff of BPS itself
In the conduct of the data collection, because of the limitation of time and personnel, as well as referring to the documentation of Mendagri, BPS included the village administration authorities and BPS associates as enumerators (PCL)
Enumerators worked under the coordination of KSK and PKSK
Selection and training of enumerators The selection mechanism for enumerators was given to each kabupaten/kota BPS and was one of the responsibilities of the KSK
In general, the KSK requested the opinion of the village head in determining the enumerator in their area
In the majority of sample regions, the recruitment process for enumerators was undertaken via appointment by the village head to his staff
KSK only provided criteria that the appointed enumerator should have experience in census taking, while education was not specified as a strict condition
Meanwhile, in Tapanuli Tengah and in most kecamatan in Demak, KSK had more of a role in determining the enumerators
With the facilitation of kecamatan and village officials, the KSK appointed associates of BPS who have had experience in data processing
In almost all the sample regions, most enumerators have a minimum level of education of senior high school, except in Cianjur where most were primary school graduates and in Tapanuli Tengah where most were junior high school graduates
The number of enumerators per village and the scope of their responsibility varied between districts
In Ternate, Cianjur, and Demak, the responsibility of an enumerator was based on the number of the smallest SLS or RT, which had 3-4 RT, 7-8 RT, and 8-9 RT respectively
Meanwhile, in Bima and Tapanuli Tengah, the number of enumerators was not based on SLS, and each village was handled by two enumerators
Before carrying out their duties, KSK undertook training by national instructors (BPS Central Office) that was conducted at the provincial level for two days
Following the training, the KSK became the regional instructor for providing the training to enumerators in their respective work areas
The training material for enumerators included
data collection phases, how to fill forms and questionnaires as well as knowledge on the standard concepts needed in the data collection exercise
The training method for enumerators varied
In Ternate, apart from the delivery of theoretical material, test pilot interviews were also conducted with several of the nearest RT heads who were invited to the training location
In Tapanuli Tengah, enumerators were invited into the field and given a direct picture of poor households
These methods provided a positive contribution to the data collection activity
In addition, in the training, enumerators were instructed on the ethics associated with their duties and responsibilities
In Tapanuli Tengah, it was emphasized that when registering poor households, any feelings of personal like or dislike for the household, resentment, or whether the household should or should not be registered, should be avoided
In Ternate, all officials were ordered to truly conduct the data collection and to follow the established regulations with devoutness
These special messages also appear to have had a positive impact on the performance of the enumerators
The training of enumerators was, in general, conducted in 1 day
According to the regulation, the training of enumerators was scheduled for 1–14 August 2005
The training was, however, implemented in accordance with the conditions in each district
In Cianjur and Ternate, the training was undertaken in accordance with the time determined
while in other areas, it was later than scheduled, for example, in Kecamatan Karangtengah, Demak it was conducted between 18-19 August 2005
The conduct of the data collection Officially, BPS determined that the data collection would be conducted from 15 August–15 September 2005
In its implementation, data collection was conducted after the enumerators received the training
In almost all sample kabupaten/kota, the implementation phases of the data collection on poor families/households did not entirely follow the flow-chart that had been determined for enumerators (see Figure 1)
After obtaining the list of poor households from the SLS head, the enumerator should have used or considered the existence of other data sources as the reference for completing the list of poor households in the PSE05.LS form
Subsequently, enumerators undertook field verification to determine the suitability or otherwise of registered households as well as adding poor households that were not yet registered
Afterwards, the enumerator had to approach each poor household to register them in the PSE05.RT
In practice, after obtaining the list of poor households from the SLS head, the enumerator usually conducted the data collection on poor households immediately with the PSE05.RT list
Indeed, in general, the enumerators commenced the process of capturing poor households by asking the SLS head (RT or hamlet) to prepare a list of families/households believed to be poor according to the concept given during the training, namely those who are very much in need of assistance to fulfill their essential needs (food, education/schooling, and health)
However, most enumerators in almost all sample regions did not consider the presence of other sources of data in completing the PSE05.LS form
In the registration process for poor households using the PSE05.LS form, obstacles and problems, both general and case-by-case in nature, arose
- A variety of understandings on poverty
In Bima, the concept of poverty was classified into three categories
very poor for those who experience food problems, poor for those experiencing problems in accessing health services and almost poor for those experiencing problems in access to education
In some regions there was a tendency to include widows in the register of poor households although some of them live with their reasonably well-off children
- The smallest unit that was used as the target was still unclear, being a household or family
As a consequence, there were poor families who live under the responsibility of other families that were registered, and vice versa, there were also poor families who are not registered because in their household there were other poor families who were already registered
- The subjectivity of enumerators and SLS heads
They tended to include people living close to them first without considering their poverty condition
Cases like this were found, among other places, in Desa Berahan Wetan, Demak that was followed by a demand from the community for the dismissal of the enumerator from his job as a teacher
- The enumerators themselves made the list of households that were considered poor (PSE05.LS) without consulting with the SLS head (RT)
Cases like this were found in Demak and Ternate, among others
In Ternate, because the enumerator failed to meet with the head of the RT, the PSE05.LS list was filled on the basis of the register of raskin (rice for the poor) recipients, in addition to information that the enumerator already knew
- In Tapanuli Tengah, there were enumerators who came directly to poor households to complete the PSE05.RT list first of all, then filled in the PSE05.LS form
- Most officials did not register households based on the order of their poverty condition or by, at least, grouping them as poorest, poor, and almost poor
- There were indications of a quota of registered households down to the smallest SLS (RT)
In Demak, one KSK requested that households registered in each SLS be limited to no more than 30%, in Cianjur it varied between 30%-50%, while in Bima there was a maximum quota of 50% of all households, each SLS was only provided with 25 PSE05.RT forms
In Tapanuli Tengah, indications of a quota were seen from the number of PSE05.RT forms that were distributed
Meanwhile in Ternate, the SLS heads and enumerators did not feel that there was a quota because they could register any number of households and the additional PSE05.RT forms they requested were provided
- There were households that were not included or were deleted from the PSE05.LS list because there were the same registration limitations for all SLS without considering the proportion of poverty in each area
Because this list, in general, was not put together on the basis of poverty conditions and deletions tended to be done on the lowest sequence, there were concerns that poor households or, in fact, those that are very poor, were deleted
This concern was strengthened by the fact there were still households classified as poor but not registered
The field verification phase, especially via direct observation was not always undertaken by enumerators, with the exception of Ternate
The neglect of this phase by most enumerators appears to be not entirely their fault
When examining the contents of the field administration manual that became the guide for KSK/PKSK and enumerators, it appears that the verification stage was not included
The enumerators, in general, immediately undertook the census with the PSE05.RT questionnaire in every household in the PSE05.LS list
If the field verification or personal observation was well and correctly undertaken, there would certainly be a probability that several households in the PSE05.LS were deleted when the relevant party was deemed unsuitable as a poor household and, furthermore, did not need to be enumerated with the household questionnaire
The absence of verification is supported by data in Table 4.1 that shows that in Tapanuli Tengah, Cianjur, Demak, and Bima, the number of registered households was the same as the number of enumerated households
The difference in the number of registered households with the number of enumerated ones only occurred in Ternate, in the amount of 725 households
This shows that there were attempts by enumerators to check first, so all households that were submitted by the SLS head were not immediately considered suitable and enumerated
During the household census phase (the completion of the PSE05.RT), with the exception of Ternate and Tapanuli Tengah, most enumerators confess to not always approaching and directly interviewing registered households (PSE05.LS)
The reason being that the enumerator already knew the household condition well or had information from previous data collections, such as the Voters' Registration (Pendaftaran Pemilih) and the Sustainable Population Data Collection System (P4B) in 2003
The non-attendance of enumerators in every household on whom data was collected was supported by 36.6% of the 93 household respondents who admitted that they were not approached by an enumerator
In addition, approximately 47.5% of the 59 households visited by enumerators admit that the enumerator only asked some of the questions in the PSE05.RT
From a procedural perspective, the non-attendance of enumerators at households that were enumerated was a mistake that contributed to the level of errors in data collection, especially those that were non-technical in nature
However, given the time constraint and the fact that enumerators were already well-acquainted with their area of operation, this appears understandable for many stakeholders, including BPS, and so there were no sanctions for this neglect
It also appears that BPS did not tightly supervise the conduct of this data collection
Completed PSE05.RT forms were collected by the KSK and submitted to the kabupaten/kota BPS for data entry
In several districts, some data-entry activities were undertaken in the provincial BPS office
The data-entry process for census results had already commenced when the field census activity was still ongoing
At the time of the document gathering, the KSK should have checked the completion of the PSE05.RT, at least for one of the first SLS
The assumption being that if the completion of one set of documents was correct, there was a high probability that the results of the completion of the ensuing documents would not be significantly different
However, once again because of the time constraint, according to one enumerator, the KSK did not conduct a check on the document contents, but only checked that the total number of PSE05.RT documents was consistent with the number of households registered in the PSE05.LS
Because of this, several mistakes were encountered, such as several parts of the form being skipped, inconsistency between the contents of the left column with the validation of the contents in the right column
The data entry results at the kabupaten/kota and provincial BPS were sent to the BPS central office for poverty score enumeration
After determining the number and name of poor recipient households, the data was sent to PT Pos Indonesia for the production of identity cards for poor households that are known as BBM compensation cards (KKB)
The weakness of poverty variables Apart from the data collection procedure, the instruments or variables that were used to identify poor families/households also received a lot of attention
Many stakeholders, even in community circles, considered the variables used to determine the poverty criteria to be insensitive to the entire socio-economic condition of households
For that reason, from in-depth interviews and discussions that were conducted, many regret that variables such as income, house ownership as well as land ownership and size were not included
In addition, most of the people also hold the opinion that poverty is relative, meaning poverty in one district does not determine poverty in other districts, so local poverty variables should also be considered
The choices of answers for each variable were considered to have caused confusion in completion
As an example, the variable on type of floor only provided two options, namely a low-quality dirt/bamboo/wood floor and a high-quality cement/ceramic/wooden floor
In reality, a lot of houses with low-quality cement floors were found, so the enumerator had difficulty in classifying the choice of answer
The same example is on the variable on type of wall
The answer for main source of lighting that only provided a choice between electric and non-electric lighting without differentiating whether the electricity meter used was the household's own or shared (nyambung), was also considered less sensitive because in reality there are still many households that share electricity with a very limited allocation of power
4.1.2
Targeting accuracy To look at the level of accuracy of the SLT program target, a qualitative and quantitative approach was taken
Qualitatively, the observations of the SMERU team as well as answers from most respondents showed that there was a relatively low level of mistargeting
This is indicated from the existence of non-poor households that became SLT recipients (leakage) and poor households that have not yet been recipients (undercoverage), but the total number is not large
The quantitative approach that was conducted via a variety of analyses also showed the presence of mistargeting with a prevalence that varied between the various types of analysis
Correlation analysis
the population of the poor resulting from the BPS 2000 or SMERU poverty mapping with the number of KKB recipients The correlation analysis at the kecamatan level between the poor population from the BPS and SMERU poverty mapping in 2000 with the number of KKB recipient households in the five research locations shows a level of closeness that is relatively high (65.8%) and significant
In each kabupaten/kota, the level of correlation varies with the lowest range in Cianjur (47.9%) and highest in Ternate (96.3%)
Based on the poverty rank with the Spearman rank correlation, in most study locations there is a higher correlation level and a significant value, except for Kabupaten Bima (see Table 4.2)
It was found that the geographic targeting allocation of the SLT program at the kecamatan level was quite good, meaning the regions with a higher number of poor also obtained relatively more KKB cards
Benefit incidence analysis
the Demak case The targeting accuracy at the household level shows varying results, even within the same kabupaten/kota
As an illustration, a simple benefit incidence analysis was undertaken by using as a data base the results of the CBMS research that was undertaken by SMERU with data on KKB recipients for the villages of Jungpasir and Kedondong, Demak
From Table 4.3, part a, it can be seen that the ‘poor' and ‘almost poor' groups (Q1 and Q2) only received 54.7% of all KKB cards received by Desa Jungpasir
This means a mistargeting rate of approximately 45.3%
This table also shows the existence of undercoverage because only 48.4% of poor households (Q1) and 42.9% of the ‘almost poor' (Q2) in this district received KKB cards
At the same time, Table 4.3, part b, provides an illustration of the distribution of KKB cards for Kelurahan Kedondong with a better level of targeting accuracy than in the Desa Jungpasir
The ‘poor' and ‘almost poor' groups (Q1 and Q2) received around 65.6% of all KKB cards for this village
This means that a mistargeting rate of around 34.4% was found
From the perspective of coverage, there were suitable households found that were not included because only 74.6% of ‘poor' households (Q1) received KKB cards and 45% of ‘almost poor' (Q2)
Analysis of the conformity of the completion of PSE05.RT and the target determination process by BPS and SMERU In this SLT research, SMERU also repeated the data collection on 93 households by using the PSE05.RT questionnaire (like that conducted by BPS)
This was conducted with the aim of looking at the consistency of the census and evaluating the target determination process
Although only based on a limited sample that is not sufficiently representative to completely evaluate the BPS data collection, the following analysis can provide an illustration on the implementation of the census of poor households with the PSE05.RT
The errors that emerged in the enumeration as well as the determination of the suitability or otherwise of families/households as KKB recipients was expected to help provide an illustration of the cause of the mistargeting
The level of uniformity of the completion of 19 variables (in the form of 14 indicators that were used for the determination of poor households) from 2 enumerations (BPS and SMERU) is presented in Table 4.4
This table shows that the level of intervariable and district uniformity varies, and in fact overall it is quite high at 78.3%
For several variables, the level of uniformity is relatively low, such as the floor area (40.9%), field of work (50.5%) and the number of household members (53.8%)
This is believed to be due to different perceptions in the grouping of business fields by each official as well as the use of a concept of household and family that is not clearly applied
The results of the re-enumeration by SMERU were also used to look at the process for the target determination that was conducted by the central office of BPS
By using a different weighting system for every variable in each kabupaten/kota, a score was obtained for each household within the range between 0 and 1
Furthermore, for the determination of the suitability of households to receive the SLT, a cut-off point of 0.2 was used for the score that was produced
This means that those that have a score of 0.2 or above were determined to be a poor household
From this estimation, a very high level of accuracy was found, where 92 of the 93 sample households (98.9%), indeed have a score higher than 0.2
Compared with the problems or disturbances that emerged, however, and observation of the socio-economic condition of the households, this level of targeting accuracy appears to be too high as well as not reflecting the reality in the field
For that, a sensitivity analysis was conducted by applying a cut-off point that varied from 0.3 to 0.6 to the same data
From this simulation, an estimation result was obtained on the level of targeting accuracy from the SLT recipient household sample for this study that ranged between 98.9% for the cut-off point of 0.3 up to 76.3% for the cut-off point of 0.6
By using the cut-off point of 0.4, several SLT recipient households in the first phase that were evaluated as unsuitable on the basis of direct field observation could be eliminated
From here it can be seen that the determination of the cut-off point has a very important role in the process of target determination
Given that the determination of the score itself is different between kabupaten/kota, then the determination of the cut-off point should also differ for each kabupaten/kota
Correlation analysis
the population of the poor from the results of the SMERU or BPS 2000 poverty mapping with the number of supplementary households The emergence of the demand to undertake a supplementary collection of data for SLT recipients indicates that there was mistargeting
In three sample kabupaten, Tapanuli Tengah, Cianjur and Demak, the number of villagers who registered or asked to be re-processed was larger than the number of KKB recipient households in the first phase (see Table 4.5)
The supplementary registration, in general, was already undertaken and was in the process of being verified by the local BPS and was expected to be completed by 31 December 2005
In Kota Ternate, in particular, the verification process was already completed
Due to the large number of households that registered in the supplementary data collection, a correlation analysis was also conducted from the number of households in the first phase of SLT recipients and supplementary household registrations with the total number of poor from the BPS poverty map 2000, as presented in Table 4.6
The total correlation level between the level of poverty from the poverty mapping with the number of poor households from PSE05 for the five study areas in Table 4.6 is lower than the correlation in Table 4.2, only around 60.58%, with a pattern that varies for each district
It is also the same for the Spearman rank correlation, that fell from around 71% to 69.3%
Apart from Ternate, it was found that the supplementary household registration was less selective and less consistent with the allocation of the number of poor in the same district
The results of the field observation also show that there was a tendency for almost all households that were not yet registered in the first phase to be included in the supplementary data collection, without differentiating whether they were classified as suitable or unsuitable as SLT recipients
4.2
Funding Distribution 4.2.1
Distribution of KKB Cards Household recipients of the SLT were given a KKB as an identity card
The KKB card was printed by the Post Office's central office on the basis of data on household program recipients that was obtained from the BPS central office
The KKB consisted of four coupons as proof of the receipt of the funds at every stage of the distribution
In general, the KKB distribution mechanism from the center to the kabupaten/kota was conducted in accordance with procedures
The KKB was made in duplicate, with the original KKB received by the kabupaten/kota BPS to be given to the SLT recipients, while the duplicate KKB was received by the post office for the purpose of checking at the time of the funding disbursement
BPS received the original KKB cards on large sheets only a few days before the funding distribution
In this limited time period, BPS had to organize a sorting process in order to group the KKB cards according to SLS and village, as well as checking the number and condition of the cards
Moreover, in several districts, BPS put the cards in a plastic sleeve
After this process was completed, the KKB cards were distributed to recipient households in a time that varied between regions as presented in Table 4.7
According to the guidelines for the KKB distribution, the kabupaten/kota BPS office should put together a KKB distribution team in the kabupaten/kota and kecamatan facilitated by the mayor/district and sub-district head, with the involvement of the BPS, kecamatan and village officials
In its implementation, in all research locations, no such distribution team was established
BPS was the main actor in the KKB distribution, with or without the involvement of the local government
As a result, the delivery of the KKB cards from the kabupaten/kota BPS office to recipient households varied between research locations, and, in general, can be classified into four distribution channels (see Figure 2)
In Cianjur, the KKB cards were delivered in the forum of a coordinating meeting at the kabupaten level that was attended by various agencies (local government, BRI, BPS, post office, police and attorney's office) and all camat
The BPS head delivered the KKB cards symbolically to the district head (bupati) to be distributed to all camat
The next day, the camat distributed them to village heads in each kecamatan office
On the same or next day, the village head delivered the cards to the enumerators or RT heads for distribution to recipient households
In Demak and Bima, the distribution channel of the KKB cards was a little different
BPS delivered the KKB cards directly via the KSK to the village heads without going through the bupati and camat
In several kecamatan in Kabupaten Bima, community disturbances arose early in the process of distributing the KKB cards, resulting in BPS deciding to deliver the cards in stages after conditions were considered conducive or there was a security guarantee from the village head
In Bima, the distribution was also undertaken without going through the village heads, but only for a short time because there were indications of emerging disturbances
In Kota Ternate, BPS via the KSK delivered the KKB cards directly to recipient households in the company of the enumerators
Village officials were not involved at all, except officials who were enumerators
Meanwhile, in Tapanuli Tengah, BPS delivered the cards to KSK/PKSK who distributed them directly to recipients
The village head and street/hamlet heads only facilitated the recipient gatherings
The delivery means for the KKB cards from the distribution officials to recipient households also varied, even in the same districts
There were deliveries that were made door-to-door and some were done collectively by gathering recipients in a particular location
In Kabupaten Demak, Cianjur, Bima, and Tapanuli Tengah a combination of the two delivery methods was found
In Tapanuli Selatan, there was a door-to-door distribution for recipients who could not attend at the time of the gatherings
In Kota Ternate, almost all KKB cards were distributed from door-to-door by BPS staff in the company of enumerators
They were not allowed to deliver the KKB cards via anyone else
Cases of entrusting KKB cards to enumerators only occurred for three recipients because they couldn't be found at their house even though they were visited on more than one occasion
In general, the delivery of the KKB cards to recipient households was carried out smoothly
Nevertheless, several problems were found that tended to be causal, including
1) Inconsistency between the identity of the recipient with the data on the KKB card, such as differences in name and address as well as print errors
2) In three villages in Kabupaten Bima, recipient households had not yet received KKB cards when the research was being conducted
This occured because of community pressure to delay the distribution of the cards until the supplementary cards arrived so the distribution of both cards could be done simultaneously
This was intended to avoid the emergence of protest actions and other community disturbances
3) Certain distribution officials imposed transport levies on KKB recipients although the funds had already been provided by the government
In one village in Tapanuli Tengah, PKSK asked for “petrol money” from KKB recipients as a reimbursement for delivery costs
The amount of money was not fixed, some recipients gave Rp2,000 to Rp5,000, but some others gave no money
One hamlet head estimated the amount of money collected by each official as reaching up to Rp200,000
4) There are still KKB cards that were cancelled/confiscated by the KSK, enumerators or village heads that until now have not yet been returned to BPS
This was found in one village in Demak and Cianjur
5) Information on cancelled KKB cards was not always known to the post office because there was no coordination or reporting from BPS
There was concern that the last two cases above may cause losses by making the disbursement of funds possible to people who had no entitlement
Before or at the same time as the distribution of KKB cards, there should have been verification and research into the accuracy of recipient households
Households were assessed as suitable have the right to receive a KKB card, on the other hand households that were not suitable or not poor would have their cards cancelled and withheld by BPS
However, because of time constraints, BPS, in general, could not conduct the verification and research carefully
It was only done in a limited way and scope as well as varying between districts
In Cianjur, KSK conducted a limited verification and research at the same time as the KKB cards were sorted for recipients that were well-known to them
In one village in Demak and in several villages in Bima there was an initiative by village officials and enumerators to conduct the verification and cancel the KKB cards of recipients who were deemed unsuitable
In Ternate, the verification was undertaken at the same time as the distribution of the KKB cards because the cards were distributed directly by BPS officials from door-to-door
In the regions that conducted verifications relatively well, there was a tendency for the SLT distribution process to work more conducively or with relatively few community protests
The conduct of this limited verification produced a number of KKB cards that were cancelled and, furthermore, withheld by BPS
Several reasons for the cancellation of KKB cards were found, including recipients who were assessed as unsuitable, duplicate cards, unknown recipients' names and addresses or recipients who had changed address
In all sample kabupaten/kota, KKB cards that were cancelled as a result of the verification was only around 0.7% (see Table 4.8)
The rate of cancellations was highest in Kota Ternate (13.1%) and lowest in Kabupaten Demak (0.3%)
The high rate of KKB cancellations in Ternate is believed to be the result of a relatively better verification process that was done from door-to-door at the same time the KKB cards were distributed
In four sample kabupaten/kota, all KKB cards that were received, aside from the cancelled cards, have been distributed to recipient households
In Kabupaten Bima especially, there were KKB cards that had not yet been distributed due to community demands, as was discussed above in the problem of the distribution of KKB cards
4.2.2
Funds Disbursement The first phase of the funding disbursement throughout Indonesia was divided into three distribution schedules
The first distribution for 15 strategic cities commenced on 1 October 2005, the second disbursement for 24 provincial capitals and other strategic cities commenced on 5 October 2005, and the third distribution for other regions, commenced on 11 October 2005
Of the five sample kabupaten/kota, only Kota Ternate was included in the second disbursement regions, while others were in the third
In Ternate and Demak the disbursement took place in accordance with the schedule that had been determined
On the other hand, in Tapanuli Tengah this was delayed until 13 October, and Cianjur until 22 October because the KKB cards arrived late
The funds disbursement to recipient households was conducted by the post office
The appointment of the post office as the manager of the SLT funding disbursement was considered appropriate by many parties
The post office is experienced in servicing community funds transfers
There are a relatively large number of post office branches widely dispersed to the kecamatan level
In addition, the possibility of funding leakages was relatively small because the community collected them directly and the post office was evaluated as relatively free of corruption
In all research locations, the post office has several branch offices
Nevertheless, as in many other regions as well, not all kecamatan in the sample kabupaten/kota have post office branches
In addition, the number of officials in each post office branch is also limited, with an average of only 1-2 people
Finally, the number of villages and SLT recipient households that have to be serviced by one post office branch is, on average, more than 20 villages with approximately 4,000 recipients (see Table 4.9)
The limited service area of these post offices forced some SLT recipients who live far from a post office to spend a significant amount of money on transport
In several districts, recipients had to spend Rp6,000-Rp15,000 on the cost of transport
These are quite significant amounts of money for poor families, especially if it is compared with the wages of farm laborers, a lot of whom are still earning below Rp15,000/person/day
Because transport money is not always available, many recipients were forced to go into debt or walk quite a long way to reach the closest post office
This condition was compounded by the tendency of recipients to collect their SLT payments on the first disbursement day, resulting in thousands of recipients attending simultaneously and crowding the payment offices
Apart from making it uncomfortable for recipients (both physically and psychologically), it also resulted in them losing a day's work
On the other hand, this resulted in several facilities at the service locations being damaged, including broken windows and damaged chairs
The provision of the service for thousands of people in one working day also meant that it was easier for post office officials to make mistakes as the result of human error
Several post office officials, for example, forgot to remove the KKB coupon as proof of payment
A mistake for just one recipient will result in the official being responsible for Rp300,000
The post office officials were also unable to carefully check the original of the KKB card with the copy
The smoothness or otherwise of the disbursement of SLT funds was determined not only by the size of the district that had to be serviced, but also determined by the coordination and service planning with stakeholders prior to and during the funding disbursement
Several measures that were taken in several regions where the disbursement process worked smoothly were
1) The post office determined the disbursement schedule for each village by taking into consideration the number of SLT recipients that had to be served
2) The disbursement schedule was widely socialized to every village, and in fact, there were regions that attached it to the KKB card that was delivered to the recipients
3) The post office coordinated with kecamatan and village officials and local police in controling the number and queueing of recipients
4) The post office added service posts and payment counters or was pro-active in relatively distant districts
In Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah and Cianjur, the disbursement of SLT funds ran smoothly and orderly and no commotions were heard of
In these two kabupaten, a schedule was prepared that was well-socialized
In Tapanuli Tengah, the disbursement schedule was enclosed when the KKB cards were delivered to recipients
In Cianjur the disbursement schedule was made known to village heads, via telephone or village postal officials
In Cianjur, apart from being conducted in the main and branch post offices, the service was also provided pro-actively at the village level in 12 kecamatan, especially in the South Cianjur area
In each kecamatan two to five service posts were provided
The funds disbursement schedule was, in general, determined for one day per village, and each cashier serviced 500-600 people, resulting in the service being completed in half a working day
In this region, the funds disbursement was quite well prepared and coordination with officials at the kecamatan level, the police, and village officials went smoothly
Village officials and the police were involved in organizing the recipient numbers and queuing
This was possible because Cianjur was among the last regions to distribute the SLT funds so there was enough time to learn from the implementation process in other regions
Although there were also efforts to enhance the service in other districts, this did not always work well because of other factors
In Kabupaten Demak and Bima, the local post office made a disbursement schedule for every village, however it was not well socialized
As a result, the community came simultaneously, resulting in long queues, shuffling, and a few disturbances such as torn or lost KKB cards
In Kota Ternate, the dissemination of the service was not effective because of the lack of coordination between the post office and BPS on which village's KKB cards had already been distributed
In addition, the service in two villages was impeded because of the emergence of community conflict triggered by mistargeting concerns
It was finally decided that the funds disbursement will be undertaken by one main post office in each town
Up until the first phase of the funding disbursement was almost completed, the post office in the regions had not yet received clarification on who had full responsibility for the operational costs of the service
Some are of the opinion that the post office was responsible for the service costs, such as the installation of tents and the provisions for security officials
The post office hoped that there would be clear operational funds available, considering that many stakeholders are involved
In many areas, the unclear availability of operational funds was the reason for the absence of a mobile service or additional service posts that were more accessible for villages
As an example, the plan to open service posts on several islands located far from Kota Ternate has still not been undertaken and is still the subject of discussion with local governments, especially concerning available funds
Meanwhile, it is rather difficult to expect recipients to travel to the post office in Kota Ternate because they have to pay transport costs of up to Rp200,000 per person
In several kecamatan in Kabupaten Bima, there were delays in the funds disbursement because of miscommunication between the local government and the post office
This delay caused material losses (transport and accommodation costs) that were significant for recipients who came to the kecamatan office which was appointed for the distribution of funds
On 7 October 2005, the Coordinating Minister for Peoples' Welfare (Menko Kesra) stated that the government required identification in the form of a KTP or identity paper when the funds were disbursed
It appears this was not well publicized so the implementation of this varied between regions
Cianjur, Bima, and Tapanuli Tengah required proof of identity while other districts did not
Irrespective of whether there was a requirement or not, there should not have been any difficulty for adult villagers in fulfilling this requirement
In fact, it appears that there are still many recipients who do not have a KTP, because it is lost, burnt or they have never possessed one before
The post office gave a dispensation from this requirement and substituted it instead with a resident's permit, identification statement or an application form for the production of a KTP signed by the relevant village authority
This stipulation, however, provided the impetus for certain parties, especially village officials, to demand production fees between Rp50,000 and Rp80,000
In the end, in Bima, the requirement for an accompanying form of identification was not enforced and, instead, several post offices required a village official to accompany the villagers during funds disbursement
The SLT funds, in general, were collected directly by those whose names were attached to the KKB card
A limited number were also deputed to a family member if the recipient was sick or aged
For the collections that were delegated, almost all districts required a power of attorney, proof of identity or a letter from a village official confirming that a person is a recipient
Aged or ill recipients who collected their own payments were usually given special priority so they did not need to queue
In South Tapanuli, the village head collected the funds for old-age recipients
This initiative was undertaken and agreed because this village is located on an island
There was a similar arrangement in Bima that developed into a local police case
This was because this village head unilaterally took Rp50,000 per recipient as a repayment for the collection
After this case was reported to police, the village head agreed to return the concerned funds to the recipients
Recipients obtained the SLT funds from the post office in the full amount of Rp300,000 without any deductions
Demands on some recipients to share their funds with other poor households who had not received SLT payments occurred at the community level
In Cianjur, through the coordination of the RT heads, the SLT recipients on average contributed Rp50,000
In Demak, as the result of the pressure from other poor people, recipients in the two sample RT gave Rp25,000 to Rp100,000
Meanwhile, in Tapanuli Tengah at the suggestion of adat figures, recipients gave an average of Rp50,000 that will be returned during the second disbursement phase, if households that are given money become additional recipients
In Cianjur, some recipients also voluntarily provided money to enumerators and local RT heads of around Rp3,000 – Rp10,000
In general, SLT recipients admitted that quarterly disbursements are appropriate
The near poor more often wanted the disbursement all at once because the funds could be used as additional business capital
4.2.3
Funding Utilization In all research sites, almost all recipients used the SLT funds immediately after receiving them
In total, only 4.5% of recipients admitted to still having some of the funds
In general, the recipients used the funds for a variety of needs
Of 89 recipient household respondents whose funding use could be identified, 90% used the funds for consumption needs
At the kabupaten/kota level, the use of the SLT funds for consumption was most dominant, and in Cianjur and Demak it was the case for all recipients
Rice was the consumption item most often purchased because, apart from being the staple foodstuff, it could also be stored for a relatively long time
Around 23.6% of recipients used these funds to pay off debts with neighbors, stall owners or other parties who provided loans to cover daily consumption needs
Because the disbursement of SLT funds was undertaken in the lead-up to Lebaran, there were also recipients (22.5%) who used their funds to buy clothes for Lebaran
This was most commonly the case for the SLT recipients in Cianjur
Meanwhile, the number of households that utilized the funds for school fees or the cost of medical treatment was relatively small, a total of 14.6% and 11.2% respectively
Nevertheless, the availability of the funds in relation to the costs of treatment was considered to be very helpful, because at the time the SLT funds were received, several respondents were sick or unable to afford the cost of treatment, with the exception of Bima where not a single person used the SLT funds for that purpose
Recipient respondents who used the SLT funds for business capital totaled only 18%, and in Demak there were, in fact, none
In Bima and Ternate, however, almost onethird of recipients used their payments for business capital
Because the amount of money received was relatively small, the funds were, in general, only used as additional business capital, such as to buy agricultural fertilizer and seeds, adding trading stock or adding business capital for a small business
Many respondents admit that this amount of money was not enough to open a new business
4.3
Socialization The problem of weak socialization of the SLT program was experienced in almost all regions and at all stages of the implementation, starting with the data collection process, the funding disbursement through to the complaints mechanism
The local governments at all levels as well as the broad community admit to not obtaining adequate information on the SLT program
In fact, it could be said that the community socialization was not conducted
The socialization was only provided to recipient households when the KKB cards were distributed, but it was limited to information concerning the venue and schedule for the collection of funds
The community, in general, knew about the SLT program after the distribution of the KKB cards or the disbursement of the funds
They obtained the information by word of mouth, and some groups obtained the information from the media (television, radio, and newspapers)
The program socialization for local government officials was provided by BPS through a coordination meeting at the kabupaten/kota level where various agencies, sub-district heads (camat) and village heads were invited
This socialization, however, only informed local officials about the data collection plan for poor households
It was found that preceding the funding disbursement, the coordination meeting in some districts gave information on the KKB card distribution plan
Meanwhile, the in-depth socialization on the SLT was conducted internally for BPS officials and provided technical information
No institutions, at the kabupaten/kota down to village level felt responsible for conducting the socialization activity
Local governments felt that there was no clear directive on this issue, and they also never received clear information on the SLT program
Meanwhile, BPS only felt responsible for the data collection matters
The institution that was responsible for conducting the SLT socialization was actually the Menkominfo (The Ministry of Communication and Information)
The socialization undertaken by Menkominfo was, however, limited only through the print and electronic media and SMS services
While broad community access to these forms of media is still limited
Meanwhile, the socialization by distribution of brochures on the criteria for poor households that was issued by Menkominfo, apart from arriving late (21 November 2005) and in limited numbers, was also less than informative for the general community
After the funds disbursement, especially after many complaints or the emergence of community disturbances, almost all local governments conducted a socialization program for officials as well as the community in the affected district
The socialization for officials was undertaken in the context of information regarding re-registration, while for the community in order to quell conflict
In Cianjur, for example, there was a dissemination of information on the 14 variables for eligible families (see the Appendix 10
Sosialization material of the village of Cugenang in Cianjur) that was delivered through the activities of the village government or routine religious activities
The weak socialization of the program was worsened by the unavailability of comprehensive operating procedures for the program at the government level from kabupaten/kota to village
At the same time, partial guidelines in the form of a book of implementation guidelines for the household data collection and guidelines for the distribution of KKB cards that was issued by BPS and aimed at local government officials was also not properly distributed
In addition, several SLT-related documents from the central government that could actually provide the legal basis for local governments, such as Inpres, decrees from the Coordinating Minister of Peoples' Welfare (Menko Kesra) and the Minister of Home Affairs, were late in arriving or, in fact, were not received
Not only was the socialization of the program weak but also the socialization of the name of the program itself
The program has different designations, namely the Direct Cash Transfer (SLT) or Cash Transfer Assistance (BLT)
This was due to the difference in designation at the central government level which was set out in several policies that provided the basis for the program
Inpres No
12 of 2005 referred to it as BLT, while several ministerial documents and operational guidelines refer to it as SLT
This certainly caused confusion for various parties
Nevertheless, at the community level this program was better known as BBM Compensation
On one hand, the minimal level of socialization in the data collection phase can reduce moral hazard in target determination
On the other hand, however, the lack of a comprehensive socialization of the program gave rise to misperceptions and social jealousies
4.4
Complaints and Problem Resolution The occurence of mistargeting, although small, that was worsened by the inadequacy of the program socialization, especially in regard to the target criteria and program objectives, has triggered community dissatisfaction
Community dissatisfaction was expressed in various forms starting with complaints, protests or demonstrations, making threats against officials to destruction of tools
In Cianjur, the community took protest action by going to the houses of the RT head and enumerators, as well as the village office
There were also cases of the destruction of the houses of the village and hamlet heads
In Demak, protest actions were made in one kecamatan office by mobilizing the community in three trucks
In Bima, the village office was sealed off for two days
In Tapanuli Tengah, protest action in one village caused the delay in the distribution of KKB cards on three occasions
In addition, the past conflict such as that occurred in Bima and Tapanuli Tengah worsened the conflict
The post-reformasi condition following the implementation of village and regional autonomy, resulted in the village community being unafraid in putting forth their opinions, which occasionally took the form of protest actions
It was strongly assumed that the scale of the protest action was more of a result of local politics rather than technical problems related to the implementation of the SLT program
In Tapanuli Tengah, apart from the history of conflict in the past nomination of the village head, the plan for regional head election to be held on 11 December 2005 also increased the potential for conflict in the community
In several areas, the damage to the socio-political order of the local community was considered bigger than the advantage that was received by the poor through the SLT Program
In the sample villages where the implementation of the SLT was assessed as good, community protests were still occuring although they could then be appropriately resolved
In the resolution of problems that emerged in the community, the village head had an important role
Quite a few, however, involved the security apparatus such as the police or local military post in the kecamatan
Good coordination between BPS and local government also provided satisfactory results in reducing conflict in several regions
The means of conflict resolution varied, including
1) Giving a direct explanation to the community of the criteria for SLT recipient households
BPS accompanied by Asda (Assistant Regional Secretary), camat and village heads visited villagers to explain the SLT program
The initiative of one RT in this village to ask BPS to explain the criteria for SLT recipients proved helpful in mitigating conflict that occurred
2) The willingness of SLT recipients to share some of the funds they received with other poor households
In several RT in Demak, SLT recipients set aside between Rp25,000-Rp100,000, while in Cianjur an average of Rp50,000 was set aside
In Tapanuli Tengah, adat leaders consensually requested recipients to set aside Rp50,000, but these funds were considered loans that would be returned if these households obtained supplementary SLT payments in the second phase
3) The opening of a supplementary registration for households who felt entitled
In practice, the registration was not only undertaken directly by the relevant household
There were households that didn't register but were registered by the RT head, enumerator, neighbor or village head
The registered unit was also not always the household as there were also individuals or families
As a consequence there was high increase in the number of supplementary registrations, as was covered in the previous section on targeting
4) There were officials who promised that supplementary registrants would recieve the SLT in the next phase
This promise, although in the short-term was able to reduce conflict, in the long-term there is a concern that it could, in fact, give rise to new and broader problems
To anticipate complaints and at the same time to monitor the program implementation, the government issued the Minister of Home Affairs Directive No
541/2475/SJ and the Coordinating Minister for Peoples' Welfare Directive No
B.244/Menko/Kesra/IX/2005 that requested regional governments to establish a coordinating post (posko) for complaints and monitoring, the funding allocation of which was added to the APBD
In its implementation, the SLT posko was only found in Demak and Ternate, and it was only limited at the kabupaten/kota level
The existence of posko and the available complaints mechanism was also not broadly disseminated to the community, so there were variations in the complaints channels
For the SLT Monitoring and Complaints Posko in Demak, the regional government appointed the Community Empowerment Office (Kapermas) as the coordinator of the PKPS BBM (Compensation Program for Reduced Subsidies on Refined Fuel Oil) complaints post, including the SLT program
In its implementation, the posko only accepted complaints in the form of the submission of suggestions for new SLT recipients
The submission mechanism also did not involve Kapermas directly, because the suggestions of new targets were, in general, submitted directly to the BPS office, and Kapermas was only given a copy as the report
In Ternate, the PKPS BBM Monitoring and Complaints Team was formed on 1 October 2005
The team was better known as the Complaints and Monitoring Posko, headed by the Sekda of Kota Ternate whose membership consisted of the head or section head of various agencies, including the post office and BPS
This Posko was only formed at the kota level, while there were none at the village and kecamatan level
Although poskos were formed, the socialization on the existence of the posko was only conducted at the village level so the utilization of the posko by the community was not maximized
Many community complaints were sent directly to BPS with or without a copy to the posko
Meanwhile, although the Tapanuli Tengah district had a PKPS BBM Monitoring and Community Complaints Coordination Team that covered nine programs, the SLT program was not included
So, if the community was not satisfied with the SLT program, they went directly to the village head, lorong head, enumerator or BPS
Like Tapanuli Tengah, in Cianjur the complaints posko at the level of the kabupaten, kecamatan, and village was the complaints post for the BBM compensation program that was given the name Community Complaints Unit (UPM)
Because there was no clear complaints mechanism, the community members who felt dissatisfied with the SLT program complained to the RT, RW or hamlet head, village head or officials, enumerators, KSK or BPS
Meanwhile, the complaints in the BIMA district, both oral and written, were distributed to various agencies, including BPS, post office, police, Bappeda, and DPRD
To anticipate the emergence and spread of community discord, during the BPS national technical meeting, the participation of the police in providing security was stressed again, including protecting authorities and applying sanctions to offending officials and people
In West Java and Central Java, the local police published a circular that contained provisions on the criminal sanctions for those making false documents or papers on poor households
4.5
Institutional Issues The weakness of coordination and communication in the implementation of the SLT program was the main problem faced by officials at the kabupaten/kota level
This can be seen, among other reasons, by the fact that various official documents on the SLT operation issued by the central government was late in arriving, or even not received by kabupaten/kota governments
Inpres No
12 of 2005 on the Implementation of the SLT for Poor Households that was issued on 10 September 2005 provided the first legal basis for the SLT program
Via this Inpres, the president, inter alia, instructed Bappenas to coordinate the planning preparation and the organizations implementing the program
The president also instructed governors, district heads, and mayors along with their officials to provide support and supervision for the program implementation
In the meantime, the data collection activity on poor households had already been started one month earlier by BPS (on 15 August 2005)
In practice, the Inpres document and other documents on the SLT program were only received by local governments when the SLT funds were beng disbursed to recipients
Local government, therefore, felt that they were not being involved officially in the SLT program from early on
The data collection by BPS on poor families/households, according to many regional officials, was conducted without coordination with local government
This might have been caused by BPS officials' perception that data collection was just a routine activity
This process created the impression in the regions that the SLT program was centralized and implemented by institutions that were also centralized (BPS and PT Pos Indonesia)
On one hand, local government supported the central government effort to reduce poverty in their region
On the other hand, local government questioned the central government's commitment to the implementation of political decentralization and regional autonomy
The organizing of the data collection and determination of poor families/households by BPS as a central agency that tended to lack transparency added to the impression of centralization in the management of the SLT program
This non-transparent process was also considered to be in contradiction with the democratization process which was being developed
In this regard, there was indeed conflict between the law that prevents BPS from publicizing respondents' identities (Law No
16 of 1997) with the democratic need to consult on the proposed SLT recipients with the local public
In addition, inaccuracy in interpreting Inpres No
12 of 2005 during the conduct of the coordinating meeting at the ministerial level in the Peoples' Welfare portfolio (16 September 2005) also impacted on the optimization of the role of the Ministry for Home Affairs
The duty of the Ministry for Home Affairs as implementation and supervision coordinator was interpreted as being supervision and handling of complaints
For that reason, one function of local government as the instrument of the Ministry for Home Affairs to coordinate the implementation of the SLT program was not undertaken
Thus, when the results of the poor family/household data collection gave rise to sociopolitical unrest in various regions, the central government then seriously requested local governments to take “security” steps
Two documents that were issued by the central government, namely
1) the decree of the Minister for Home Affairs No
541/2475/SJ dated 26 September 2005 concerning the Technical Guidelines for the Administration of Community Complaint Resolution and Monitoring the SLT for Poor Families for 2005, and 2) the decree of the Coordinating Minister for Peoples' Welfare No
B.244/Menko/Kesra/IX/2005 dated 28 September 2005 on the Establishment of Complaints Posts
The Directive of the Coordinating Minister for Peoples' Welfare, requested, inter alia, that governors, district heads, mayors, subdistrict heads and village heads, within two days, establish a community complaint post in their respective regions
Therefore, the local governments were positioned as trouble-shooters
Nevertheless, the SLT recipient community liked the simplicity of the SLT program management bureaucracy, which was assigned to BPS and the post office and was the sole key to the efficiency of the program administration
The problems that then often arose were due to the fact that these two agencies' employees are used to working within a technical paradigm
Meanwhile, poverty is a multidimensional problem and requires a comprehensive social, economic and political approach
4.6
Level of Satisfaction and Program Output 4.6.1
Level of Satisfaction To understand the extent of the level of satisfaction of stakeholders with the SLT program, focus group discusssions (FGD) were undertaken with community groups that represented SLT recipients and village and kabupaten/kota officials and leaders
The aspects that were observed included determination and accuracy of targeting, socialization, card distribution, funds disbursement, problem handling and institutional issues
Approximately 6-10 FGD participants from each group were asked their opinions about these aspects by using a score between 10-100
The higher the score they gave, the higher the level of satisfaction
The results of this FGD are presented in Diagram 1
In general, the level of satisfaction of the SLT recipient community was higher than the level of satisfaction of village and kabupaten/kota leaders and officials
This is understandable because it is the recipients who benefit most from the SLT program
Meanwhile, the level of satisfaction of village leaders and officials was the lowest
This is understandable because they were the ones who most negatively affected by problems in the administration of the SLT program
In the view of SLT recipients, the factor that was felt to be most unsatisfactory was the lack of socialization, especially information on the criteria for recipient households
The complaint handling issue was also considered still unsatisfactory
Meanwhile, the issue of targeting accuracy or determination was assessed as good and quite satisfactory
It was also the same with the distribution of cards, funds disbursement, and the amount of the SLT funds
On the other hand, the level of satisfaction of village authorities/officials tended to be lower than the level of satisfaction of those at the kabupaten/kota level, with the exception of the distribution of KKB cards
These two groups considered the KKB distribution and funds disbursement as the most satisfying aspects
The socialization program and institutionalization were considered most unsatisfactory
This study also tried to uncover the same information from non-recipient households through in-depth interviews
In general, non-recipient respondents' level of satisfaction was not that much different from the SLT recipients
They were of the opinion that the socialization was the weakest, while the determination process and targeting accuracy, and problem handling was considered to be quite good
Nevertheless, they also viewed that there were a small number of poor households like themselves that did not receive the SLT
On the other hand, there were also a few recipient households that they considered unsuitable
4.6.2
Impact of the Program There were glaring differences of opinion between government officials, SLT recipient households and the community in general on the impact of the SLT
Community officials/leaders Community leaders and officials, in general, were in less agreement with this program because they considered it to be a “program that only provided fish rather than a fish-hook”
They were concerned that this assistance would make the community become indolent
This program was also considered counter-productive to other programs that were more in the nature of community empowerment
They suggested this program not be provided over the long-term, but that a one-year program was sufficent
In the future, the program should not create the impression that it is “giving out money for free” or “handing out money”, but rather these programs should be in the form of community empowerment programs, infrastructure development or those that provide employment opportunities
There were also community officials and leaders who viewed that this program would be very good if it was accurately targeted
Through this program, the poor could be assisted in covering their daily needs that are becoming increasingly expensive
SLT program recipients SLT recipients were very grateful for the SLT program because the funds they received could be utilized in accordance with their needs
This was especially so when the disbursement coincided with Ramadan when there are usually a lot of additional costs to be met
They considered that the program did not have an impact on their work ethic in fulfilling basic family needs
They admitted that this amount of money could not be used for new business capital, but only to fulfill consumption needs, children's school fees, medical treatment, and additional business capital
One SLT recipient said that
“This is the first time since the Dutch and Japanese colonial period that the government has provided direct monetary assistance to its people.” One other person said that
“This is the only program where the poor can fully enjoy the benefit because in other programs, the village elites and officials always intervened.” Some recipients objected to the suggestion to replace the SLT program with intensive work programs
They saw that intensive work programs reduced the possibility of the aged or disabled poor from becoming recipients
In addition, it would be difficult for fishers and farmers to join this program
The positive impact of this program was an enhanced awareness of possessing a KTP, although as a result of compulsion
This is because in some regions, the collection of the SLT funds required accompanying forms of proof, such as KTP or identification papers from the village head
Village officials Almost all village officials said that they were negatively affected by the SLT program
The RT heads or lorong/hamlet heads felt that they were not appreciated by residents who did not receive the SLT because these families felt that their condition was ignored
In several villages, it became increasingly difficult to request residents to engage in mutual assistance activities and the reception of village tax levies was affected
In addition, the various threats made against village and data collection officials created strain among many village officials and data collectors
Some of them resigned from their positions
In fact, all village heads in Kecamatan Cibeber, Cianjur, planned to resign if the supplementary SLT recipients were not approved because they were concerned for their safety
General community Social jealousies appeared in the community
The community became reluctant to pay their zakat (community tithe) and their pancen (levy for paying the wages of village officials) and Building and Land Tax (PBB)
It was considered that the SLT program could cause dependency and moral hazard because the community would always expect to be given assistance
This concern is supported by the number of people who applied for the second phase of the data collection, although many of them were actually relatively well-off
The presence of this program encourged other groups working on similiar program, such as the Regional Poverty Reduction Committee (KPKD) and NGOs to enhance cooperation and exchange information on poverty data in the region
4.6.3
Monitoring Program In the five research locations, there did not appear to be any comprehensive monitoring activity
Monitoring activity was only partial in nature, connected with the interests of each implementing agency, namely BPS and the post office
The monitoring initiative by local government began to be undertaken in some districts
It was aimed more at observing conflict that arose and planning efforts to overcome it
In one kecamatan in Cianjur, for example, the camat had distributed forms to collect information about the development of the SLT program and the problems that arose
At the national level, for monitoring purposes, the office of the Coordinating Minister for Peoples' Welfare in cooperation with a number of university research institutions conducted research on the SLT program at the kabupaten/kota level
This activity was undertaken almost simultaneously with the conduct of this study
RECOMMENDATIONS 1
BPS and the post office should continue as the main SLT managers in the field
It is suggested that these two institutions, in addition to being responsible to their superior agencies, also be responsible to the bupati/mayor in each of their working area or report their activities to the bupati/mayor
2
The Ministry of Home Affairs needs to assign kabupaten/kota governments to coordinate all implementation and supervision activities for the SLT in accordance with Inpres No 12 of 2005
In undertaking this duty, the local government should immediately establish an integrated posko at all levels of government (kabupaten/kota, kecamatan, and village) that involves BPS, the post office and the police
3
The duty of local government to be implemented within the framework of the routine activities of regional government administration
The operational costs of implementation is to be borne by the APBD, particularly for poor regions it is to be provided via special allocation funds (DAK)
4
It should be clear whether the concept of poor family or poor household will be used
At the least, in the same district, a uniform concept should be used
5
KKB cards for households that are not suitable recipients have to be immediately cancelled by the posko
For households that refuse cancellation, their funds can be blocked at the post office
6
Cancelled KKB cards should be immediately delivered to the kabupaten/kota BPS and the post office informed in order to avoid funding misuse or disbursement by people who have no entitlement
7
The posko should immediately undertake verification and research of supplementary household recipients
The verification and research should be done from house to house
If there is insufficient time, this can be done via a community consultation (musyawarah) at the village level
8
The distribution of KKB cards to supplementary household recipients by the posko has to be in accordance with the KKB distribution guidelines from BPS
9
The names of SLT household recipients, including the results of the supplementary data collection, need to be published in public places at the SLS level
To validate the accuracy of targeting, the community should be given the opportunity to submit their objections to the closest posko within a certain timeframe
10
To improve the system of coordination and communication, the central government has to ensure that all documents that it issues are received by each kabupaten/kota government administration
11
The central government has to support the implementation of program socialization for the community using various channels, namely regional government, various print and electronic media and the wide-scale distribution of more informative and communicative brochures
The socialization material should especially emphasize the program aims, criteria for program recipients, and the availability and function of coordinating posts
12
The post office needs to prepare a complete and clear SLT funds distribution schedule for each village
Information on the place and schedule for distribution should be publicized to recipients through various means, for example through village officials or announcements in places of religious worship
13
The post office needs to be flexible in distributing the funds, for example by providing mobile posts or opening service posts at the village level
14
Consideration needs to be given to introducing a requirement for identification such as a KTP when funds are disbursed
This is to minimize funding digressions such as the collection of funds by those with no entitlement or the buying and selling of KKB cards
This needs to be supported by a policy on the production of identity cards (KTP) that is easy, cheap or free
15
There needs to be clear law enforcement for every form of program violation, such as the falsification of information and levies on recipients
The issuing of sanctions and their dissemination will have the effect of dissuading the community and other authorities from commiting such violations
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In March and October 2005, the Government of Indonesia reduced fuel subsidy and allocated part of the funds to the BOS (Bantuan Operasional Sekolah-School Operational Assistance) Program, which commenced in July 2005
This program is provided for schools at the primary and junior high school levels and is intended to reduce the burden on the community, especially the poor, of the costs of education after the BBM (fuel) price rose
Different from the previous PKPS-BBM that had been provided in the form of BKM scholarships for students from poor family background, BOS was provided for schools
BOS funds were allocated on the basis of the number of students, with an amount of Rp235,000 per student per annum at the primary school (SD) level and Rp324,500 per student per annum at the junior high school (SMP) level
The APBN allocation to BOS funds for the period of July–December 2005 was Rp5.136 trillion, or an approximate eightfold increase over the BKM budget for primary and junior high schools in the period of January-June 2005
This report was written on the basis of a rapid appraisal by The SMERU Research Institute in an effort to understand the implementation of BOS Program
The study was conducted between February and May 2006
The fieldwork was conducted over approximately three weeks between February and March 2006 in ten samples of kabupaten/kota distributed across five provinces, namely Kabupaten North Tapanuli and Kota Pematang Siantar in North Sumatra, Kabupaten Lebak and Kota Cilegon in Banten, Kabupaten Malang and Kota Pasuruan in East Java, Kabupaten North Minahasa and Kota Manado in North Sulawesi, and Kabupaten Central Lombok and Kota Mataram in West Nusa Tenggara (NTB)
This study adopts a qualitative approach
The collection of data and information was undertaken through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions (FGD)
Interviews were conducted with various implementing institutions at the central, provincial, kabupaten/kota and school levels, including with school committees, teachers and students' parents
FGDs were held in all 10 samples of kabupaten/kota and divided into two parts, namely FGDs with stakeholders in the field of education at the kabupaten/kota level, and FGDs with several school principals and school committees
Supporting information was also collected through interviews with other institutions that took part in monitoring the implementation of BOS Program
A summary of the findings of the study on the implementation of BOS Program in the first semester of 2005/2006 is as follows
1
Targeting, Data Collection, and Allocations In general, the BOS Program tended to be implemented as a general subsidy
This was because BOS Program had a broad and equitable coverage, regarding both the numbers of schools and students
There were only a small number of schools that refused BOS funds, many of which were well-off schools
The decision to reject BOS Program was taken unilaterally by the school management, without consulting with the students' parents
The students who were targeted to benefit from BOS Program were those coming from both poor and non-poor family backgrounds
Therefore, many parties considered BOS Program as beneficial for the poor, although only a few schools provided special assistance for poor students
The data collection system that was conducted early in the implementation of the program was less than satisfactory, especially because of the weakness in the previous education information system and the limited time for program preparation, which made it impossible to undertake an adequate data collection
The weakness in the data collection process caused a gap between the data on the number of students that was used to determine allocations and the actual number of students
Nevertheless, the flexibility and authority provided for the provincial satker (working unit) to adjust the size of funds allocations for the kabupaten/kota and schools in their areas appeared to have been very effective for a better distribution of funds
In regard to the allocation of funds, this study captured several criticisms concerning the formula used
The formula for the determination of allocations was considered unfair for schools which had few students, had a lot of teachers paid by honorarium, had many poor students, and were located in isolated places
The allocation formula based on the number of students was also considered as unsuitable for the application in salafiyah (a traditional type of Islamic schools) because the educational practices in salafiyah are informal and not binding in nature, so their number of students fluctuates
2
Socialization The program's socialization activities both for the whole range of implementers and for the community were considered weak
The weakness was caused, inter alia, by the lateness of the socialization, the limited time, the material that was too general, the material and tools that were incomplete, the big number of participants in each activity, and the implementation of the activity that tended to be just for formality
In several cases, this weakness was worsened by the limitation of funds, especially for large regions
As a result, many program implementers had insufficient understanding of the operational and technical guidelines, and there were differences in interpretating the contents of these guidelines amongst implementers
This had in turn confused the implementers at the lower level
The inconsistencies between the explanations that were given to the program implementers and the explanations that were disseminated through the mass media and other non-implementing parties to the general public, particularly on the release of students from education costs, also confused the community and tended to cause misunderstandings between schools and the students' parents
3
Channeling of Funds In general, the channeling of funds was undertaken in accordance with the flow chart that was determined in the operational guideline
The policy of channeling BOS funds directly to school accounts was assessed as quite appropriate because, in general, the channeling proceeded smoothly and the funds were received in their entirety
The lateness of the funds distribution, especially in second semester of the 2005-2006 academic year, made it difficult for many schools to fulfill their operational needs and resulted in delays in the payment of teachers' honorarium, or it forced them to make loan to various parties
Furthermore, there were differences in the channeling mechanism for BOS funds, the means of appointing channeling institutions, and other policies regarding school bank accounts that eventually impacted on the disbursement of the funds
In most provinces, the appointment of channeling institutions was not done in a transparent way
In several provinces, the appointment of the institutions and the restrictions on the place where school accounts could be kept did not take into consideration the ease of service and the schools' accessibility
These tended to add on the costs and time of the schools when withdrawing the funds
4
Absorption and Utilization of Funds At the time this study was conducted, most (almost 99%) of BOS funds for the July- December 2005 period had already been received by the schools
The remaining funds (1%) kept in the account of the provincial satker originated from the excess allocation in several BOS recipient schools and from the funds that had not been collected by the non-participating schools
There were several problems in the management of BOS funds at school level in connection with the capacity of the schools in preparing the RAPBS (school budget), the control over the withdrawal of funds from the school's account and the usage of the funds
In many schools, the school principal was very dominant in deciding the use of the BOS funds and in the preparation of the RAPBS
In several provinces, the satker imposed additional requirements for the withdrawal of funds from the school's bank account, with the rationale of the need for supervision
These requirements added procedural bureaucracy to schools in the withdrawal of BOS funds
In addition, many schools faced the problem of a lack of clarity on the stipulation concerning savings interest and the complexity of the procedures for the tax payment on the use of the BOS funds
The assessments made by various parties on the 11 types of funds utilization stipulated in the 2005 operational guidelines varied
However, in general many considered these stipulations were too restrictive (limiting) because they do not accommodate all the needs of the schools
For that reason, the realization of the use of BOS funds was not always consistent with the RAPBS and the 11 types of uses
Based on the accountability reports of BOS funds made by the sample schools, the largest part of the funds was used for paying teachers' honorarium, teaching and learning activities, and the purchase of office stationery and core textbooks
5
Reporting At the time of this study, the reports that had been completed were
the report on assistance recipients, particularly on the allocation of funds and the data on the number of students as well as the number of schools receiving BOS assistance; and the report on the program preparation that covered socialization activities
The report on the monitoring and evaluation outcomes and the report on the funds utilization from the kabupaten/kota to the province had not been available yet
The reporting on the usage of the funds should have been undertaken in steps from schools to the Kabupaten/Kota satker and the recap should be submitted to the provincial satker
For madrasah (Islamic schools), the report should to be sent to the Kabupaten/Kota satker and to the Kabupaten/Kota office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs
This was seen as reducing the significance of the joint-management approach agreed to be adopted by the education offices and the offices of the Ministry of Religious Affairs in managing the program
In general, schools experienced difficulty in preparing the financial accountability report because of their limited capabilities and facilities as well as the intricacy in adjusting financial statements so that the type of expenditure can be in accordance with the operational guidelines
In almost all schools the accountability report was only submitted to the kabupaten/kota satker without being distributed to the students' parents, that disregarded the element of transparency and public accountability
6
Monitoring, Evaluation, and Handling of Complaints In general, there were several weaknesses in the existing monitoring and evaluation (monev) system that had been constructed to safeguard BOS Program
The quality of the implementation of the internal monev is still in question and gives an impression of being implemented as a formality only, while the external monev was too open, allowing too many parties, including the ones who were incompetent and irresponsible, to undertake it
In addition, a system that can synergize external and internal monev so that the outcomes can effectively safeguard the program's implementation and provide inputs for sustainable program improvement has not been developed yet
Many parties question the effectiveness of the internal and external monev activities because of the minimal feedback for a better implementation of the program
In fact, in several regions, some irresponsible parties abused the monev activities for personal benefit
The weaknesses in the monev system also resulted in flaws in the complaints handling system that was part of the roles of the internal and external monev
The system for receiving and handling of complaints was still not well organized, although many parties already took part on it
The ineffective complaints handling system was caused, inter alia, by the lack of socialization regarding the complaints channel, the potential conflicts of interests as the internal monev is attached to the satker, and the difficulty of accessing available telephone and email facilities
As a consequence, only a few complaints regarding the implementation of BOS Program were received
The cases of suspected deviations on program implementation were more often disclosed by the local media and NGOs with no guarantee of follow-ups
Apart from the satker unit, the handling of complaints in several regions also received the attention of other institutions, such as the local legislature (DPRD) and the regional inspectorate board (Bawasda)
In general, their resolution was handeled by the institutions where the case was reported
However, both the complaint and the follow up process were not well documented in writing
The form for complaint documentation was not used
7
Institutional Affairs The implementation of the joint-management principle seemed to be forcefully imposed
The autonomous status of education affairs (public schools) and the vertical status of religious affairs (madrasah and salafiyah) cause disharmony in institutional relationships and less effective implementation of joint-management
The problems that arise include, inter alia, lack of coordination, complaints about unequal distribution of roles and responsibilities, as well as complaints about the management of funds for socialization and monev
The structure of the satker that was formed without considering the personnel's competence and the difference in the number of schools and madrasah made the distribution of work to the satker personnel, who came from two different institutions, difficult
Education institutions tended to dominate the program management, which involving institutions at the kecamatan level (UPTD) in its implementation, especially in the kabupaten area
The UPTD had a role as an intermediary between schools and satker as well as assisting schools in implementing the program
The important role of the UPTD was not, however, supported with an adequate understanding of the program, and this unit was not institutionally included within the satker structure
In general, school committees were not yet functioning as a partner of the school in managing BOS
The school committee only had a role in signing the RAPBS to fulfill the requirement for receiving BOS funds
The education councils, in general, were also just playing the role as the “stamp” of the satker
The education councils tended to be elitist in nature and in only a few regions did the councils give sufficient attention to the issues that occured in schools and school committees
8
The Impact of and Level of Satisfaction with the Program Implementation In general, BOS Program increased school revenues, making it possible for the improvements of teaching and learning activities in the school and the increase in community access, including the poor, to education
With BOS funds, schools could, among other things, increase
the availability of educational tools and infrastructure, teachers' incomes (teachers paid by honorarium, contract teachers and permanent teachers), the quality and quantity of extra-curricular activities, the frequency of additional lessons, and the quality of teachers
The administration of the program's implementation, however, consumed too much of the time and attention of the school principal, whose role is very crucial in the management of teaching and learning activities, giving rise to a concern that it would have a negative impact on teaching and learning activities
Although quantitative data is not yet available, the results of qualitative analysis through interviews and FGDs provide indications of a positive impact of BOS Program on the participation in education, except in regard to the decrease in dropouts in junior high schools
There are indications that BOS Program increased the motivation to study for students from poor families because they are no longer concerned about arrears in student tuition and they are better equiped with education tools
The benefits of BOS Program for preventing dropouts especially in junior high schools, however, appeared to be small because most parents whose children had dropped out, some of which have just dropped out of school in the 2005-2006 academic year, did not know of the existence of BOS Program in their child's school
Schools are also unaware that BOS Program is aimed at preventing dropouts because this was not sufficiently stressed in the socialization or in the agreement on the receipt of assistance
The problem of dropouts in junior high schools is not only caused by economic incapacity, but also by other factors such as student delinquency and the interest in getting a job
On the one hand, the reduction or even the exemption from tuition fee can be considered to be a positive impact that is consistent with the program's objectives
On the other hand, a concern arose that this assistance would instead reduce the selfreliance of the community and decrease the participation of various other parties in education funding
The response of regional governments to BOS Program varied because various factors influence the changes in the education budget allocation
Of the ten samples of kabupaten/kota visited in this study, it appears that only two cities tended to reduce their budget allocation for education after the introduction of BOS
Indeed, the existence of BOS Program impacted the local governments planning for education sector programs, and quite a lot of regions have planned and conducted programs that will indirectly support the effectiveness of BOS, such as the provision of incentives for permanent teachers and capacity building for school management
Through FGDs (N=20), various stakeholders in the education sector and schools in general evaluated the implementation of the program as less than satisfactory
Average score for the seven phases in the range of 5.4–6.6 (0=very unsatisfactory, 10=very satisfactory)
Of the various phases of the implementation of BOS Program, the socialization component was, in general, considered most unsatisfactory, followed by complaints handling, funds channeling, as well as reporting and monev
Meanwhile, in the in-depth interviews, most parents stated they were quite satisfied because they enjoy a reduction in school costs
most parents whose children had received BKM tended to prefer BOS Program
RECOMMENDATIONS In general, this rapid appraisal show that BOS Program was very helpful in supporting the implementation of teaching and learning activities in schools, and, within certain limits, reduced the cost burden of education that is borne by the parents of students
Considering the benefits that had already accrued and the potential benefits of the program in the future, it is suggested that BOS Program be continued with various conceptual and technical refinements so that the benefits of the program can be optimized
This study also revealed the strategic position of schools as the spearhead of the program's implementation; capacity building in school institutions, both in the areas of administration and internal control mechanisms (checks and balances), will certainly determine the effectiveness of the program
The BOS Program in its current operation tends to be ambivalent in determining whether the program should be aimed at providing general subsidies or subsidies to poor students only
The decision is more often up to the schools, resulting in confusion
For that reason, there is a need for a political courage to clarify the position of BOS Program in the education financing
If the program is aimed at general subsidies in the context of fulfilling the right of all citizens to receive decent standard of education, it is recommended that BOS Program be positioned as assistance from the government for the implementation of a minimum level of education service
If, however, the program is aimed at providing subsidies for poor students, the program should adopt a clearer targeting mechanism, through the targeting of regions and schools or through individual targeting
If it is undertaken through individual targeting, the selection should not only be done by schools, but also by special independent officials as is done with the provision of conditional subsidies
In such programs, poor families are given a card to obtain free education and schools will bill the government to provide a service to these students
In regard to the program management mechanism, considering the limitations, both in the quality of the data collection and the capability of the program management at all levels, the deconcentration mechanism was quite appropriate
In the medium term, however, deliberation and preparation are needed for diverting the management mechanism from deconcentration to special allocation funds (DAK) so that the regions can manage the program and, at the same time, have the obligation to provide real contribution to the program implementation
In this regard, consideration also needs to be given to the decentralization of madrasah affairs so that the regions will give the same level of attention to madrasah as to other schools, although the Ministry of Religious Affairs can still provide special assistance
In addition, three main issues need to be refined in the technical implementation of the program
1
Unified perceptions on the objectives and targets of the program that will be the basis for the implementation of the program, starting from the socialization phase, the implementation, to the monitoring and evaluation
In order to avoid confusion in the community and among the program implementers, the objectives and targets of the program have to be presented clearly, without any intervention from other parties that arise for political reasons
There are two issues that need to be stressed, namely
(i) BOS Program will only fulfill the minimum service of education, so in order to increase the quality of education, the participation and contribution of the community should not be eliminated; and (ii) the main target of the program is to absolve the poor of the costs of education so that they do not drop out of school
2
The existence of a data collection system which becomes the basis for determining the allocation of funds to schools
There is a need for a system that includes standard data that will be used as the basis for calculating allocations, the data collection mechanism and the mechanism to adjust to the latest data so the difference between the allocations and the real needs can be minimized
It is recommended that the data on students in the month of August be used because the number of students in that particular month is relatively stable
This data collection system also has to guarantee the accuracy and transparency of the data
3
A reporting, monitoring and evaluation system that guarantees broader public accountability
The existing reporting mechanism to the kabupaten/kota, provincial and Central Satker needs to be supplemented with a reporting system to the public through a simple medium available in schools, such as presenting the accountability report to the school committee and attaching a summary of the school financial plan and report in the vicinity of the school
In regard to the monev, it is necessary to reregulate the system so external monev can be conducted more effectively and efficiently, without disturbing the teaching and learning activities at schools
I
INTRODUCTION 1.1 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES In March and October 2005, the Government of Indonesia reduced the fuel subsidy and re-allocated most of the funds to four large programs that were designed to reduce the community's burden, especially the poor, resulting from the rise in the fuel price
These four programs are those in the education, health, and rural infrastructure sectors, and for direct (unconditional) cash transfers
The education sector program that received a large budget allocation is the BOS (School Operational Assistance) Program
Through this program, the central government provided funds to schools at the primary (SD) and junior high school (SMP) levels that were willing to meet the conditions determined in the requirements for program participants
Schools included in this program were SD/MI/SDLB/salafiyah at the primary level and SMP/MTS/SMPLB/salafiyah at the junior high school level, both public and private.
This program started in July 2005 at the same time as the commencement of the 2005/2006 academic year
The BOS Program is conceptually different from the previous education sector compensation programs for reduced fuel subsidies (PKPS-BBM)
Until the 2004/2005 academic year, the PKPS-BBM Education Sector Program for primary and junior high schools was given in the form of scholarships for poor students, known as BKM (Special Assistance for Students) Program
The number of poor students who received BKM was determined by the central government based on the poverty index
In the 2004-2005 academic year, BKM was provided to approximately 20% of primary school students and 24% of junior high school students, with a scholarship value of Rp60,000 per semester per primary school student and Rp120,000 per semester per junior high student
Each school received a particular quota and undertook the selection of students who were eligible recipients
The BKM funds were then disbursed directly to the selected student via an appointed post office
The BOS Program adopted a different approach than the BKM Program in the sense that the funds were not provided directly to the poor students but were granted for and managed by schools
The amount of BOS funds for each school was calculated based on the number of students in each respective school
Consequently, the number of students covered by the PKPS-BBM Education Program in primary and junior high schools rose almost five times and the budget for the program also increased approximately eightfold (Table 1.1)
Because of this conceptual change as well as the large increase in the volume of funds that were allocated from the central government budget to BOS Program, it is necessary to examine the field implementation of the program
Many parties who were directly involved in the planning and preparation of BOS Program acknowledged that this large program was prepared in a very short time frame
For that reason, an in-depth observation of the problems and obstacles faced during the first semester of the program's implementation would be necessary for future program improvement
In an effort to examine the implementation of BOS Program during the first semester of the 2005-2006 academic year, as lessons learned for the planning and improvement of the program's management in the future, the SMERU Research Institute with the support of the World Bank undertook a rapid appraisal in 10 kabupaten/kota located in five provinces
In general, this rapid appraisal focused on examining the planning and implementation of the program, both at the central and regional levels
In particular, the study at the central level was directed towards looking at
1) The framework of and regulations on the implementation of the program, which are how the program's implementation was regulated, what were the differences compared to previous programs and what was the framework of the program's implementation; 
2) The socialization and transparency of information, which are what was the understanding of the related institutions on the program stipulation and the implementation framework, the suitability of the schools participating in the program, and the program monitoring and evaluation; 
3) What was the coverage of the program or the percentage of schools that received BOS; 
4) How much funding was transferred, and to where (region, type of schools) were these funds channeled
The study of the program implementation in the field was directed towards examining
1) The socialization and transparency of information, including
What is the understanding of the community, regional government, and schools about the program
Is this understanding in line with the program design
2) Why did the schools decide to accept or reject BOS Program
3) Leakage
Is the amount of funds received by schools the same as that recorded at the central government level
4) Funding utilization
How did schools use the funds
Was this usage in accordance with the guidance set out in the operational guidelines for the program
If not, why
5) Financial transparency
Were the BOS funds included in the school's budget (RAPBS)
Did the school committee know of the existence of the BOS funds
Did the school committee participate in deciding the use of these funds
6) What problems arose in the program implementation and why did these problems arise
7) Future steps
How should the program be refined according to the opinion of the community, regional governments,and schools
Finally, this appraisal aimed at providing recommendations on improvements to the design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation of the program
1.2 GENERAL OVERVIEW OF BOS PROGRAM The BOS Program was initiated against the backdrop of the concerns that the increase in the fuel price, which caused a decline in the community's purchasing power, would also have a negative impact on the poor's access to education as well as impeding the achievement of the Nine-year Compulsory Basic Education (Wajardikdas) Program
At the same time, Law No
20 of 2003 on the National Education System, section 5, paragraph (1) stated that “Every citizen has an equal right to receive a quality education,” 
and section 11, paragraph (1) states “The central government and regional governments are required to provide service and easy access, as well as guarantee the implementation of quality education for each citizen without discrimination.” 
Within this context, BOS Program was initiated, in principle, as a way to enhance community access, especially for students from poor or less well-off families to a quality education in the framework of facilitating the achievement of the nine-year compulsory basic education
In the program planning, however, there was a duality of views on the main objective of BOS Program
On the one hand, there was a view that the program aimed to provide free schooling for all children attending primary and junior high schools because all people had an equal right to education
On the other hand, there was a view that this program was aimed at providing subsidies to poor students, because they had less access to education
This difference in view was reflected in the program objectives that were written in the 2005 Operational Guidelines Book and in the 2006 Guide Book, as it is quoted in Box 1.1
The emphasis on the priority for poor students was not explicitly mentioned in the program objectives contained in the 2005 version of the Operational Guidelines Book, although it was stated that in the implementation of the program, poor students had to receive greater priority to be released from school tuition
A more explicit statement on the priority for poor students was stated in the 2006 Guide Book that was a refinement of the 2005 version based on the inputs from various parties
Through BOS Program, the central government provided block grant to schools
Schools could use these funds for the school's operational needs, especially for non-personnel operational costs in accordance with the regulations that had been established in the program guidelines (Table 1.2)
The amount of funds to be received by schools was estimated on the basis of the number of students, with an allocation of Rp235,000 per student per annum for primary schools and Rp324,500 per student per annum for junior high schools
This allocation per student was determined based on the cost of education estimated from Susenas 2004 (Table 1.3)
The funds for the first semester of the 2005/2006 academic year were disbursed in one batch and transferred directly to each school's bank account
The management of the funds should be undertaken by and became the responsibility of the school principal and the appointed teacher/treasurer, and their utilization should be based on the school budget (RAPBS) that had already been agreed by the school committee
Basically, all public and private primary and junior high schools, including SD/MI/SDLB, SMP/MTs/SMPLB and salafiyah as well as non-Islamic religious primary and junior high schools that are implementing the Wajardikdas Program,2 are entitled to receive BOS
Schools that receive BOS are required to follow all the regulations that have been set by the program, in regard to the way the funds are managed, the use of the funds, the accountability of the BOS funds received, as well as the monitoring and evaluation
Schools that are economically well-off and have an income larger than BOS funds are allowed to refuse BOS, if agreed by the parents and school committee
For BOS recipient schools, the following stipulations should be followed
- Schools whose total revenues from school tuition (before BOS) were less than BOS had to exempt students from all forms of levies/contributions/fees that were used to fund expenditures that could be funded by BOS (Table 1.2)
Schools were also asked to assist less well-off students who had experienced difficulty with transportation to and from school
- Schools whose revenues from school tuition (before BOS) were greater than BOS could still levy additional charges, but had to exempt poor students from school tuition, if there were poor students in the school
If there were BOS funds left over, after being used to subsidize poor students, these funds could be used to subsidize other students
If there were no poor students in the school, the BOS funds could be used to subsidize all students in order to reduce the tuition of the students
The Guide Book 2006 mentions that schools that refuse BOS also have to exempt poor students from school tuition, but this statement was not stated in the Operational Guidelines for 2005
The BOS Program is a central government program
is provided entirely from the national budget, and is implemented via the deconcentration funding mechanism
Program responsibility at the central government rests jointly with the Directorate General of Primary and Secondary Education (Ditjen Dikdasmen) - Ministry of National Education (Depdiknas), and the Directorate General of Islamic Institutions - Ministry of Religious Affairs (Depag)
This joint-management is undertaken because the management of primary and junior high schools has been devolved to the regions, and in principle under the direction of Depdiknas, while Madrasah Ibtidaiyah and Tsanawiyah have not yet been decentralized and are still under direct management and supervision of Depag
Apart from madrasah, salafiyah schools are also under the control of Depag
Program managers, or known as “satker”, at the central level consist of elements from Depdiknas and Depag
The head and treasurer of the satker are personnel from Depdiknas, while officials of Depdiknas and Depag fill the sections
The satker structure at the provincial and kabupaten/kota levels follows the structure of satker at the central level
Provincial satker consist of staff from the provincial education office and the provincial office of Depag, while the kabupaten/kota satker consists of staff from the district education office and the district office of Depag (Kandepag)
Because this program is conducted through the deconcentration mechanism, the province as the representative of the central government has a significant level of authority to appoint institutions to channel the funding and manage the allocation of BOS funds to the kabupaten/kota in their region
The number of students who obtained BOS funds and the volume of the BOS funds that were provided to each province in 2005 and 2006 are presented in Table 1.4
Almost all the BOS funds for 2005 had been disbursed, while the BOS funds for 2006 had only been disbursed as much as 46% of the total up to 31 May 2006
In the 2005 budget year, the total funding allocation for PKPS-BBM Education Sector Program that consists of the BKM Program for primary, junior high, and senior high schools from January to June, the BKM Program for junior high schools from July to December and BOS Program for primary and junior high schools for the July to December period, is approximately Rp6 trillion
At the same time, the total funding need for the PKPS-BBM Education Sector Program for 2006 is estimated at approximately Rp11 trillion (Table 1.5)
Of these funds, approximately 2% is allocated for the safeguarding activities, which are used for, inter alia, socialization, management administration, reporting, and program monitoring
The amount of safeguarding funds for the 2005 PKPS-BBM Education Sector, which totalled Rp128,423,300,131, was divided between the central government, provincial government, and kabupaten/kota government
The funds for provinces and kabupaten/kota were divided equally for all provinces and kabupaten/kota
There is no detailed information on the amount of the safeguarding funds that was allocated specifically for the socialization of BOS Program because these funds were not separated from the safeguarding fund for the BKM Program
In addition, in the detail of their usage as presented in Table 1.6, the socialization funds were included into one line item together with a series of other activities including planning, coordination, and training
1.3 METHODOLOGY The preparation of this rapid appraisal commenced in mid-January starting with a discussion of the terms of reference, interviews with various key resource persons and informants at the central government level, and preparing the field research instruments
The field research was conducted over an approximately three-week period from mid- February to early March 2006
The preliminary results of the study were presented and discussed in a seminar with a limited number of participants at Bappenas at the end of March 2006 and at Balitbang Depdiknas in early April 2006
On 2 July 2006, the findings of this study, together with the findings of other studies on PKPS BBM programs, were presented in Bappenas to a wider range of stakeholders
This study mainly used a qualitative approach through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions
Information and data were collected from program implementers at the central, provincial and kabupaten/kota levels and from schools
In addition, a variety of supporting information was also gathered through interviews with other relevant institutions and those involved in monitoring or observing the implementation of BOS Program
In-depth Interviews In-depth interviews were conducted to obtain detailed information on the program implementation at various levels
Information that was unearthed covered targeting, data collection, funds allocation, socialization, channeling, absorption and utilization of the funds, complaints and problem resolutions as well as monitoring, evaluation, and reporting
Furthermore, information on institutional affairs, especially the information associated with the joint-management approach as well as the impact of the program and the level of stakeholders' satisfaction with the implementation of BOS Program, was also collected
Indepth interviews were undertaken by using semi-structured guided questions
Informants that were interviewed in the relevant institutions at the central, provincial, and kabupaten/kota levels of government and in schools, among others, included
- Central level
central working unit (satker) that was set up in the Ministry of National Education, the Mapenda Directorate in the Ministry of Religious Affairs and several NGOs that had conducted monitoring of BOS Program; - Provincial level
provincial satker that were founded in the education office, the Mapenda in the provincial office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, relevant sections in the education office, Bappeda, financial institutions appointed to channel BOS funds, local mass media, and NGOs that monitored or observed the implementation of BOS Program; - Kabupaten/kota level
Kabupaten/kota satker that were established in the education office, the Mapenda and Pesantren3 sections in the kabupaten/kota office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, relevant regional government work units such as Bappeda, education council, the branch offices of financial institutions that channel the funds, financial institutions where schools opened their accounts, local mass media, NGOs and mass organizations that monitored or observed the implementation of BOS Program; - School level
school principals and BOS Program treasurers, school committees, private school management foundations, two teachers consisting of the permanent and the non-permanent ones, three parents consisting of one from the middle class and two from the less well-off category, and one additional parent whose child had dropped out of primary or junior high school who lived in the vicinity of the sample school
The interview with the students' parents also involved the students
Focus Group Discussions FGDs were conducted in each sample kabupaten/kota to uncover collective perceptions on the implementation and benefits of BOS Program
FGDs in each kabupaten/kota were divided into two groups, namely an FGD for stakeholders at the kabupaten/kota level (Institutional FGD) and an FGD for school principals and school committees (School FGD)
The Institutional FGD was attended by the satker manager, the staff of the education office, the staff of the district office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, several UPTD heads, the staff of Bappeda, representatives of the education council, journalists from the local media, several NGO activists and representatives from the DPRD
The School FGD was attended by the principals, school committees, and foundation boards from the sample schools and from several selected non-sample schools
There were a total of 20 FGDs, consisting of 10 institutional and 10 school FGDs
In each FGD, participants (whose numbers ranged between 9 and 15 people)4 were asked to write down the various problems that had occurred in each phase of the BOS implementation, and jointly group and discuss the problems that had been presented
In addition, each participant was asked to suggest alternative solutions to these problems by means of writing practical solutions, so the linkage between the existing problems and their alternative solutions could be clearly seen
After that, the participants were asked to provide an evaluation on the level of satisfaction to each stage of the BOS implementation, starting from the socialization phase, the selection and allocation, the channeling and absorption of funds, the utilization of the funds, complaints and problem handling, reporting, and monitoring and evaluation, as well as institutional affairs
In the assessment of the level of satisfaction, participants were asked to provide a score between 0 (very dissatisfied) up to 10 (very satisfied)
The assessment by each participant of the level of satisfaction was then recapitulated and one score was sought as an agreed outcome between all FGD participants
The results of this assessment are presented in the section on the impact on and the level of satisfaction with the implementation of BOS Program
In addition to discussing the implementation of the program, participants were also asked to give an opinion on the advantages and disadvantages of BOS Program in connection with the effort to enhance the access of the poor to basic education
At the end of the discussion, participants were also asked to provide an assessment of the level of benefit of BOS Program for the poor
They give a score and discuss the results of this assessment as was undertaken in the assessment of the program implementation and, finally, they were asked to discuss suggestions for enhancing the effectiveness of the program in regard to improving the access of the poor to basic education
Study Location The field study was conducted in ten kabupaten/kota located in five provinces (see Table 1.7 and Figure 1.1)
The selection of these sample provinces and kabupaten/kota was undertaken purposively by considering
geographical location in a variety of different islands (representation of islands/regions), kabupaten and kota (as representatives of rural and urban areas), variations in the level of BOS Program allocations (allocation levels that are high and low), and several kabupaten/kota were chosen in consideration of the location/region of the GDS (Governance and Decentralization Survey)
A minimum of four sample schools were selected in each kabupaten/kota, based on a quota of the types of schools that had been previously determined
The selection of schools was undertaken purposively in order to represent, as far as possible, all types, levels, and status of schools, as well as consider the variations in the recipient/nonrecipient schools, the economic status of the community in the vicinity of the school, and the distance of schools from the center of government administration and economic activity
The sample of salafiyah was chosen in provinces where there are many salafiyah based on the data obtained from the Ministry of Religious Affairs, which was in the provinces of Banten, East Java and West Nusa Tenggara
A total of 46 sample schools were visited during this study
state and private primary schools, state and private MI, state and private junior high schools, state and private MTs, and salafiyah primary and/or junior high schools (Table 1.8)
This study did not include special schools, either SDLB or SMPLB
Research Team There were a total of 11 SMERU researchers directly involved in this research, including an advisor, Sudarno Sumarto
The ten researchers included Widjajanti I Suharyo, Hastuti, Syaikhu Usman, Bambang Sulaksono, Nina Toyamah, Sri Budiyati, Wenefrida Dwi Widyanti, Meuthia Rosfadhila, R Justin Sodo and Sami Bazzi
These ten researchers were split into five teams, each of which had the responsibility of conducting the research in a province with a kabupaten and a kota in each of these provinces
In addition, there were 11 guest researchers and local researchers involved in this study Novi Anggriani, Inca Juanita, Yudi Fajar Margono, Wini Nahraeni, Dodik Sugiharto, Erwin Romulus Siahaan, Fivi Rahmatus Sofiyah, Ricky Rengkung, Djoni Hatidja, Syahbudin Hadid and M Aan Ardiansah
These guest and local researchers were also assigned to each location
The research team in each province consisted of two SMERU researchers and two guest or local researchers

RESEARCH FINDINGS Education is one of the government functions that have been devolved from the central government to regional governments (pemda)
According to Law No
32 of 2004 on Regional Government Administration, education is an obligatory function for regional governments, both provincial and kabupaten/kota, and for that reason, regional governments are obliged to manage and finance education
Until now, school operational costs have come from a number of sources, particularly from students via student tuition and various other forms of levies, from central and regional governments, and other sources including community contributions, business establishments, and other donors
The availability of school operating funds varies between regions, even between schools in the same region
This diversity is affected by the capability and commitment of regional governments and the community in supporting school activities
For that reason, there are schools that have very adequate educational facilities and supported by large budgets, but there are also schools with very minimal equipment and their budgets are actually inadequate for covering the operational needs of the school
In general, most school operating costs and even teachers' wages in private schools are funded by the students/community and administered by school management
The need to finance operating costs has triggered systems and institutions innovations, ranging from simple innovations to the complex ones
This rapid appraisal, for example, found a school that received parents' contributions in the form of harvest products to fund their operating costs
In other cases, there are also schools that receive funds from a variety of sources, such as the community, government, industry, and even funding assistance from international agencies
The BOS Program provides a significant amount of funding assistance for school operating activities, especially in comparison to the tuition of schools in rural areas and schools where the majority of students come from the middle to lower classes
This has changed the funding structure of schools in a significant way
For almost all schools in Indonesia in general, the volume of funds provided through this program and the guidelines governing their use and their administration represent something new that is very different to the usual system
On the one hand, the volume of funds received is very beneficial in reducing the burden on the community and educational institutions in the funding of schools
On the other hand, the various regulations on its implementation are deemed to be “making life difficult” for schools
Nevertheless, not all the inconvenience for schools resulting from the bureaucratic change demanded by BOS Program is assessed as having a negative impact
The difficulty is caused by the obligations placed on recipients to be accountable for the use of the funds, whether they are from government institutions or the community, that are in principle in accordance with the demand for professional administrative governance, honesty, transparency, and accountability
They are expected to reform and improve the capacity of educational institutions
In general, BOS Program has provided significant amount of assistance in the funding of education and in attempting to support capacity building in school management
However, this appraisal has, in general, found several weaknesses, both in the concept and design of the program and in the field implementation of the program
These findings are presented and discussed in the following analysis
2.1 TARGETING, DATA COLLECTION, AND ALLOCATIONS As presented in the sub-section on the general overview of the program, the targets of BOS program are all primary and junior high schools that are implementing the compulsory nine-year basic education program, and the size of the funding allocation was based on the number of students
The objective of the program mentioned in the 2005 operational guidelines does not put the stress on poor students
But the program guidelines gives an indication that this program has to give priority to poor students
Under such design, it is the school that has a very significant role in determining recipients of the program's benefits, because the school has the right to receive or refuse BOS as well as to determine the use of the funds
The discussion below will explain who the recipients of the program benefits are, as well as the data collection and the allocation of funds, which will also affect the distribution of program beneficiaries
2.1.1 Targeting In general, this study found that BOS Program tended to be implemented as a general subsidy so that all students, irrespective of the economic backgrounds of their family, received almost the same benefits
This occurred because only a minority of schools refused BOS
The benefits received by poor students and the non-poor in each school were almost the same because only a small proportion of the BOS funds were allocated to provide additional benefit for poor students
Non-recipient Schools As of the end of March 2006, the Central Satker did not have the data on the number of schools that had accepted or rejected BOS, but it was estimated that only a few schools had rejected BOS
The outcome of the visit to the sample kabupaten/kota in this study confirms this
Of the ten samples of kabupaten/kota visited, schools that rejected BOS were found in only one kabupaten and two kota, these being Kabupaten Lebak (one school or 0.1% of all the schools), Kota Cilegon (nine schools or 4% of the total), and Kota Pematang Siantar (13 schools or 6% of the total)
Of all the eligible public and private schools that had official permit in seven other sample kabupaten/kota, none had rejected BOS (Table 2.1)
In Kabupaten Lebak and Kota Pematang Siantar, schools that rejected BOS were relatively well-off or wealthy private schools, managed by religious foundations
These schools had charge relatively large school tuition of more than Rp50,000 per student per month
In Kota Cilegon, apart from the general private schools, there were six salafiyah at the junior high school level that also rejected BOS
For the wealthy private schools, the reason for rejecting BOS was that the school and foundation had some objections to several program requirements, especially related to the demand for transparency in financial management and the guidelines on the use of the funds that did not allow utilization for foundation activity and payment of the salary of civil servant teachers
Furthermore, some schools thought that they still able and willing to be independent in funding their school's operating cost by using student tuition
In Banten province, in particular, the appeal and emphasis during the socialization for schools not to impose any charge from students also became the reason for rejecting BOS
For salafiyah that rejected BOS, the main reason concerned the problems of financial administration that were considered to be too difficult for most of the managers
In all non-recipient schools visited, the decision to reject BOS was made unilaterally by the school and the foundation management without requesting the opinion of parents or the school committee as determined in the operational guidelines
The majority of parents in these schools did not understand the reason for the rejection because they had never been consulted
In Kabupaten Lebak and Kota Cilegon, several schools that rejected BOS had participated in the program socialization at the kabupaten/kota level
Schools in Kota Pematang Siantar that rejected BOS did not, in general, participate in the program socialization
They also did not send the submission form with the names and numbers of students as well as the number of the school bank account
The procedure for rejecting BOS by the schools differed between sample regions
In Kota Cilegon, for example, schools did not have to submit the rejection letter as required by the operational guidelines
These schools are known to have rejected BOS funds on the basis of the funds distribution report from the local post office, because until the end of February 2006, these schools did not withdraw the BOS funds that had been allocated and distributed to the school account prepared by PT Pos
In addition, there was a school that had withdrawn its BOS funds, but returned them to the post office a week later
In Kabupaten Lebak, the kabupaten satker requested a letter of rejection from the schools that refused BOS
In Kota Pematang Siantar, schools that rejected BOS could inform the rejection verbally or by telephone to the city satker
Targeting for Poor Students Although the operational guidelines have emphasized the obligation to give priority to poor students, the implementation of this policy has been fully delegated to schools
the implementation varies significantly between regions as well as between schools in the same region
This variation occurs because during the sozialization to schools not all kabupaten/kota satker emphasized the importance of giving priority to poor students
As a result, the decision to give special treatment to poor students highly depended on the decision of the school, especially of the principal
In the process of determining the policy regading poor students, school management did not, in general, involve the school committee or parents
Most schools decided to treat poor and non-poor students the same way in terms of tuition borne to students
Of the 43 samples of BOS recipient schools, only 48% provided special assistance to poor students
The forms of additional assistance provided by schools varied between schools and did not always follow the operational guidelines
transportation costs, uniforms, shoes, school bags, stationery, or exempting students from or reducing school tuition
Of the 32 schools whose revenue from monthly school tuition (not including receipts from new students) was less than BOS, only six schools (20%) provided assistance in the form of transportation costs for poor students
In fact, one of these schools provided transportation allowance not just for poor students, but also for other students whose home was quite far from school and needed transportation
Meanwhile, of the 11 other schools whose receipts from student tuition were larger than BOS and that should have exempted poor students from school tuition, only five schools (45%) did so
In the schools that provided special assistance to poor students, the number of poor students who obtained special assistance mostly ranged from 3% to 25% of the total number of students in each school
Only one school provided special assistance to 51% of the total students
However, the assistance provided was only for the provision of writing tools
Based on the data prepared by schools, the number of poor students in the sample schools in each province ranged between 17% and 34% of the total students, so only 12% up to 33% of all poor students had received special assistance
The smallest coverage was in Banten Province and the largest in North Sumatra (Table 2.2)
Of the total numbers of students in all sample schools, on average, the numbers of poor students who received special assistance were approximately 22% of the numbers of poor students or 6.5% of the total student numbers
The amount of special assistance provided for poor students was, in general, small
For example, the transportation allowance only ranged from Rp5,000 to Rp15,000 per student per month
It was also found that two schools provided Rp50,000 per student per month for the cost of transportation, but only five students received this kind of allowance in the first school and seven in the second school
The results of the analysis on the use of BOS funds also showed that, in general, the special assistance for poor students was not among the dominant expenditure items (see the analysis in Sub-section 2.4)
The rule set in the operational guidelines to give higher priority to poor students, but at the same time limiting the type of assistance, that is, in the form of allowance to cover the cost of transportation from their home to school for those who need it, seemed to discourage schools from providing assistance to poor students
Many schools, especially primary schools, did not provide assistance to poor students for the reason that all of their students lived in the vicinity of the school and did not need assistance for transportation
Several other schools explained that they had difficulty in determining the criteria of poor students
If assistance was given to several poor students who were selected by the school, there were concerns that it would give rise to protests from other students or their parents
The small allocations of funds, the limited number of poor students who obtained special assistance, and the reasons mentioned earlier indicate the limited attention of the schools to poor students
In fact, there are indications that the attention given to poor students could decrease during the implementation of BOS in the future
The reason for this concern is because there was a case where a school increased the economic status of parents in the list of students for the application of BOS funding submitted for the second semester of the 2005/2006 academic year
The data that was provided by this school showed that, in the form submitted for the first semester, the difference in the number of not well-off, less than well-off and well-off students in this school was 44%
42%
14%, while, in the form for the second semester, it became 0%
96%
4%
In fact, from SMERU's observation of students and several parents of this school, it appears that there are still quite a lot of students who could be classified as not well-off
Therefore, there is a need for program managers to undertake a special effort to prevent the widespread of similar cases
In schools that provided assistance for poor students, the means of selecting poor students was determined by each school
The criteria that were used to select the poor students were different across schools, although, it was commonly based on the students' appearance that can be seen from their uniform, shoes and schoolbag, the record on payment of school tuition, their status as an orphan or not, and their parents' job
A child whose parent worked as a civil servant was usually automatically classified as welloff
In general, poor students were selected based on the recommendation of the teacher who was responsible for the class
Only a limited number of schools undertook the selection of poor students through several phases, including a visit by the teacher to the home of the student who was suspected to be poor
Only some schools required the poor students to submit a letter of acknowledgement issued by the village administration, which confirms their parents' poor economic condition
Although only a minority of poor students received special assistance from BOS Program, it can be said that all students, including poor students, enjoyed the benefits from this program in the form of a reduction or even exemption from school tuition
Of the 42 sample BOS recipient schools in this study, 22 exempted their students from school tuition and the rest reduced the school tuition
Compared with the BKM Program, BOS had a broader or more equitable coverage because almost all students received the benefits of the program
Meanwhile, in the implementation of the BKM Program, there were many complaints in connection with the quota for the number of poor students who obtained BKM and the mistargeting of program recipients as a consequence of the criteria for poor students that were not clear
Due to the large coverage of BOS Program, all of the FGD participants, both in the kota and kabupaten, assessed BOS Program as being beneficial for the poor.7 Several of the parents whose children received BKM in the past also prefer BOS to BKM
The main reason for this preference is because all poor students will receive the benefit of the BOS Program, particularly a decrease in school costs
2.1.2 Data Collection and Funds Allocation With a targeting system that is more directed to general subsidies, the distribution of program benefits will be influenced by the data collection mechanism and funding allocation
In general, this study found several weaknesses in the data collection system, especially due to the weaknesses of the previous education information system and the limited time of program preparation so it was not possible to undertake an adequate data collection
Regarding the funds allocation, this appraisal found several criticisms of the formula used to calculate the funds allocation
Nevertheless, the flexibility and authority given to the provincial satker to adjust the funding allocations across kabupaten/kota and among schools in their area appear to have been very helpful in improving the distribution of funds, especially in conditions where the quality of preliminary data was still inadequate
Data Collection on the Number of Students According to BOS Program Operational Guidelines 2005, the data collection mechanism on the number of students should be undertaken in a series of steps in the manner presented in Figure 2.1
The central PKPS BBM team should collect data on student numbers for every school through the provincial and kabupaten/kota satker
The data from schools should be recapitulated by the kabupaten/kota satker and the results were submitted to the provincial satker
Furthermore, the data from all kabupaten/kota satker should be recapitulated by the provincial satker and submitted to the Central Satker
On the basis of this data, the Central Satker should prepare a draft allocation of BOS funds for every province and kabupaten/kota
In practice, the data collection process was not undertaken in the manner it should have been because of the short time between the time for the data collection process and the time for the determination of the budget for BOS funding
The Central Satker requested the data on student numbers from the provincial satker in approximately May-June 2005
With the short time available, it was not possible to collect and recapitulate the data from all schools on time
The school locations were spread out, especially in the kabupaten area, and this became a main impediment in the data collection process
Limitations on human resources, especially at the kabupaten/kota level to undertake the recapitulation of the school data also became an impediment to the submission of the data
Because of the time limitation, the data on the numbers of students that was submitted by the provincial satker to the Central Satker was not the updated one from the kabupaten/kota satker but instead the one that was already available based on the routine reports from the kabupaten/kota
So, the initial allocations of BOS funds for provinces were not based on the latest student data
The Central Satker in Depdiknas stated that the determination of allocations in the first phase for each province was determined by the Central Satker on the basis of the data presented in the routine school reports for the 2004-2005 academic year, although they were aware that this data was inaccurate because several regions were late in submitting data, especially after the implementation of regional autonomy
Several sample provincial satker stated, however, that the calculations of allocations for their province were based on the data submitted by the province, which was the available data at the time the request was made by the Central Satker
The data collection process by kabupaten/kota satker was generally undertaken in August 2005, after the allocation of student numbers that was to become the reference for the calculation of BOS funds at the provincial level was determined
This data was then used by the schools to determine the amount of BOS funds that was deemed to be their entitlement
Only in East Java the student data collection process from schools commenced in May-June 2005, by filling in the forms that had been prepared by the district education office
Each form was completed, signed by the school principal and school committee, and then submitted to the district education office
This data was recapitulated at the kabupaten/kota level and then submitted to the province
This data became one of the reference for the provincial and kabupaten/kota satker in verifying the allocation data
In the majority of the sample kabupaten/kota, the Technical Implementation Unit of the Education Office (Unit Pelaksana Teknis Dinas UPTD) and the Islamic Religion Education Supervisor, both at the kecamatan level, were involved in the data collection process
In general, the verification process on student numbers was weak because it was only conducted by comparing the submitted data with the available data from schools' routine monthly reports or only by comparing the allocation data with the data submitted by schools
whereas a direct verification to schools was only undertaken on a limited extent by the kabupaten/kota satker in several sample schools
The fact that adequate verification was not conducted, either by the kabupaten/kota or provincial satker, had provided an opportunity for schools and other related institutions to inflate the data on student numbers
In a kecamatan visited in North Sumatra, for example, there was a report from an NGO that was published in the local newspaper, which reported an indication that the UPTD had increased the numbers of students submitted by 18 primary schools
So, there was an excess of 432 students over the actual numbers
Meanwhile in Kota Cilegon, when the SMERU research team visited a salafiyah that was registered as a recipient of BOS funds, it appears that this school could not be found
According to the local community, this salafiyah had been closed for a long time because its owner had died
In most cases, the level of accuracy of the numbers of santri (students at traditional Islamic school) was very poor
This is because there has not yet been an adequate monitoring and data collection system developed for salafiyah, although salafiyah are considered to be a strategic educational institution in enhancing the access of the poor to basic education
In addition, education in traditional salafiyah is, in general, undertaken informally and is unbinding
Therefore, the number of studying santri is not certain and subject to change at any time
Consequently, it was difficult to obtain the exact numbers of santri in a salafiyah
Moreover, a lot of santri also attends public schools so there was a great possibility for double counting of these santri to occur
In general, the data on salafiyah was very weak
Among the five sample provinces, only East Java undertook a comprehensive data collection on salafiyah
To conduct this activity, the East Java provincial satker prepared a book containing the data on salafiyah and their students although its contents were not well understood by most salafiyah
In addition, East Java also carried out direct verification covering all salafiyah because of the concern that salafiyah students also attended public schools and this caused double counting
This concern was borne out; after the verification, the total allocation for salafiyah decreased by almost half
Other school student data in this province was also obtained from a data collection through school mapping that had been conducted for the preparation of the PSBMP program that had commenced since 2004. 
For the channeling of BOS funds for the second semester of the 2005-2006 academic year, in all sample provinces, with the exception of Banten, schools were again requested to submit the data on their student numbers
In general, the data used was the data as of December 2005 or January 2006
In Banten, the submission for second semester funds used the same data as that had been used for the first semester, so schools did not need to submit the latest data
The Management of BOS Allocation Many parties considered the formula for BOS allocations that was based only on the number of students was unfair, especially for schools that had small numbers of students
Early in the design of BOS Program, the Ministry of Religious Affairs did not agree with the determination of funding allocations based on the number of students, and suggested it be based on fixed costs and study groups
Schools that had few students would obtain a little amount of BOS funds while they had to bear fixed costs whose value did not depend on the number of students
For that reason, there were concerns that these schools would still experience financial difficulty in the effort to enhance quality teaching
Schools that had a lot of teachers paid by honorarium, many poor students and/or were located in isolated regions also experienced the same problem
Various parties are in the opinion that schools of these types need greater funding support than the allocations based on the number of students in order to enable them in achieving the same quality of teaching and learning activities as other schools
The allocation of funds based on the number of students was also assessed as inapropriate to be applied for salafiyah because the education in salafiyah is informal and not binding
Their students can enter and leave at any time so student numbers are often fluctuating
The funding need is also different because some salafiyah students (santri) live and stay in this pesantren
In addition, some salafiyah students also attend other formal schools
In East Java, in particular, santri are usually left temporarily by parents and can be picked up at any time
The education system in some salafiyah did not comply with the standards of wajardikdas because it did not have a clear curriculum
In addition, there were fundamental problems that impeded the implementation of basic education in several salafiyah, as it was found during this appraisal
They included inadequate numbers of teachers and poor facilities, very limited numbers of reference books and textbooks, as well as the lack of supervision from the local education office because salafiyah were not considered to be under their authority
If the data collection and funds allocation were conducted in accordance with the process stated in the program guidelines, the data on the number of students that was submitted by schools should have been the same as the data used as the basis for calculating BOS allocations by the Central Satker
Therefore, the funds allocated for each kabupaten/kota and each school would be consistent with the numbers of students targeted and, the allocation process for BOS funds could have been undertaken in accordance with the directive described in Figure 2.2
Nevertheless, the data collection process appears to have not run in the manner prescribed
the data on the actual number of students was different from the data used for calculating the allocation of BOS funds
This difference could not be avoided because of differences in the timing of the data collection and because of the transfer of students that happened during the data collection process
This allocation problem was discussed in the regional coordination meeting (rakor) that was attended by the provincial and kabupaten/kota satker
The province of Banten, for example, together with other provinces participated in the regional coordination meeting in Cipanas, Bogor, in July 2005
The province of East Java and NTB attended the regional rakor in Surabaya
As suggested by the provinces, eventually, a meeting was held in Jakarta on 17 October 2005, and it was agreed upon that the provinces were allowed to adjust or divert allocations from kabupaten/kota that had surpluses to those that experienced shortfalls
The adjustment of allocations could also be done from schools that had surpluses to those that had shortfalls
For that reason, the provincial satker had a significant role in the allocation process of BOS funds to the kabupaten/kota and schools
This decision was implemented in all sample provinces so most kabupaten/kota whose initial allocation had been insufficient could get more and even obtain adequate support
It its implementation, the process of allocating BOS funds to the kabupaten/kota varied across provinces
Some provincial satker made the decision unilaterally while others made it through a forum that involved the provincial satker and all kabupaten/kota satker in each province
(1) In North Sulawesi, East Java, and NTB, the provincial satker unilaterally determined the allocation for kabupaten/kota based on the available data
After finding out whether the kabupaten/kota allocation had experienced surplus or deficiency, there was a re-allocation
In this process, there was no verification of the data used as the basis for calculating allocations with the latest data collected by kabupaten/kota
(2) In North Sumatra and Banten provinces, the determination of the allocations for kabupaten/ kota was undertaken in a coordinating meeting at the provincial level which involved all the kabupaten/kota satker
The allocation of BOS funds for each kabupaten/kota was then calculated using an updated data submitted by schools to kabupaten/kota satker
This forum facilitated a process of verification and transfer of allocations from regions with a surplus to those with a shortfall
The distribution and re-allocation of BOS funds were based on the agreement among all the kabupaten/kota satker
In Banten, after the allocation data was agreed by all kabupaten/kota, there was a final verification by involving all the channeling institutions, which are the Serang Post Offices
Furthermore, the province issued a decree regarding the allocations per kabupaten/kota signed by the provincial education office and the provincial office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs
Subsequently, the kabupaten/kota satker distributed additional allocations to schools that experienced shortfalls in allocations and stipulated a decree on the allocations for each school
In Kabupaten Lebak, the allocation for each school was determined in the form of a decree of the head of the education office, while, in Kota Cilegon, it was determined in a joint decree of the education office and the kota office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs
In North Sumatra, it was agreed that if there was a gap in the allocation at the school level, the kabupaten/kota satker might transfer the funds from one school to other schools that were in the same kabupaten/kota without changing the allocation list at the Central Satker
The additional allocations were obtained from funds that had been returned by schools that obtained a greater allocation
Schools were not informed of this decision, however, and, in general, the allocation was in accordance with the school's proposal although not always the same as the number of students at the time the funds were distributed
In general, schools ignored the lack of funds if the discrepancy was small
In all the areas being studied, if the surplus funds were in a large amount, they were transferred back to the bank account of the provincial satker or simply not withdrawn by the schools
In the four of the five provinces visited, namely North Sumatra, East Java, North Sulawesi and NTB, these surplus funds were returned to the bank account of the provincial satker
In Banten, the surplus funds of BOS recipient schools were left in the school account at the post office by schools that rejected BOS
These funds were blocked so they could not be taken by the school
Because in Banten these surplus funds were not returned directly to the account of the provincial satker, there were gaps between the number of students who obtained BOS allocations and the actual number of students at the kabupaten/kota and school, either smaller or bigger
In this province, there had also been a statement that schools that experienced shortfalls in allocations could not apply for an additional allocation
For that reason, although there was an allocation surplus of 5,459 students at junior high schools level in Banten, many MTs experienced shortfalls
In Kabupaten Lebak, the funds received by most primary schools with more than 250 students were still insufficient
Allocations for salafiyah were, in general, less than those being proposed
The problem of BOS funding shortfalls of this kind were not found in the other four sample provinces because their funds channeling mechanism was more flexible (see also Sub-section 2.3) with the result that it was possible for additional funds to be provided for schools whose allocations fell short
2.2 SOCIALIZATION The socialization of BOS Program was undertaken through technical and non-technical approaches
The technical approach was organized by the institution in charge or program manager, both from the institutions which handled education and religious matters at the central, provincial and kabupaten/kota levels
This socialization was formally conducted after the program was officially launched around July 2005
However, the discourse on this program was already discussed in several workshop activities or working meetings for education agencies at the provincial level that were arranged by Depdiknas in May 2005
According to several parties that participated in these activities, the initial program concept being planned was School Operational Assistance for Free Education
The idea of free schooling was compounded by the non-technical socialization that also spread the idea of free schools
The non-technical socialization was usually aimed at serving political interests and was wrap in other activities, such as during the campaign for the election of regional heads of government (pilkada)
The information that was provided in the nontechnical socialization was only general in nature, including that on the existence and benefits of the program
During the pilkada campaign in several regions which coincided with the preparation and implementation of BOS Program, many officials promised to eliminate school tuition from basic education, when, in fact, they had not prepared a program similar to BOS
The contents of the socialization that did not refer to the stipulations of this program tended to cause misunderstandings in the community, especially in regions where the political campaigns were undertaken before the technical socialization of BOS Program was conducted
The socialization activities from the central level to the kabupaten/kota level was, in general, financed from the safeguarding funds for the PKPS-BBM Education Sector Program, which was very limited (see Table 1.4 and Table 1.5 in Sub-section 1.2)
Because the funds that were allocated by BOS Program were not sufficient to conduct adequate socialization activities, several regions conducted additional socialization activities that were funded by the local government administration
In general, socialization activities that should have been a crucial part in determining and influencing the level of success of the program was assessed as weak by many parties
The implementation of the program socialization had left behind problems such as little understanding by the community as well as many different interpretations of the program
The ineffectiveness of the socialization can also be seen from the fact that various parents interviewed, especially the poor ones, did not know that this program existed at all
This was caused by, inter alia, the limited socialization conducted by schools, while the socialization for the public through television, radio, and newspapers was not easily accessible to the poor
Apart from the inappropriate media used for socialization, the content or material delivered was also inappropriate
This is indicated by the fact that some still have the wrong understanding such as that schooling would be free after the provision of BOS, that not all schools could receive the program but only certain schools could, or that funds recipients were students and not schools because the size of the assistance was calculated based on the number of students
Although a number of deficiencies were still found in the implementation of the socialization, it was observed that the institutions in charge have devoted several efforts to expand the program socialization to related stakeholders as well as to the general public
Compared with other education programs, the socialization of BOS appears to be more successful, at least the program's name is more popular in the community
In addition, the range of participants in the socialization was also broader and undertaken in stages, beginning from the center to the provinces, kabupaten/kota, and schools
The implementation of the socialization in each stage uncovered in this study will be explained in the sub-sections below
2.2.1 Socialization at the Central Level At the central level or on a national scale, the socialization of BOS Program was organized by program consultants and the Central Satker in a three-days session in June 2005 at the Sahid Jaya Hotel Jakarta
Representatives of all provinces were invited to this socialization, including heads of education offices, heads of regional offices of the Ministry of Religious Affairs (Kanwil Depag), and the provincial satker candidates
The participants in the socialization at the central level were expected to become the source of information in further socialization activities, both at the provincial and the lower levels
During this socialization, material on BOS Program was provided, including the background of the program, the requirements and technical aspects of the implementation, the determination of allocations, the channeling mechanism, and the regulations and sanctions for breaches
The written material provided was the operational guidelines and technical guidelines as well as photocopies of the presentation material
At the national level, the socialization was also provided for all the heads of the education councils, although it was not delivered in a BOS special forum
The socialization was given during a school-based management training that was arranged in Cisarua from 18 to 20 August 2005
Apart from the main subject of the training, an explanation on BOS Program was also delivered in this forum
The main subject of the forum was on the short and long terms school planning, including the preparation of school budgets (RAPBS)
In addition to providing the socialization directly for the related institutions, the satker and program consultants at the central level also conducted a socialization program for the general public through community service announcements in the printed and electronic media
In the advertisements presented on television, however, the message being delivered gave the impression that under BOS school would be free of charge
This message was assessed as causing public misperception because, in reality, not all schools were able to exempt their students from school tuition
Furthermore, there was information that mentioned the value of BOS assistance per student, which also caused many parents to believe that their child would receive an amount of cash from BOS Program as it was the case with the BKM Program
To fix this, the Central Satker revised the community service announcement material that was presented on television
The new version of the advertisement no longer stressed that schools would be free of charge
This advertisement stressed that those who are poor had to be given higher priority, and the regional government as well as the well-off families were requested to continue to assist in achieveing the goal of the compulsory nine-year basic education program for all school-age children in Indonesia
In addition to these community service announcements, a brochure was prepared to be distributed among various circles
However, this media, which should have been able to provide clearer information for the public, was not well distributed
During this appraisal, almost none of these brochures were found, either at the provincial, kabupaten/kota levels, in schools, or in the community
It was not clear how and to whom these brochures were distributed
2.2.2 Socialization at the Regional and Provincial Levels Socialization at the provincial and regional levels was targetted to program managers at the kabupaten/kota level
The regional-level socialization was organized in three cities, namely
Yogyakarta, Surabaya, and Makassar, simultaneuosly at the end of July 2005
The Central Satker and consultants organized this three-days socialization session
In addition to the regional-level socialization, the provincial satker also arranged similar activities in each province in August 2005, and this lasted for approximately three days
With the exception of North Sulawesi, the socialization at the provincial level was conducted more than one time
Participants of the provincial-level socialization were all of the kabupaten/kota satker, the head kabupaten/kota of the education office and head of the kabupaten/kota office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs
They were expected to be the resource persons of socialization for the program managers at the school level
In North Sumatra, the kabupaten/kota education councils were also invited in the socialization activity
In other regions such as Kota Pasuruan, Kabupaten Malang and Minahasa Utara, the province did not conduct socialization for kabupaten/kota education councils
The socialization for the kabupaten/kota education councils was undertaken together with the socialization for schools (principals)
In the socialization at the provincial level, as it was the case with similar activities at the central level, written material in the form of photocopies of the presentation material, and operational and technical guidelines were distributed
The socialization subjects were of a similar kind, which were those related to an understanding of the program and its requirements
In addition to the topic on BOS, in the regional-level socialization, other topics being delivered were regarding the implementation of primary and secondary education
Therefore, the kabupaten/kota satker at least attended two socialization events with ample of time
Because of that, it was reasonable to hope that they could deliver information to program managers at the school level
In its implementation, however, it was not always the case given the differences in the capabilities of individuals in understanding the subjects, which resulted in varied levels of understanding on the program and the conditionalities for its implementation
Furthermore, the large number of participants, particularly at the time of the regional-level socialization, made it less effective for the delivery of technical subjects, and it was even worse when the method used to deliver the material was inappropriate
This could certainly affect the level of success of the program implementation in each region
Apart from the formal socialization to implementing institutions at the kabupaten/kota level, several provincial satker also conducted socialization to institutions that were not directly associated with the program implementation
In North Sumatra, East Java, and NTB, the provincial satker organized socialization programs to the mass media, NGOs, and universities
In addition, in Banten, the satker also provided socialization to the general public through printed media and talk shows on the radio
Moreover, in North Sumatra and Banten, information on the names of schools, number of students, and the amount of BOS funds allocated to each school was published in one local newspapers
In North Sulawesi, socialization of this kind was not conducted
The local media such as TVRI and RRI did request the provincial satker to present an interactive dialogue program, but the satker did not respond because there were no funds available
This was due to limited funding for socialization, meanwhile the media required that the party presenting the program bear the production cost because it was considered as a media campaign to promote BOS Program
This obstacle certainly impeded the socialization program for general public
In fact, the media also did not understand the program and its requirements because they had never been officially involved in the socialization
As a result, the media/press that should have had a role in the socialization was not able to function optimally
2.2.3 Socialization at the Kabupaten/Kota Level After participating in the socialization at the regional and provincial level, the kabupaten/kota satker were responsible for conducting the socialization for program managers at the school level in each of their working areas
The method, time and frequency of implementation, as well as in the number of participants of the socialization for all schools at the primary and junior high levels varied across kabupaten/kota
The first formal socialization in kabupaten/kota was carried out around the end of July or early August 2005
Many parties considered that this socialization was too late because the implementation of BOS Program should have been commenced in July 2005
Ideally, the program socialization should have been conducted before this program was in effect
The subjects delivered was mostly the same as that had been obtained by the kabupaten/kota satker during the previous socialization, which were an explanation about the program and the requirements of program implementation as set out in the operational and technical guidelines
The written material that was provided included photocopies of the presentation materials
In addition, in Kota Cilegon, Pematang Siantar, Manado, and Kabupaten Minahasa Utara, each school was given a photocopy of the operational and technical guidelines at the time of the socialization, while, in other regions, photocopies of the operational and technical guidelines were obtained by schools after the socialization was conducted
They were photocopied either by the associated institutions or by the schools themselves
Around September or October 2005, most schools also received the original operational and technical guidelines that had been sent by post from the Central Satker
In most cases, the socialization in the kabupaten/kota lasted in a day, in the form of a briefing
This method, in addition to the large number of participants that included all primary, junior and, even, senior high schools, was assessed as ineffective because it resulted in the participants' poor understanding of the material presented
As a consequence, many schools, especially schools whose human resources are limited, had difficulty in managing the administration of BOS Program, such as the preparation of reports, procedures for the payment of tax, or even in understanding the rules concerning the use of the funds
Nevertheless, the implementation of the socialization for program managers at the school level was very much dependent on the capability and creativity of the education office, the Ministry of Religious Affairs office, and BOS managers as well as other satker teams at the kabupaten/kota level
Although, based on the funding allocation obtained, the kabupaten/kota satker only had an obligation to undertake one socialization meeting, there were some kabupaten/kota satker that undertook it more than once
Moreover, satker in several kabupaten activated the UPTD to provide additional socialization for primary schools in each kecamatan
In addition, the satker and UPTD also provided informal guidance in the form of consultations for schools that had difficulty in preparing RAPBS, determining the use of BOS funds, and preparing reports
Other form of socialization that was quite helpful to schools in understanding BOS Program and its requirements were the bulletin “Pelangi” that was published by Depdiknas
In the October 2005 edition, this bulletin specially covered BOS Program, including the requirements, problems, case studies of the implementation, as well as the questions and answers on the management of the funds
Several school principals and BOS treasurers admitted that this bulletin represented an appropriate information medium and was very helpful for school management because it discussed issues that were closely related with the various education activities and education programs
Although this bulletin could be obtained free of charge, not all schools did, in fact, receive it
Of all schools visited in this study, only one junor high school had received this bulletin
For example, the October 2005 edition that extensively covered BOS Program was received by the school in December 2005, when the BOS funds for this semester had been spent and the report had almost been completed
This shows that the availability of good socialization material is not automatically useful and does not provide a better understanding if it is not supported by an adequate distribution mechanism
Other complaints from schools rearding socialization were that not all instructors of the socialization or the training had a full understanding of the BOS Program and its requirements
As a result, the information that was delivered was sometimes not sufficient enough or does not fully answers the questions of BOS Program managers/implementers at the school level
In this socialization, there was not a lot of emphasis on prioritizing the benefits for poor students
The issue that was most emphasized was on the carefulness in managing the funds and warning against corruption in the use of the funds received
In all sample districts, the UPTD was not provided with special socialization of the program
In general, they were given the socialization together with schools, whereas, their role in the implementation of the program was quite important, especially in the kabupaten area
Among other things, they had a role in data collection, namely in collecting the lists of names of students that were submitted by schools, doing a recapitulation, and submitting the lists to the kabupaten/kota satker, as well as in providing additional socialization and assistance to schools, especially to primary schools
Because of their functions and tasks, UPTD were often required to assist schools in resolving problems the schools faced, including the difficulty in the preparation of RAPBS and BOS reports
Because of their limited understanding of this matter, they were not optimally suited to their function
In fact, it is very possible that their explanation was inconsistent with the explanation of other parties, for example, satker, thus creating confusion among the schools
With the exception of Kota Mataram, Pasuruan, and Manado, school committees were not involved in the socialization for schools in the kabupaten/kota
This could be because the socialization to school committees was considered to be the responsibility of schools although this issue was not stressed on in the operational guidelines
In Kabupaten Minahasa Utara, the education council took the initiative to arrange the socialization of BOS Program for school committees, and included it on the agenda of socialization activities of the functions and tasks of school committees
Not all heads of school committees, however, attended these activities given that most of them had other activities
As a result, there were still many school committees that did not understand BOS Program
With the exception of East Java, not all funds channeling institutions or banks where schools opened an account were included in the socialization
In Tapanuli Utara, for example, because the only channeling institution that was involved in the socialization was Bank Sumut, Bank BRI where most of the schools opened new accounts only knew of the existence of BOS after a rather large volume of funds were transferred to school accounts
Consequently, when the schools opened new accounts at various branch offices of Bank BRI in this district, the bank did not put a special requirement in the manner determined in the operational guidelines of the program
As a result, there were accounts that were jointly signed by the school principal and BOS treasurer, but there were also some that were only signed by the school principal
Although there were deficiencies in the implementation of the formal socialization, there were also kabupaten/kota satker that took the initiative to extend the dissemination of information
In Kota Pematang Siantar, for example, the city satker also specially provided socialization to all officials at the city level, with participants from Bappeda, education council, DPRD, echelon III officials in the education office, officials of the Ministry of Religious Affairs office and PGRI
The local government of Kota Cilegon also printed 2,000 BOS brochures that were then distributed to relevant agencies and schools
Meanwhile, the provincial satker in Banten re-printed the operational and technical guidelines for BOS Program to be distributed to relevant institutions and a number of schools
2.2.4 Socialization at the School Level The schools, especially the school principals, were expected to conduct the socialization for teachers, school committees, parents, and students
In its implementation, however, not all schools undertook sufficient socialization activities of BOS Program for all stakeholders at the school level
Mostly, schools socialized BOS Program to all stakeholders in the school during the parents' meeting
This meeting was usually attended by teachers, school committees and parents
The conduct of this forum varied between schools
Some schools held the meeting one time, which was later in the new teaching year after there was a certainty that they are going to receive the BOS funds, or at the time of distribution of the students' report books at the end of Semester I
Some other schools held the meeting more than once, first at the start of the semester, which was a routine meeting, and after the BOS funds were received or there were certainty in receiving it
In schools that conducted more than one meeting, the information on BOS Program that was given at the first meeting was only on the possibility of obtaining the BOS funds, while at the second meeting, the information was quite detailed
In general, the material that was delivered at the parents' meeting was a general explanation on BOS Program, the funds obtained, their use, and the stipulations regarding school tuition
However, there were also schools that only announced that the school received BOS funds without informing the amount of money received and the plan of their use
Although most schools made an effort to undertake socialization activities through parents meeting, many parents did not attend it, so not all of them knew the information on BOS Program
It showed that it is not sufficient to socialize the program only through parents meetings
Several reasons for the non-attendance of parents include sickness, other commitments, or their not having money – while there were still arrears of school tuition
The latter was especially ironic considering that an objective of the program was to assist poor students
Therefore, the objective of an activity, such as in the case of the socialization of BOS Program, needs to be clearly explained early on because some parents think that parents' meetings are usually aimed at discussing the increase in school tuition and other education contributions
Although many parents did not attend the socialization at their school, most of them knew of the existence of BOS Program
They got the information from various media, neighbors, other students' parents, or their children
The school committee also became a source of information for parents
In fact, in one of the research areas, there was a school committee that made an effort to socialize BOS Program through announcements in places of worship
Especially for teachers and school committees, other socialization programs were also provided by schools, besides the parents' meetings
In some schools, the information on BOS Program was presented to the teachers at the routine teachers' meetings that were conducted before the parents' meetings
The information that was delivered, however, was not in detailed and limited only to inform that the school received BOS
Only in a few schools were teachers provided with fairly detailed information on the amount of BOS funds received as well as on the general plan for their use
Meanwhile, there were very few schools that provided specific socialization for school committees
In such schools, the school committee was informed about the existence of BOS and the direction of their use before the parents meeting was organized
In fact, there were school committees that were asked to study the operational guidelines of the program so they could support the school principal in providing information in the parents meeting
In most schools, the school committee only participated in signing the RAPBS that had already been prepared and attended the parents meeting
There were also school committees that were not aware of the BOS program because they did not attend the parents meeting and, when signing the RAPBS, they were not given any explanation
Only a few schools informed their students of the receipt of BOS funds and this was usually done during the school's flag-raising ceremony
Most other schools did not provide socialization directly to the students
Nevertheless, almost all students knew of the existence of BOS because they felt the benefits directly through the elimination of or reduction in school tuition, and the availability of textbooks to be borrowed
2.3 DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS 
In the operational guidelines for BOS Program 2005, it was stated that BOS funds for the first six months would be distributed simultaneously to school accounts
The channeling of BOS funds was conducted by the provincial satker through the appointed channeling institutions by using the following mechanism
(i) the provincial satker submits a SPP-LS (Direct Payment Application) for BOS funds to the provincial education office; 
(ii) the provincial education office verifies the SPP-LS and issues a SPM-LS (Direct Payment Instruction) to be given to the provincial KPPN (State Treasury Office); 
(iii) the provincial KPPN verifies the SPM-LS and issues a SP2D (Funding Disbursement Instruction) that debits the treasury account; 
(iv) based on this SP2D, BOS funds were transferred to the bank account of the provincial satker; 
(v) BOS funds from the account of the provincial satker at the appointed channeling institution are sent to the school bank account of the BOS recipient in accordance with the cooperative agreement between the provincial education office (satker) with the appointed channeling institution (Figure 2.3)
In general, this study found that the channeling of funds was undertaken in accordance with the mechanism determined in the operational guideline
The policy for the channeling of BOS funds directly to school accounts was assessed as quite appropriate because, in general, it ran smoothly and the funds were received in full
Nevertheless, there were several differences in the BOS funds channeling mechanism, the means of appointing channeling institutions, and other policies associated with the regulation regarding school accounts, which eventually impacted the performance of the distribution of funds
These differences are explained in the following discussion
2.3.1 Schedule and Mechanism of Funds Distribution In most sample provinces, the distribution mechanism of BOS funds, starting from the submission of the SPP-LS by the provincial satker, the transfer of the funds to the bank account of the provincial satker in the channeling institution, up to the transfer of the funds to the school's bank accounts, proceeded in accordance with the procedure presented above
Only in East Java was the distribution of funds to the school accounts not transferred directly from the account of the provincial satker, but through giro savings in the name of the head of the Kabupaten/Kota education office at the Bank Jatim branch in each kabupaten/kota
The channeling mechanism of BOS funds in each sample province is presented in Appendices 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
Many parties assessed the funds channeling system that transfers funds directly from channeling institutions to the school account as appropriate because it lessened the bureaucratic impediments that often caused funds leakages
Nevertheless, the channeling of funds from the provincial satker's bank account to the school's account sometimes did not run smoothly because of some technical obstacles, such as the errors in the school's bank account number
This caused delays in the receipt of funds by schools
In general, BOS funds were credited to the accounts of the provincial satker at the bank/post office in September 2005, with the exception of East Java whose funds were credited in mid-July 2005 (Table 2.3)
Of the five provinces visited, only East Java received the funds relatively early although it was received almost two months after the begining of the 2005-2006 academic year
In the other four provinces, however, funds were received late for more than two months and, even up to nearly three months
As a result of this delay, most schools experienced difficulty in managing school expenses, especially those that had not levied or had reduced their school tuition early in the 2005/2006 academic year
The grace period between the tranfer of the funds to the provincial satker account and tranfer to the schools' bank accounts varied between provinces, depending on the agreement between the satker and the channeling institutions, the completeness of data on the number of students and school accounts that had been received by the provincial satker, as well as the transfer process from the channeling institution to the bank where the school account was kept
In North Sulawesi, for example, if the school account was held at the branch of the channeling institution, the funds would be received in the school accounts one day after the funds were received in the provincial satker account
In Banten, the time needed from the credit of the funds in the provincial satker account to its being received in the school account was around six days
This grace period occurred because the post office was given the opportunity by the provincial satker to ‘settle' the funds for two days before they were distributed to the schools' account
The ‘settling' of the funds was managed by the financial director at the central office of PT Pos in Bandung in the form of daily deposits and open giro in several state-owned banks
The interest of this settling of the funds was used for, among other things, the funding of the distribution of the BOS funds
In East Java, although the funds were already in the account of the provincial satker on 18 July 2005, they were credited to the bank accounts of schools approximately one and a half months later, that was between 22 and 30 August 2005
This delay occurred because there was a process of the transfer of funds from the provincial satker account to the account of the head of the Kabupaten/Kota Education Office that had only been done on 18 August 2005
This grace period also occurred in NTB
However, the gap was only around 12 days
In East Java, North Sulawesi and North Sumatra, the dispatch of BOS funds to school accounts was not done at the same time
The time difference in this transfer occurred because at the time when the funds could be distributed, there were still a number of kabupaten/kota whose school data was not yet complete, so the channeling of funds was done in stages based on the completeness of data
In Manado, whether the bank where schools opened their accounts was online or not, also affected how fast the BOS funds entered school accounts
If the schools held their account at a branch of the BRI that was online, the BOS funds had entered the school accounts
If, however, the school account was kept in a BRI unit that was not online, the funds credited to the school's account around the first week of October 2005
In Kota Pematang Siantar, in general, BOS funds were credited to school accounts around the end of September to October 2005, except for eight schools that experienced delays of up to a month
This delay occurred because school accounts were opened at the BRI that was not online
To overcome this problem, these schools were then requested to open new accounts at the branch appointed by channeling institution - Bank Sumut, so the transfer could be done faster
The delays in the distribution of BOS funds still happened in the second semester of the 2005/2006 academic year, even though the data on school accounts should have been already available
In four sample provinces, with the exception of East Java, up to early- March 2006, BOS funds had not been transferred to school accounts
Only in East Java BOS funds have been transferred to school's accounts commencing on 16 February 2006
The cause of this delay was, inter alia, the lack of communication between the provincial and kabupaten/kota satker and/or because the required data was not yet completed
As explained in the sub-section on data collection, for the distribution in the second semester of 2005-2006, the kabupaten/kota satker was asked to submit the latest data on the number of students and school bank accounts
Several kabupaten/kota satker, however, obtained the information on this request for updated data at the end of February or early April 2006
In Banten, particularly, this delay occurred because of the delay in the stipulation of the governor decree on the satker's structure and the appointment of the person in charge at the provincial level for 2006
This is due to the political instability of the provincial leadership
The delay in the distribution of the second semester funding caused most schools to experience financial difficulty because most schools no longer levied school tuition on students
To overcome this problem, schools delayed payments of teachers' honorarium, used student savings, or borrowed money
Because of this delay, there were, in fact, schools that in the first semester had not levied school tuition, re-imposed school tuition from students because they were unsure when or whether BOS funds would be received
2.3.2 Channeling Institutions The appointment of channeling institutions for the BOS funds was the full authority of the provincial education office
This stipulation was not explicitly stated in the operational guidelines
However, the guidelines did mention the existence of cooperative agreements between the provincial education office and the channeling institution
In addition, because the BOS funds were from the Depdiknas deconcentration funds, it should be implemented by the province's technical agency, that is, the provincial education office
The procedure for the appointment of channeling institutions that was undertaken by the provincial satker in the sample provinces was varied
The reasons for the selection or appointment were also different, there were some satkers that considered the excellence in service, but there were also others that considered political reasons and did not consider the convenience of the service for schools
The provinces of East Java, North Sumatra, and NTB appointed their regional development banks, namely Bank Jatim, Bank Sumut, and Bank NTB as the channeling institutions, while the province of North Sulawesi appointed BRI and the province of Banten appointed PT Pos as the channeling institution
The process of appointing channeling institutions was mostly not undertaken via a transparent mechanism
Of the five provinces visited, only Banten conducted a selection process for the channeling institution through an open tender process by involving the provincial and kabupaten/kota satker
The selection process was preceded by distributing an invitation to existing financial institutions such as PT Pos, BRI, BNI, Bank Mandiri, and Bank Jabar to submit a proposal to be become the channeling institution for BOS funds
Of the three institutions that submitted their proposals, namely PT Pos, Bank Mandiri and BRI, it was PT Pos that was selected as the channeling institution
The reason for choosing PT Pos is because their service network is the most extensive and covering all kecamatan; their service is available via giro accounts (without interest); and they provide a reporting system and a complaints box free-of-charge
In the province of Banten, PT Pos has 83 service points that consist of six representative post offices at the kabupaten/kota level and 77 branches that are mostly located at the kecamatan level
In other regions, the appointment of channeling institutions was undertaken unilaterally by the provincial satker, after obtaining suggestions from the local governments, and taking regional interests as well as existing cooperative experiences into account
The appointment of regional development banks - BPD (Bank Jatim, Bank Sumut, and Bank NTB) was, in most cases, to maximize the utilization of regional assets and to improve the performance of the banks owned by these regions
This appointment was usually approved by the governor and regent/mayor
Other rationales for the appointment of Bank Jatim were because the local education office already established cooperation in channeling the funds of various education programs in the past and most schools held their accounts at this bank
For the kabupaten that have large areas, the appointment of Bank Jatim, which does not have a branch office in every kecamatan, made it difficult for schools to withdraw the BOS funds because the location of the bank office is relatively far and it costs quite a lot for transportation
The appointment of Bank NTB as the channeling institution was assessed by many parties as not sufficiently taking into account the elements that very much determined the effectiveness and efficiency of the funds disbursement process, such as
bank interest, the bank's networks and facilities, mobility, as well as the bank's experience
Bank NTB initially promised to deliver the funds to each school, but this promise was never realized because of their limited branch offices at the kecamatan level
For the same reason, the distribution of funds in Kota Mataram was undertaken in the premise of the local education office
Some of the funds disbursment activities in Kabupaten Lombok Tengah were also done in the UPTD office
The delivery of funds in these government offices certainly increased the opportunities for the imposition of unofficial levies, although this study did not find such cases
The appointment of BRI as the channeling institution in North Sulawesi was based on, inter alia, their experience in the previous cooperation with the local education office, especially in LPMG (Institute for the Enhancement of Teachers' Quality) activities
In addition, BRI also has a relatively larger number of service units compared with other government banks in North Sulawesi
Meanwhile, the appointment of Bank Sumut in North Sumatra was undertaken on the directive of the provincial government with the consideration that Bank Sumut already had branches in all kabupaten/kota as well as in many kecamatan
For the services in the kecamatan where Bank Sumut did not have a branch yet, mobile service vehicles were provided
For the BOS service, in particular, Bank Sumut was willing to transfer funds to schools' bank accounts that had been kept at any bank, free-of-charge, and agreed that the funds would be transferred at the maximum of seven days after the funds credited to the account of the provincial satker and the data on the schools' bank accounts had been received by Bank Sumut
2.3.3 School Bank Accounts Because the channeling institutions had to transfer the funds directly to the school's bank accounts, all BOS recipient schools had to own a school bank account under an institutional name
According to the program guideline, this account could not be under a private name and had to be signed by the school principal and BOS treasurer
Accordingly, schools have to send the bank account number to the kabupaten/kota satker by filling in the available form
After that, the kabupaten/kota satker verifies and compiles the account numbers of all recipient schools and send them to the provincial satker
The regulations regarding the opening of schools' bank accounts varied between regions depending on the policy of the satker and the appointed channeling institution
Some regions required schools to open their accounts at the pre-determined channeling institutions, but some others fully devolved the choice of the place to open the accounts to each school
In NTB, for example, for efficiency reason, all BOS recipient schools had to open a new account at Bank NTB to avoid additional costs such as clearing and transfer costs
This stipulation tended to put additional burden to schools because apart from having to provide special time and fulfill its administrative requirements, they also had to provide an initial deposit
Some parties considered that the requirement for schools to open accounts at particular financial institutions that had limited networks and facilities overlooked the effectiveness of the service that could be provided and would make it difficult for schools when withdrawing the funds
In contrast to the NTB case, in North Sumatra, although the appointed channeling institution was Bank Sumut, schools were given the freedom to open accounts at the post office or other government banks and there was no requirement for schools to open new accounts
The majority of schools in North Sumatra opened accounts at BRI because BRI is a bank that was already accustomed to distributing funds for educational programs in the past and its service units are available up to the kecamatan level
The case in North Sulawesi was the same
There was no stipulation for schools to open accounts at the same bank as the channeling institutions; schools were not required to open new accounts
In accordance with the agreement between the provincial satker and the channeling institutions, in these two provinces, schools that opened accounts at other financial institutions were not charged with transfer fees
In East Java, the cooperation between Bank Jatim and the local education circle have been established for quite some time
Since January 2004, that was when the implementation of the PSBMP commenced, all SD/MI and SMP/MT have had a bank account at this bank
The account for this PSBMP was also used for BOS Program so schools did not need to open a new account
However, salafiyah, did not yet have an account because they were not included as PSBMP recipients
In Banten, the post office had created a giro account for all schools so they did not need to open an account
Nevertheless, because they had been unofficially informed that the BOS recipient schools were required to have a school account, many schools had already opened an account at BRI before it was announced that funds would be channeled through post offices
These BRI accounts were eventually abandoned although schools had already made an initial deposit in the range of Rp100,000 – Rp150,000
Furthermore, although a giro account had already been opened at the post office, schools were still asked to complete a form for the bank account number, which was then submitted to the kabupaten/kota satker through the post office
The post office also submitted a compilation of school account numbers to the provincial satker
The stipulation that school bank accounts had to be signed by the school principal and BOS treasurer was not always well socialized to the channeling institutions and banks where schools opened their account
As a consequence, in Kabupaten Tapanuli Utara, some school accounts were only signed by the school principal
This happened because the banks where the schools opened the account did not know that this account was for the needs of a particular program and had to be signed by two people
The school accounts that are only signed by one person increased the chance of corruption
2.4 ABSORPTION AND UTILIZATION OF FUNDS By the end of December 2005, almost 99% of the BOS funds for the July-December 2005 period that were distributed by banks/post offices had been transfered to the school bank accounts of the BOS recipients in all sample provinces (Table 2.4)
In all sample provinces, there were still BOS funds left over in the account of the provincial satker
However, the amount was, at most, approximately 1% of the total funds allocated
These funds originated from the surplus allocations in several BOS recipient schools and the funds that were not taken by schools that had rejected BOS Program
In Banten, in particular, the left over funds originated from the funds allocated for schools of the SMP level or the equivalent, while for SD level or the equivalent, the funds had been distributed in their entirety
In North Sumatra and North Sulawesi provinces, there was no data available on the volume of funds that had actually been withdrawn by each school because schools could open an account at any bank and the school account was treated as a regular account
The bank where the account was kept was not obliged to report the withdrawal of funds by the schools
For that reason, the data for North Sumatra and North Sulawesi presented in Table 2.4 is the data on the balance of the BOS funds that were kept in the account of the provincial satker
In East Java, NTB, and Banten, the branches of the channeling institutions routinely reported the disbursement of the BOS funds by schools where the school accounts were kept
In Banten, in particular, with a special giro account number for the BOS funds that was separate from other types of transactions, the post office could keep track of the amounts of funds that were already withdrawn by schools each time
The level of absorption of the BOS funds by schools in Banten up to the end of January 2006 (by 1 February 2006) was 98.8%, in Kabupaten Lebak 99.5% and in Kota Cilegon 96.6%
The level of absorption of the BOS funds by schools in Kota Cilegon was smaller than that by schools in other kabupaten/kota in Banten because several schools in this city did not withdraw the funds or rejected the BOS 
Although the post office had prepared the accounts and transferred the funds for these schools
In Kabupaten Lebak, all schools withdrew the funds, and the remainder was only the savings balance in the form of funds allocation surpluses, especially for junior high schools
The management and usage of BOS funds that had been deposited to school accounts were under the responsibility of each school
This appraisal noted several problems in the management of BOS funds by schools, especially in regard to the capacity of schools in preparing RAPBS (school budgets), the regulation of funds withdrawals from school accounts, the use of funds, and the lack of clarity of regulations on bank interest and the payment of tax
The discussion below will present these problems
2.4.1 Management of Funds at the School Level There are at least two important issues that need to receive attention in association with the management of the BOS funds at the school level, namely in regard to the RAPBS that are mandated as the basis for the use of the BOS funds, and the local policy on the regulations for the withdrawal of funds from school's accounts
Preparation of RAPBS In most cases, each school prepared RAPBS in the July-August period after they received a request, either verbally or by letter, from the local education office to submit their RAPBS
Although RAPBS was a requirement that had to be fulfilled by schools in order to obtain the BOS funds, most schools still experienced difficulty in preparing it and the preparation proses also did not yet engage the parties that should be involved
Only some schools used to prepare RAPBS, especially those that had received funds from certain programs such as Direct Assistance Funds (DBL), Decentralized Basic Education Project (DBEP) or PSBMP
These programs not only stipulated an RAPBS, but also required schools that participated in the project to undertake training in RAPBS preparation
In some districts, public schools were familiar with RAPBS preparation
However, in many other districts, the schools did not prepare RAPBS yet, although all schools should have made RAPBS and routinely reported to the local kabupaten/kota education office at the commencement of each academic year
Because of the lack of assistance and supervision, many schools did not undertake it, except with a special request
When BOS Program demanded each school to submit an RAPBS, most schools had difficulty in preparing it, despite the provision of an example of the RAPBS format in the BOS operational guidelines
Apart from the reason that schools were not used to preparing RAPBS, this difficulty arose because schools had to adapt RAPBS contents to be in line with the requirements for the use of the BOS funds as stipulated in the operational guidelines
Usually schools could finalize their RAPBS after having several consultations with the local education office and discussions with other schools, especially with schools that were already familiar with the preparation of RAPBS
Schools in the urban area usually consulted directly with the kota education office, while schools in kabupaten areas consulted with the UPTD
To undertake this consultation, the schools located in remote areas had to spend a significant cost for transportation
In addition, the consultation took the time of the school principals or the teaching time of the teachers who were assigned to this task
In the context of assisting schools in preparing the RAPBS, several satker or local education office issued special policies
The Provincial Satker of East Java, for example, requested the kabupaten/kota satker to provide guidance on the preparation of the RAPBS to school principals and treasurers in stages in each kecamatan
In Kabupaten Malang, this appeal was implemented through socializing and explaining the preparation of the RAPBS to the UPTD, which then undertook the same task for schools in their respective working areas
In North Sumatra, this effort was at the planning stage
In a workshop at the provincial level, there was a discussion on the possibility of conducting training on the preparation of the RAPBS simultaneously with a simple bookkeeping for primary school teachers as one of the 2006 programs to be funded by the provincial DIPA
The education office of Kota Pematang Siantar had also planned to conduct the socialization activity and training on the preparation of the RAPBS
Meanwhile, Kabupaten Tapanuli Utara obtained assistance from the USAID in the form of training on school development planning, including the preparation of the RAPBS and mediumterm plans, for approximately 50 schools
Apart from the weakness of not being able to prepare the RAPBS, schools were not engaging, or facilitated very little involvement of, teachers, school committees, and parents in RAPBS development
In most cases, the school principal with the involvement of the BOS treasurer prepared the school budget
Teachers who were involved in the preparation of the RAPBS were usually only the teachers who were appointed as the BOS treasurer by the school principal
Other teachers just knew of the RAPBS at the time of the school meeting with the school committee and parents to discuss the BOS and the plans for its use
In some cases, there were several schools that involved some teachers in the preparation of RAPBS
This was found more often in junior high schools than in the primary level
It seems that the size of the funding has impacted on the number of teachers involved
At the junior high school level, there were some schools that formed a special committee to manage BOS funds starting from the RAPBS preparation
In addition, there were also schools that involved several senior teachers with certain positions in determining the use of the BOS funds
Usually, school committees, which were represented by their head of the committee, only contributed in signing the RAPBS that had already been prepared by the school principal, because it was required by the program, without real involvement in the preparation process
Most school committees did not have a copy of the RAPBS, but could obtain it if they asked for it from the school
In the preparation of the RAPBS in private schools, which some did not have school committees, there were schools that involved the foundation and some that did not
In schools that did not involve the foundation, the school only informed the foundation of the existence of the BOS funds and the plan for their use
According to the program operational guidelines, the elements of the RAPBS consisted of the types and amount of school revenues to be obtained, as well as the type and amount of planned expenditure
Most sample schools included all revenue sources in the budget, both from BOS and from other sources
However, there were several schools that only put in the revenues from BOS, without including the revenues from other sources
As to the determination of the types of expenditure or use of the funds, schools more often referred to the funds utilization that were permitted in the operational guidelines, rather than the actual needs of the school
Several schools only prepared a budget that contained the overall revenues and expenditures while other schools completed the RAPBS with details on the types of expenses
The types of use that were included were, in general, decided by the school principal, and in only few schools was this also based on the inputs from teachers
The types of use that were included in the RAPBS for BOS funds and their details refer to the 11 types of uses of the BOS funds permitted in the operational guidelines (see Table 1.2)
Withdrawal of Funds from School Accounts The operational guidelines only determined that the withdrawal of the BOS funds could be done by the person in charge the activity under the auspices of the school principal and the approval of the head of the school committee
The withdrawal could be done at any time according to the need, and by leaving a minimum balance in accordance with the regulation
So, the withdrawal could be done in the same manner as the withdrawal of funds from regular savings at the bank/post office, which was by taking a passbook and completing a withdrawal form
The operational guidelines did not impose other requirements such as the financial reports, stipulations on the amount of funds that could be taken in a withdrawal and the frequency of withdrawals by the school
Nevertheless, in the implementation, several regions established certain requirements for the withdrawal of funds
In North Sumatra and North Sulawesi, the provincial and kabupaten/kota satker did not impose special requirements regarding the withdrawals of funds
Schools were treated the same as other regular bank customers, so in withdrawing funds they only brought with them a passbook and completed a withdrawal form
In East Java, Banten and NTB, however, for surveillance purpose, the kabupaten/kota satker imposed additional requirements for funds withdrawals from school's accounts
This imposition is possible because in these three provinces, school's accounts were kept in the appointed channeling institutions
The requirements that were brought into effect were, among others, that the RAPBS or an SPJ (accountability report) for the use of the funds had to be enclosed
In addition, the withdrawals were also controlled so that the funds could not be withdrawn at once, but had to be withdrawn several times or once per month
In East Java, schools had to have RAPBS as a requirement for the first withdrawal of BOS funds
For the following withdrawals, the education office obliged schools to submit an SPJ of the previous month withdrawal that had been checked by the kabupaten/kota education office
When the education office agreed to this SPJ, the school was provided with a ‘kitir' (coupon) that could be used to withdraw the funds
In this kitir, there was a stamp of the amount of funds that could be obtained by the school for a particular month
In Banten, the post office and the provincial satker agreed that at the time of the first withdrawal of the funds, each school had to bring the RAPBS, a copy of the letter of appointment of the school principal and the treasurer, their identification card, the school seal and they had to fill in giro slips 1, 3, and 9
For the following withdrawals, there were differences in the requirements between Kota Cilegon and Kabupaten Lebak
In Cilegon, schools had to submit the SPJ for the use of the funds that had been withdrawn previously
In Kabupaten Lebak, schools were only required to submit the plans for the use of the funds to be withdrawn, while the SPJ itself was reported quarterly
In NTB, schools had to obtain a letter of recommendation from the local education office or UPTD as a requirement for obtaining funds on the first occasion
For the following withdrawals, schools had to submit the SPJ for the funds already used, as it was required in Kota Cilegon
The preparation of the SPJ was usually supervised by the kabupaten/kota satker, so the schools often had to go back and forth to revise the SPJ document based on the corrections made by the satker
This process took ample of time and cost because schools had to go back and forth to meet the satker or go to the local education office
Although the special requirement for withdrawing the funds was undertaken with the aim that the use of the funds would be better controlled, this policy tended to create more bureaucracy as well as consume more time and money
The operational guidelines required that withdrawals of the BOS funds be done with the approval of the head of the school committee
Nevertheless, because there was no stipulation or other requirement that accompanied it, most schools did not include or request the approval of the school committee in the withdrawal of funds
Of all the schools visited during this study, only one school in Pematang Siantar followed this stipulation in the withdrawal of BOS funds
This is because the school used their old school account that had been previously used for the Basic Education Project (BEP) Program
This account was signed by the school principal and committee treasurer, so for each withdrawal, the committee treasurer had to accompany the school principal
The imposition of additional requirements for the withdrawal of BOS funds also impacted the frequency and stages of the withdrawals
In North Sumatra, whose satker did not impose a particular requirement for funds withdrawals, several schools that have few students tended to withdraw all funds in a single withdrawal
While in East Java, Banten and NTB, the withdrawals were done in stages, because of the requirements described above
In East Java, funds were withdrawn every month, except for the first withdrawal, which took three months allocation
In Banten, the satker and the post office suggested that the schools make a minimum of two withdrawals, whereas, in NTB, the satker stipulated that schools withdraw funds every quarter of a year
The requirement for schools to withdraw funds every certain period of time for a particular amount was considered inappropriate because the needs of schools each month are not always the same
In addition, there is quite a risk if the funds are not immediately used because their security is not guaranteed, especially for schools that obtained the BOS funds in large amounts
In the technical and operational guidelines, there was no stipulation on the time limit for withdrawals and the use of the funds
Nevertheless, because the schools received BOS funds in accordance with the RAPBS for a semester, many schools thought that the funds had to be taken and spent before the completion of the relevant semester
This lack of clarity caused schools to spend the funds before the semester ended, although the expenditure was actually not in need
For that reason, by the end of December, most schools had withdrawn all their funds and left behind only the interest on the savings or the minimum savings balance
All sample schools received the full entitlement to the funds in accordance with the allocation that had been determined
In each funds withdrawal, the schools were never levied with any deductions or asked to pay anything
The time needed for each withdrawal was also relatively fast, in much the same manner as the withdrawal of savings in general
2.4.2 Utilization of Funds The opinion of various parties regarding the stipulated 11 types of uses of the BOS funds varied, however, they mostly considered that these stipulations were too restrictive (limited) because they did not accommodate all of the needs of the schools
Several kinds of expenses that were usually funded by school tuitions but could not be funded by the BOS funds included
the incentives for school principals, deputy principals, and homeroom teachers; the transportation allowances for permanent teachers; teachers' refreshments; and the construction of school infrastructure
The stipulation on the uses of funds stated in the 2005 operational guidelines was also considered unclear, and therefore caused diverse interpretations
The differences in interpretation at the school level were, in general, influenced by the interpretation of the kabupaten/kota satker that were presented to the schools during the socialization event or consultation on the RAPBS and the usage of the funds
For an example, in Tapanuli Utara and Pematang Siantar, the BOS funds were not allowed to be used to purchase computers, chairs, and tables, because they were not considered consumables
In other regions, however, those kinds of expenditures were allowed because they were deemed as part of the costs of student activities or in the interests of teaching and learning process
In practice, the use of the BOS funds that were mostly managed by the school principal with the assistance of the BOS treasurer was not always in accordance with the RAPBS and the 11 stipulated uses stated in the 2005 operational guidelines
Most schools adapted the uses of the funds to the needs of the schools although some were not in accordance with the regulations
Their reason was that the school had to fulfill some particular needs that until now had been funded by the school tuitions
Based on the accountability reports of the BOS funds in the sample schools, the biggest proportion of the BOS funds was spent for the payment of teachers' honorariums, teaching and learning activities (KBM), procurement of stationery (ATK) and purchase of textbooks
The payment of teachers' honorariums took place in all sample schools
Quite a large proportion of payments for teachers' honorariums were fpund in private schools because almost all teachers in these schools were not civil servants (PNS)
In total, payments of teachers' honorariums were the type of expenditure that took up most of the BOS funds
In approximately 83% of the sample BOS recipient schools, the payment of teachers' honorariums was included in the top five of expenditure types (see Table 2.5)
Unlike in other districts, however, in two samples of kabupaten/kota in North Sulawesi, there were only three schools that had payments for teachers' honorariums included in the top five expenditure types
This happened because there were only a few teachers paid by honorarium in the sample schools in this district
The KBM also consumed quite a lot of the BOS funds, and in 70% of the sample schools it was included in the top five types of funding
The large proportion of these KBM costs was, inter alia, because the KBM consisted of several funding units, including the costs of semester and daily tests, skills practices, student affairs activities, and upgrading courses/seminars
Meanwhile, the tendency of schools to purchase textbooks had as its own background; among the reasons were, for the needs of the school/students, the suggestion of the local education office, and also the offers of incentives from publishers or book shops in the form of price rebates in the range of 10–20% of the sales price
The textbooks being purchased usually became the property of the school library and were lent to each student for a certain period of time
The lending period of books varied between schools
There were some books that were only given out during school hours and some others were allowed to be taken home for one semester or one academic year
Although many parties complained about the regulation on the use of the BOS funds that they could not be used to pay for the incentives of principals and permanent teachers, this study found that in reality the incomes of school principals and teachers, both teachers' paid by honorarium and permanent teachers, tended to increase after the BOS
This increase occurred because most schools issued a policy to raise the salary of the teachers paid by honorarium and the overtime compensation for all teachers
Although overtime compensation in several schools/districts was not allowed to be funded by the BOS funds, several schools could still use the funds by clasifying the overtime payment into other expenditure items
At the same time, in schools that followed the regulations, this type of expenditure could still be increased as long as the school was still charging school tuition from the students
The increase in the teachers' income could also be obtained from several other expenditure items, such as, from the expenditure for the KBM and the enhancement of the quality of teachers through the MGMP activities in junior high schools and the KKG activities in primary schools
In the KBM expenditure item, especially the daily and semester test activities, teachers receive honorarium for the preparation of test questions, as well as for administrating test and examining test results 
Whereas according to the technical guidelines for the BOS finances, for test-related activities, the BOS funds can be used for the procurement or provision of materials/goods and there is no statement in the guidelines which mentions that the BOS funds can also be used for teachers' honorariums for preparing test problems, administrating tests, and examining test results
As from the MGMP and the KKG activities, teachers received transportation and refreshments allowances, and pocket money
Although these activities were intended to enhance the quality of teachers, problems could arise if the implementation was not well supervised
For example, in one of the sample schools in North Sumatra, there were MGMP receipts that had been signed only by one teacher
The relevant school principal acknowledged that MGMP in this school had only been done internally, whereas the number of teachers for this particular subject was very limited
This raises the question as to how the enhancement of teacher quality, which should be achieved through interactions between teachers, could come about
Among the top five expenditure items that were funded by the BOS, it appeared that the expenditure specifically allocated to provide special assistance to poor students was very small
Only in four schools was the special allocation for poor students included in the top five allocations of the BOS funds, and it ranged between 9.2 and 19.8%
In other schools that also provide special assistance for poor students, the funds allocated were relatively small so they were not included in the top five expenditure items
In regard to the use of the BOS funds, it was found that several parties had made an attempt to obtain a personal gain by abusing their influence to persuade the procurement of particular goods (Box 2.2)
In addition, this study also found the possibility for duplications to occur in the allocations of BOS funds and the allocation of funds from other sources
The duplication of expenses could occur because most schools received funds from various sources and not all funding sources required reports accompanied by evidence of receipts for expenditure
The regulations on the use of funds from various sources could also be the same, so the funds could be used for the same expenditure groups
Among the funding sources that were received by schools were school tuitions for schools that still levied them, funding from the regional government budgets (APBD), other educational programs, and from the foundations for private schools that were managed by a foundation
Several funding sources such as the BOS, the APBD for Operational Costs (BOP), and school tuitions could be used for paying school operational costs
Although, according to the requirements of the BOS Program, the RAPBS and the financial reports had to include all sources of school revenues, it appeared that the RAPBS and the financial reports of some schools only contained the BOS revenue
In almost all schools, the availability of the BOS funds increased the school revenues
With this increase in revenue, it should have been easier for schools to manage their costs
The results of interviews with schools uncovered, however, that several schools were definitely confused in managing the funding allocation, especially for the BOS revenues in the second and subsequent semesters
This confusion happened because these schools usually obtained very small revenue from school tuitions
Apart from this, the regulations that limited the types of use of the funds made it less flexible for schools in managing school expenses
Meanwhile, the BOS revenue in the first semester of the 2005-2006 academic year has fulfilled all types of expenditure permitted by the operational guidelines and the local satker
Most of these schools had not yet even thought about a strategy or plan for enhancing the quality and facilities of teaching and learning activities in the medium to long-term, after receiving additional revenues from the BOS funds
2.4.3 Savings Interest and Payment of Taxes In all schools, the BOS funds were kept in the schools' savings accounts for quite some time, both because schools intentionally plan to withdraw them in stages in accordance with their needs and because there was a regulation on the withdrawal of funds that had been stipulated by the provincial and kabupaten/kota satker
With the exception of Banten, where school giro accounts at the post office do not give interests, the money in school savings will receive savings interest
As a consequence, the treatment of this entitlement to saving interests varied between regions
However, not all the BOS managers knew about this regulation because it had not been well informed
Moreover, not all the banks that were appointed as the channeling institutions for the BOS funds and where schools opened bank accounts knew about this regulation
Due to the unclear understanding of schools, the payment of tax varied
Regarding the tax on teachers' honorariums, several schools paid tax of all types of teachers' incomes, both the incomes for teachers paid by honorarium and other teachers' incentives, including the ones for MGMP or KKG activities and the test-related incomes
There were also schools that only imposed and paid tax for teachers' paid by honorarium, while other teachers' incentives were not levied tax
Meanwhile, for the payment of purchases or procurements of goods above Rp1 million, there were more variations, which were the payment of tax of 1.5%, 5%, 10% or even 11.5%
At the beginning of the program implementation, most schools felt that the process and management of tax payments were more onerous compared with the value of the tax that had to be paid
This is because almost all schools did not know about the regulations and mechanism of tax payment
Besides that, the tax levy that has to be paid is relatively small, except for schools that receive the BOS funds in rather large amounts and use the large proportion of it only on several types of expenditures
When making payments, schools had to go to at least two agencies, the post office or the government bank to pay the tax, and the tax office to deliver proof that the tax has been paid
In several regions, the local tax office had not even known about the tax obligation in regard to the BOS funds so they could not provide an adequate guidance (Box 2.3)
For the majority of schools that are quite far from the post office and the tax office that is usually located in the capital city of the kabupaten/kota, the distance and time also became an obstacle
As a result of these various obstacles, as of the end of the first semester, there were still many schools that had not yet fulfilled their tax obligation, although they had already left aside the funds
In addition, there were also a lot of schools that made an attempt to avoid the payment of tax by manipulating the value or the payment receipt
Of the schools that made procurements of more than Rp1 million, there were some that tried to break down the receipt into several receipts
Each receipt was valued below Rp1 million, so for the purchase of one type of goods of high value, there could be dozens of receipts
This was, indeed, quite beneficial for the schools
Of each Rp1 million, schools could save Rp15,000
Furthermore, schools could also save time, labor and transportation cost for the tax payment
However, the attempt to avoid the tax obligation is of course considered dishonest and inconsistent with the moral responsibility of education
2.5 REPORTING Based on the 2005 operational guidelines, program implementers at the center, province, kabupaten/kota and school levels were obligated to report their activities to associated parties
The issues that had to be reported by the managers at each level were as follows
- Center and province
statistics of the program recipients, reports on the absorption of program funds, reports on the results of monitoring and evaluation, reports on the handling of complaints, reports on other activities (including socialization and training) and a final report that contained all activities related with the planning and implementation of the program; - Kabupaten/kota
statistics on program recipients, reports on the outcome of assistance, results of monitoring and evaluation, and reports on complaints; - Schools
the names of students who received the assistance, the amount of funds managed by school and a report on the use of funds, a record of questions/ criticisms/suggestions, and a record of complaints
At the time of this study, the reports that had been prepared in most regions were the reports on the recipients of assistance, especially related to the funding allocation, the data on the number of students, and the schools that received BOS, as well as the reports on the program preparation that covered the activities in the socialization
There were not, as yet, reports on the results of monitoring and evaluation because most of the monitoring activity had just been conducted in January-February 2006
Reports on the use/benefits of the assistance from the kabupaten/kota to the province have not yet been made because the kabupaten/kota satker had not yet recapitulated the reports from schools
Most schools already submitted a report on the use of the funds, but there were several schools that still had to revise their report
Besides that, the reports on the handling of community complaints, at the school, kabupaten/kota, and provincial levels in all sample regions had not been composed
The reports on the handling of community complaints and monitoring and evaluation will be discussed in Sub-section 2.6
This subsection only discusses the report on the use/benefits of the BOS funds
In particular, the following discussion will present the step-by-step reporting mechanism that was implemented in various sample regions, the problems that were faced by schools in preparing the financial reports, and the issue of transparency of the schools report on the use of the funds
2.5.1 Reporting Mechanism According to the operational guidelines, the reporting of the revenue and the use of BOS funds should be made in steps, starting from school level up to the Central Satker
The reports prepared by the schools should be submitted to the kabupaten/kota satker
The kabupaten/kota satker then wrote a report on the implementation of the program and submitted it to the provincial satker
Finally, the provincial satker compiled it and submitted the report to the Central Satker
As of early March 2006, the provincial satker had composed and reported technical preparation activities and the list of schools that received BOS funds to the Central Satker
The preparation that was undertaken by the provincial satker included meetings in the context of data validation, socialization, formation of a technical team, and related institutional arrangements
In addition, the provincial satker also sent the BOS funding allocations for each kabupaten/kota as well as a report on the distribution of funds to all schools based on the report from the appointed channeling institutions, which were the banks or the post offices
The flow of reports in the sample regions of this study was quite varied, but the general illustration of the flow of these reports is presented in Figure 2.4
The provincial satker periodically obtained the report on financial transactions of the satker account from the bank/post office and this reporting was running smoothly and reliable
The reports from the channeling institutions varied between provinces
As presented in the sub-section on the absorption of funds, the channeling institutions in the provinces of Banten, East Java and NTB regularly reported the absorption of funds and/or the withdrawal of funds from schools' bank accounts, in addition to the financial transactions of the provincial satker
In East Java, specifically, Bank Jatim also provided a report on the financial transactions of the account of the Kabupaten/Kota education office, because the BOS funds from the province were tranfered to this account before distributed to school accounts
Meanwhile in North Sumatra and North Sulawesi provinces, the channeling institutions (Bank Sumut and BRI) only provided a report on the distribution of funds to school accounts and the financial transactions of the account of the provincial satker
These two banks could not report the withdrawals of funds from each school's account because the schools were free to open their account at any bank, so their transactions were out of their monitoring coverage
In regard to the reports on the use of BOS funds, schools submitted reports to the kabupaten/kota satker
Schools in urban area usually sent their report directly to the office of the kota satker, while schools in the kabupaten, especially primary schools, usually submit their report through the UPTD that was located in their respective kecamatan
The relatively far distance to the office of the kabupaten satker did call for the role of UPTD as an intermediary between schools and kabupaten satker
In Banten, in addition to the UPTD, the kecamatan post office could also function as an intermediary in the delivery of this report
Religious schools (MI, MTs and salafiyah), in addition to having to send an accountability report to the kabupaten/kota satker, also had to send the report to the office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs
The kabupaten/kota satker has to send reports to the provincial satker
At the time of this study, the reports that had been submitted by the kabupaten/kota satker were the reports on the preparation of the program and the statistics of the BOS recipients in the form of initial data on schools and the number of student that received BOS
Subsequently, the provincial satker prepared a report on the implementation of the program to be sent to the Central Satker
At the same time, the kabupaten/kota office of Ministry of Religious Affairs that supervised madrasah and salafiyah schools also prepared a report on the implementation of the program to be sent to the provincial office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, with a copy to be sent to the kabupaten/kota satker
The provincial office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs also prepared a report to be submitted to the head office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, with a copy submitted to the provincial satker
The submission of duplicate reports from religious schools and the Ministry of Religious Affairs offices tended to reduce the efficiency of the joint-management approach of BOS Program
2.5.2 Reports Preparation at the School Level The operational guidelines determined that the reporting by schools should be done every quarter, semester, and year
The reports had to include the RAPBS, a copy of the bank account, and a report on the cashbook as well as evidences of expenditure
To make it easy for schools to prepare the report, the operational guidelines provided a template for the report
The BOS-K1 was for preparing the RAPBS, the BOS-K2 for detailing the uses of the funds for each type of expenses and BOS-K3 for making a cashbook
With these examples, it was expected that schools would not have any difficulty in preparing the financial reports
This appraisal found that the reporting period in the sample regions varied depending on the stipulations of the satker in each region
In East Java, NTB and Banten, the provincial satker determined that schools had to make a quarterly report
As presented in the section on funds disbursement, in these three provinces, for the withdrawals of funds in the following stages, schools were required to submit an accountability report (SPJ) on the funds that had been withdrawn
For that reason, in East Java, for example, the SPJ report had to be prepared on a monthly basis
Contrary, in the other two sample provinces, North Sumatra and North Sulawesi, the financial accountability report was only prepared at the end of the semester, the majority of which were late and had just been completed in February 2006
The policy on the reporting schedule was affected with the delay of the funding disbursement in these two provinces
The BOS funds in these two provinces were received by the schools at the end of September, so the reports could not be made in accordance with the schedule determined in the operational guidelines
According to the majority of schools, preparing a detailed report on the use of the funds by budget type was quite complicated and time consuming
This was caused by schools having to report the use of funds exactly in accordance with the operational guidelines, which was not always the same as how the funds are actually used
The difficulty in synchronizing the real uses of the funds with the expenditure items that were permitted by the operational guidelines, and the limited understanding of schools on the requirements for the use of the BOS funds, have resulted in the reports being revised several times
To provide details on the use of funds by budget item, schools were forced to modify the report so that it was in accordance with the regulation, and their supervisory agencies or other parties that would audit the program would not blame them
For example, the funds used for ‘building MCK9 facilities' was reported as being used for ‘minor building maintenance'
The payment of ‘permanent teachers allowances' was changed to ‘procurement of ATK'
In other words, schools were forced to manipulate the reports, an act which is not proper for educators to do
To overcome difficulties in the report preparation, schools usually consulted the education office or the staff of the Ministry of Religious Affairs office, both at the kecamatan and kabupaten/kota levels
Several schools took the initiative to request the kabupaten/kota satker to arrange training on report preparation
In East Java, the education office of Kota Pasuruan arranged training on preparing SPJ that was conducted over three days
In addition, the local city satker also scheduled consultations time for schools between 12.00 and 17.00
In other regions, the kabupaten/kota satker stated that consultations could be undertaken at any time
However, it appears that when schools came for a consultation, the satker officers, especially the program manager, were not present although the visit was made during working hours
For consulting the report, schools had to incur a cost, at least for transportation
A salafiyah in Banten, for example, needed to expend transportation costs of between Rp 50,000 and Rp 100,000 for each consultation
Several other schools also incurred costs for typing and printing reports, although there was actually no regulation that reports had to be printed
In addition, schools also complained about the amount of time that was needed to prepare this report
They needed to spend time to go back and forth (between three and ten times) to the education office to revise the report
For that, they often lost their private time because they had to do overtime or were forced to use their teaching hours
Although most schools still experienced difficulty in preparing the report on the first phase of this program, it appeared that some schools that had participated in assistance programs, such as the DBEP, did not experience any difficulties
These schools were able to prepare their financial report because in the DBEP they had been trained in preparing financial reports on the use of funds
Several schools that received assistance from these programs informally ‘spread' their knowledge on how to prepare reports, including the accountability reports on the use of BOS funds, to other schools
2.5.3 The Transparency of School Reporting Report on the use of funds was usually prepared by the school principal and the BOS treasurer, and then they submitted it to the kabupaten/kota satker
There were, however, schools whose reports were only prepared by the school principal without the involvement of the treasurer
If there was a teacher involved, it was usually only the teacher who had been appointed as BOS treasurer, while other teachers were not involved
Most teachers also did not know the content of the report although most of them knew that the principal and the BOS treasurer were preparing or had prepared the report
Nevertheless, they did not object to it because, apart from the fact that the principal acts like a “small king” in the school and, therefore determining tearchers promotion, there was also a fact that the BOS funds had have real impact on various aspects such as the availability of school facilities
The school committees, which were supposed to be the partner of the school, were generally not involved in the report preparation
Moreover, several of them did not know of the existence of the BOS report at the school level, although they signed the RAPBS early in the program implementation
There were only a limited number of school committees that could access the report
They were usually school committees that were active in visiting schools
In general, the school only provided information to parents that the school is a BOS Program recipient
It was rarely found that the school reported the use of funds to parents in detail
Several schools, especially in East Java, reported the use of the funds verbally to the students' parent at the time when the student evaluation reports were distributed
The SMERU team only found two schools that delivered the report openly to parents
One school placed the summary report on the use of the BOS funds on the school notice board, so whoever was visiting the school had access to the information on the realization of the use of the funds
There was another school that invited representatives of parents and delivered a verbal report to them and, in turn, they were expected to tell other parents about the information
Although still limited in their scope, these two means could certainly provide models for other schools in their effort to ensure transparency in the management of funds in schools
It is unfortunate that the program's operational guidelines only regulated the reporting mechanism from schools to satker and did not oblige schools to report the use of funds openly to parents and the general public
Because there was no such requirement, many schools did not consider that is was necessary to present the report to the parents
Although most schools were not transparent, most parents did not make an issue of whether there was a report on the use of the BOS funds or not
It seemed that parents ‘did not care' about administrative issues with the use of the funds
They tended to believe that schools were using the funds properly
Many of the parents were apathetic because, even if the schools delivered the report, they usually did not provide a positive response if the parents were critical
In addition, the disinterest of parents was also encouraged by the facts that they felt the benefits of the BOS funds in the forms of the exemption from or reduction in school tuition and from the cost savings on the purchase of textbooks
Parents, in general, hoped that with the BOS funds there would no longer be an obligation to pay school tuition, as informed through the media (radio/television), or to purchase textbooks
2.6 MONITORING, EVALUATION, AND COMPLAINTS HANDLING In the operational guidelines for the 2005 BOS Program, it was stated that the monitoring and evaluation (monev) of the program would be conducted internally and externally
The technical guidedlines on monev highlighted the aim of the monev activity as providing the basis and information for decision making in the context of refining the program, encouraging transparency and accountability among program managers as well as enhancing the quality of program managers' performance
The program implementers conducted internal monev
In the structure of the satker at the central, provincial, and kabupaten/kota levels, there is a monev section that consists of elements from the Ministry of National Education/education offices and the Ministry of Religious Affairs
This internal monev section had the task of undertaking observation, supervision, guidance, and problem resolution
Program components that were monitored included
(i) allocations of funds of recipient schools; (ii) the distribution and absorption of funds; (iii) community complaints and service provision; (iv) financial administration; and (v) reporting
External monitoring, according to 2005 the operational guidelines, was considered part of supervision
According to these guidelines, external monitoring and evaluation for the PKPS BBM Education Sector Program (BOS and BKM) could be conducted by competent supervisory institutions, including
1
Independent monitoring teams
higher education institutions, the DPR, BIN10 or special government-appointed independent teams; 2
the education councils, NGOs, BMPS11 and other education/community organizations; 3
Supervisory agencies
BPK, BPKP, General Inspectorate (Irjen), and the provincial and kabupaten/kota Regional Inspectorate Board (Bawasda); 4
Community complaints units in schools/madrasah, kabupaten/kota, provinces and central government
In general, this study found several weaknesses in the system and implementation of monev that had been developed to safeguard the program
According to many parties, internal monev was still unsatisfactory, while external monev was not effective enough
The quality of the implementation of internal monev was still in question and gave more of an impression of being conducted just for formality
Meanwhile, the external monev was too open, so too many parties, including parties that were not competent and irresponsible, could conduct it
Furthermore, there was not yet a system that could compatibly combine internal monev and external monev so the results could effectively safeguard the program and provide inputs for sustainable program improvements
For that reason, many schools questioned the effectiveness of the monev activity, both the one undertaken by the satker (internal) and the one by parties outside the satker (external)
The results of the monev activity did not provide ‘feedback' for schools and other management institutions useful enough to improve the implementation of the program
Moreover, in fact in several regions, some irresponsible parties utilized the monev to obtain personal gains
The weaknesses in this monev system also impacted on the weakness in the complaints handling system that was one of the tasks of the internal and external monev
This study uncovered that the system for receiving and handling complaints was still not well organized, although many parties had been involved
The discussion below provides an explanation on the implementation of the monev and the complaints handling in the sample regions of the study in more detail
2.6.1 Implementation of Monitoring and Evaluation Internal Monev Up to the time this study was conducted, there were no sample kabupaten that had a report on the internal monev result
In most cases, the provincial satker as well as the kabupaten/kota satker carried out monitoring of the implementation of the BOS through a routine mechanism and sporadically made visits or inspections if there were complaints
Not all regions were undertaking special internal monev activities
Four sample kabupaten/kota that have conducted internal monev through the use of questionnaires were Kabupaten Lebak, Kabupaten Tapanuli Utara, Kabupaten Lombok Tengah, and Kota Pasuruan, but the data was still being processed
In Kabupaten Lebak, questionnaires were distributed to sample schools through the UPTD and the kecamatan office of Ministry of Religious Affairs
In Kabupaten Tapanuli Utara, questionnaires were distributed to all schools through the UPTD
In Kabupaten Lombok Tengah, questionnaires were also distributed to all schools, but the schools were invited to the UPTD office to fill in the questionnaires, so the UPTD did not actually visit the schools
In Kota Pasuruan the monev was rather more in-depth
The monitoring was undertaken through the UPTD and it involved school supervisors
The scope of the monitoring included all schools and the respondents consisted of a member of the school committee, a teacher, three students and three parents
The conduct of this monev was generally late because of the late distribution of funds for the monev that had been budgeted through the Ministry of Religious Affairs
Apart from the monev funding that was considered too little, the monev activity in several regions was impeded by the difficulty in the coordination between the education office and the office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs
In several regions the cooperation on monev between the staff of the education office and the Ministry of Religious Affairs office ran well
In several other regions, however, the education office was more active in conducting the monev activities, while the staff of the Depag office were considered less active
This gave rise to jealousy and rumors about the lack of transparency of the Ministry of Religious Affairs offices in managing monev funds
Because of these various factors, the internal monev activity was in general considered inadequate
Many parties felt that monev activities were carried out as a formality in adherence to the regulations for the management of the program
The data collection was not reliable, for example, because it was found that the monev officials did not make direct visit to schools, but only waited for the school principals to come to the education office at the kecamatan level
In addition, the results have not yet be used as the basis for policy making because the completed questionnaires that were collected were only kept at the office of the satker or the Ministry of Religious Affairs officed without being processed and analyzed, and it was not yet known when the report will be finalized
External Monev In all sample regions, many institutions conducted monev with different qualities, depths and scopes
Several non-government institutions such as the education councils, NGOs, BMPS, the mass media, and some mass organizations, as well as some regional government supervisory elements such as the Bawasda, the Irjen, and the DPRD, were among the institutions that had undertaken the monitoring since BOS Program commenced
In addition, at the time of this study, the BPKP was also undertaking financial audit in several sample schools
All the institutions outside the satker were strategic partners of the satker's monev section in conducting investigations, facts finding, and resolving various corruption cases
If necessary, the internal and external monev are expected to provide recommendations on sanctions to the police (legal sanctions) or regional heads (administrative sanctions) for proven acts of corruption
Among the various institutions that undertook the monev, most of them did not undertake the activity in a well-structured and coordinated way
Quite a lot of institutions visited schools directly, without the knowledge of the satker and clear reporting system
the results of their supervision were not informed or reported to the satker at any level
Only a few institutions such as the BPKP, Bawasda, DPRD, education councils, higher education institutions and NGOs who were quite competent, communicated and coordinated with the satker or the education office
The BPKP conducted audits directly and they were facilitated by the provincial and kabupaten/kota satker
The Bawasda and the DPRD in almost all sample regions also coordinated with the satker in conducting supervision to follow up reports or community complaints
In addition, the education council in Kabupaten Tapanuli Utara, an NGO in North Sumatra, and Muhammadiyah University in Malang, for example, also conducted an independent monev in their respective regions, which was well designed, and their results were also submitted to the satker and other related institutions
With a number of institutions participating in supervising the implementation of the program, all program managers, especially at the school level, became very careful and attempted to follow the program regulations
On the one hand, this had a positive impact and suppressed the opportunities for corruption; but, on the other hand, it also generated a lot of fear among program managers at the school level
In almost all places, however, there was veiled extortion in the “supervision” activity that was conducted by unscrupulous journalists or others who claimed to come from NGOs
Several schools that were visited by these people were eventually forced to give money for transportation or food to them
Although the value of the money given to each was not large, for schools that were visited by many, the total amount of money became quite large
In addition, because many institutions visited the schools, it had disturbed the teaching and learning activities and took up the time of the school principal
A lot of the information that was given by unscrupulous person also appeared to have been inaccurate, so a lot of confusion arose, especially as the schools did not yet have a good understanding on the various program regulations
There was also a concern in particular regions that the supervision conducted by DPRD members had political intentions and was used as a means to pressure the replacement of the school principal
Considering the large scale of the program, the potential for corruption of the funds and the diversity of the roles of program managers from the central to the kabupaten/kota levels, the presence of an external monitoring unit was quite important
However, various factors that were found in the field have shown the inefficiency of the external monitoring system that had been operating
The existing system did indeed guarantee the access of the community in general through various institutions, but it appeared to be very vulnerable in that the monev activity was likely to be misused by some irresponsible parties
Compared with the external monitoring system that was introduced by the CIMU (Central Independent Monitoring Unit) at the time of the JPS (Social Safety Net) Program for the Education Sector in the past, the existing external supervisory system is not effective enough to guarantee the link between the results of the monitoring and the effort to systematically improve the program performance at various levels, from the central to the school levels
2.6.2 Complaints and Problems Resolution As explained in the early part of this sub-section, according to the design of BOS Program, complaints handling was an integral part of the monev system that consisted of internal and external monev
Therefore, complaints could be submitted to the satker at various levels, to the schools and to various institutions that conducted external monev
According to the stipulations of the program's operational guidelines, the monev section as well as the schools had to document the complaints, the follow up of the complaints handling by type of case, the scale of the case, and the status of resolution based on the template provided in the operational guidelines
It appeared that in all sample regions of this study, the complaints cases and their resolutions were not well documented at any management level
Only in the Mapenda section of the regional office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs in East Java was there a complaints report
In this document, a number of complaints were reported, with information on each case, including the origin of the complaint, the subject of the complaint, the content of the complaint, and the follow-up to the complaint
The follow-up column, however, only contained a letter of order from the head of the regional office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs to the lower level agencies to conduct a field check, and there was no information on the status of resolution of these complaints
In several other provinces and kabupaten/kota, the satker only had a clipping of newspaper reports on various complaints and other issues that were associated with BOS Program, including various socialization activities
Without adequate documentation, information on the types of complaints and the means as well as the handling of the complaints could only be obtained from newspaper clippings and interviews with various parties who received or handled the complaint
From these various sources, it can be discovered that among the various issues of complaint, most were associated with the transparency in the use of BOS funds in schools and the imposition of (additional) tuitions from students
These issues were generally brought up by the community and teachers
Other complaints such as the late distribution of funds by the bank and provincial satker, the system of accountability reporting that tended to burden schools, additional requirements for fund withdrawal, the manipulation of student numbers, and the inconsistency between the funding allocation received and the number of students, were the subject of complaints that were often expressed by schools
In addition, some local media that was compiled also revealed a number of issues, such as the insensitivity of the government in cases of corruption of the BOS funds that was allegedly done by a member of Commission X of the DPR,12 the case where the name of the bupati was profiteered in order to receive the BOS funds,13 and the reports on the possible misuse of the BOS funds in Tapanuli Utara
Complaints about the collection of tuitions from students were often not well responded because they were considered to be parents' lack of understanding on the program requirements
In Kota Mataram, for example, the local satker argued that the decision to increase tuitions or levies were based on the agreement of the school committee that represented the interests of parents or the community so they felt that they did not have the right to intervene, let alone cancel the decision
Unfortunately, not infrequently, this kind of decision was a unilateral decision that was taken by the school principal or school committee that was not appointed through an election or was chosen by groups of wealthy parents at the school
In almost all implementation phases, the research team found several problems that actually could have been used as complaint subjects
However, these problems, such as the cases of the non-fulfillment of promises by channeling institutions to distribute funds directly to schools and the regulations on the purchase of textbooks, were not being brought up as a complaint either by the schools that were the party being disadvantaged or by program managers at the kabupaten/kota level
In general, the complaints submission and handling process can be categorized into three groups, namely
(i) complaints via satker, (ii) complaints via schools, and (iii) complaints via external monev
(i) Complaints through the Satker Conceptually, the complaints and problem handling was the responsibility and authority of the monev section, which was under the control of the satker
This status is conflicting with the principles of objectivity and independence of the efforts to conduct fact finding, investigate, and resolve, the complaints and problems of the suspected program misuse
Who would have the authority to conduct investigations if the complaint is about the performance of the program managers
Could the monev section be neutral and independent in doing the fact-finding activities or investigations on the suspected corruption that involved their own internal elements
Could the provincial satker take over the investigation process on cases that involved program managers at the kabupaten/kota level
The technical measures and stages to proceed when the complaints resolution process is conflicting with internal interests of related institutions are not clearly regulated
In practice, the handling of a complaint submitted to the satker was often undertaken solely by the head or a member of the satker without setting up or appointing an investigation or fact-finding team and was more informal in nature
As it was found in NTB, several complaints received directly by the satker head via SMS were handled individually
Although the reaction was quick and direct, the complaint and the resolution process were not well documented
There was also a concern that this kind of partial and ad-hoc handling would be unfair and unclear, both for the complainant and for the subject of the complaint because the investigation process was not undertaken in a transparent, comprehensive, and integrated way
(ii) Complaints through Schools According to the operational guidelines, schools also had to provide a complaints handling service and recorded all complaints that came in on the BOS-10 form
This study, however, did not find any notes and documentation of complaints that had ever been received by the sample schools
Nevertheless, in interviews with parents, teachers, and school committees, it was not uncommon to hear complaints, protests, and criticisms on the management of funds by the principal
Unfortunately, their protests and complaints were not expressed to the school, not only because of concerns that it would have an impact on their son's or daughter's school reports, but also because there was no mechanism available for submitting complaints freely that could guarantee the anonymity of the complainant
In many schools, the research team found no complaints box
There was no clear stipulation on the technical mechanism for the submission of complaints via a complaints box and the appointment of particular institutions/persons such as school committees and community leaders who are considered neutral in handling complaints
This condition also had an influence on the community's lack of courage in submitting complaints and criticisms to schools
(iii) Complaints through External Monitoring and Evaluation In almost all sample regions involved in this study, there were a large number of institutions outside the satker and schools that took part in receiving and channeling complaints, and even in handling the resolution of the complaints
Several institutions that were actively involved in this complaints handling effort included the DPRD, NGOs, and the local media
The DPRD of Kabupaten Malang, for example, opened a posko (post) to handle all complaints related to the implementation of the PKPS BBM that covered six programs, namely the SLT, BOS, BKM, Askes Gakin, Raskin and BKG
Through the press, the existence of this unit was announced to the public, complete with a telephone number that could be accessed
In Banten, the post office, as the channeling institution of the BOS funds, provided complaints boxes numbered 6000 to 6006 for general public
In Kabupaten Tapanuli Utara, a local NGO voluntarily followed complaints up by conducting investigations on the suspected inflation of student numbers and arrangement of textbook purchases
The findings of these investigations were reported to the DPRD, local legal authorities, and even to the provincial satker and the Anti-Corruption Commission (KPK).
In Kota Pematang Siantar, a private radio station broadcasted a live program on community complaints that also put many complaints on the implementation of the BOS on air
In this way, the relevant institutions, including the satker and DPRD, could undertake field checks and resolve the problem if the complaint was proven true
In Kabupaten Lombok Tengah and Kota Mataram, there was an NGO that actively received complaints and submitted them directly to the members of local DPRD
Institutions that participated in external monev were mostly active and reactive on the complaints received
Nevertheless, most of these institutions worked voluntarily and did not have clear authority to handle the complaints they received
The institutions that had quite strong authority were the supervisory bodies such as the Bawasda, Irjen and DPRD
For that reason, many other community based institutions such as the NGOs, mass organizations and education councils directed complaints that had been received to those institutions
If it was felt that the substance of the complaint was related to program managers or person's who were politically above criticism, these complaints were published in local or national newspapers as a means to pressure the authorities so that they would handle and process the complaint more transparently
Nevertheless, this system is not yet well coordinated and does not provide sufficient guarantee for adequate handling of the complaint
The unclear role of community elements has resulted in the follow-up of complaints becoming unfocused such as the cases and complaints that occurred in NTB
The NGOs and the local media in Lombok Tengah received a number of complaints regarding suspected deviation in the use of BOS funds in several schools, but they did not know where to lodge these complaints
They were worried that if it was submitted to the program manager in the education office and the Ministry of Religious Affairs office, there would be a negative reaction and it would endanger the complainant
In a hearing with members of the DPRD of Kota Mataram, an NGO submitted a complaint regarding the increase in tuitions in several schools that received the BOS funds and asked the DPRD to pressure relevant agencies to cancel this tuition increase
Until now, however, there has not been any follow-up of this complaint
There was a strong suspicion that the minimal response of relevant agencies was due to the lack of a clear role of external supervision
Relevant agencies did not have obligation to follow up complaints that are submitted by NGOs and the local media
Because of that, in several focus group discussions in Kota Mataram and Kabupaten Lombok Tengah, there was a strong endorsement for NGOs and local media, to be formally included in the supervision unit of BOS Program
In general, various cases and the means of complaints handling that were found in the field described above indicated the weakness or unavailability of an effective and integrated complaints handling system at all levels, including the Central Satker level, provincial and kabupaten/kota level and the school level
In addition to the inadequate performance of the internal complaints handling and channeling unit and the lack of clarity on the role of external monev in complaints handling, the lack of socialization of the existence of the complaints unit also affected the complaints handling and channeling system
The position of the complaints unit that is integrated with the satker at the provincial and kabupaten/kota levels does not appear to have been socialized, either to the community or to schools
This was also the case with the complaints unit's email, post box, and telephone number that were not well socialized and, in practice they are difficult for the community to access
Based on the number of complaints that were received by the Central Satker, most complainants who submitted criticisms, questions, and complaints to the toll-free number 0-800-140-1299 came from Java while users outside Java still appear to have difficulty accessing this facility (suspected due to technical obstacles)
In Banten, for example, the community and schools did not know of the existence of the complaint post box that was provided by the local post office
The difficulty of accessing the complaints unit at the provincial-level satker had encouraged schools to utilize the UPTD as the place for expressing complaints and seeking solutions on the BOS as it was often found in Banten, North Sumatra, and NTB
However, the UPTD was not formally included in the program management
Apart from the difficulty of accessing the formal complaints unit, there was a low level of community trust to the internal unit
This was indicated by the number of community members and teachers who submitted complaints about problems in the management of the BOS funds to the NGOs
The general public rarely made complaints because they did not know about the full design of the BOS Program, felt quite satisfied with the reduction/elimination of school tuition or the reduced obligation to purchase books, and did not know of the existence of the complaints unit
Parents were also concern that their complaints would impact their child's education performance
2.7 INSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS As explained in the general overview of BOS Program in Chapter I, in general, BOS Program management consisted of a combination of elements from the Ministry of National Education or education offices and those from the Ministry of Religious Affairs under a joint-management arrangement
The cooperation of these two agencies was needed because the management of public schools and religious schools (madrasah) are separated, each of which are under the control of the Depdiknas and the Depag16 repectively. For that reason, the choice of forming a joint-management for BOS Program was in principal quite appropriate from the perspective of government bureaucracy
In its implementation, however, the effort to join autonomous institutions (education affairs/public schools) and vertical institutions (religious matters/madrasah) appeared to have faced various obstacles
The PKPS-BBM Education sector satker as the form of joint-management between two different agencies should work as a team unit
In reality, however, they tended to work separately
At all levels of government administration, the SMERU research team found that staff from each agency in most satker not only work separately in the respective offices, but also did not develop the good communication and coordination activities, so several forms of jealousy and friction had arisen in the management of the program (Box 2.5)
2.7.1 Structure and Personnel of the Working Units (Satker) In general, the structure of the organization and the number of BOS Program management personnel were arranged without considering the number of public schools and madrasah/salafiyah in each region
In kabupaten/kota that had very few madrasah/salafiyah (Table 2.6), the number of personnel in the structure of the satker was made balance between the staffs from the education office and the staffs from the office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, so the personnel structure was the same as what is set by the operational guidelines of the program
In several regions, there were also a number of personnel who were found to be incompetent
They were usually officials who had been recently appointed as a leader of a work unit, when, in fact, they did not entirely understand the problems faced by their working unit
This problem is actually rooted in the national operational guidelines where the institutional arrangement are set without taking into account the composition of schools, the work unit, and the personnel who handle the education matters
The education office as the leader of the satker tended to dominate the management activities of BOS Program
This domination was felt down to the schools and madrasah, because in its implementation, the satker often utilized the UPTD
The UPTD, especially in kabupaten, had a role in almost all phases of the program
In most cases, they were the right-hand of the satker in performing direct contact with schools and madrasah, although institutionally they were not included in the structure of the satker of BOS Program
In the process, several madrasah managers said that they felt they were receiving more attention from public education offices rather than the religious offices, which are their “supervisors”
Unfortunately, the UPTD was not supported with comprehensive information and knowledge on the program, so many schools had to discuss their problems with the satker at the kabupaten education office
So far, the SMERU Team sees that the UPTD plays an important role as an intermediary/liaison between the satker and the schools/madrasah and that it is also the partner/facilitator of the schools/madrasah in managing BOS Program
Providing authority to UPTD to make decisions in connection with the program, however, needs to be avoided because the greater the simplicity of the bureaucratic system of a program, the more successful the program tends to be
Nevertheless, the UPTD needs to be provided with sufficient knowledge and funds so they can perform the task as a liaison and a facilitator seriously and effectively
2.7.2 The Role of School Committees and Education Councils In managing public funds, both from government sources and from the community, there were many schools that have not yet made an effort to develop professional behavior, honesty, transparency, and accountability
This rapid appraisal found a number of RAPBS that were prepared solely by the school principal or with the involvement of particular teachers, without consulting parents
There were also schools that had an organization of parent representatives, such as a school committee, however, its head was appointed unilaterally by the school management
As a result, the school committee only played the role as a “rubber stamp” for the interests of the school manager
The SMERU Team found two types of school committee heads whose characteristics were extremely different, but their influence on the school committee's activities was the same
On the one hand, there were schools whose committee head certainly did not understand the organization and the details of the schooling activities so he/she was incapable of performing a critical attitude to various issues at school
On the other hand, there were schools whose committee head was an official/scholar/community figure who has many commitments in many other places, which means that he/she did not have the time to scrutinize various events at school
In fact, several private schools that were visited during this study did not form a school committee yet
The assessment on the roles of education councils at the kabupaten/kota level in their relationship with education authorities, showed a condition that was much or less similar to the position of school committees to school management
In connection with BOS Program, the role of the education councils tends to be a “rubber stamp” for the interests of education authorities
In the preparation of the list of schools and the numbers of students that were submitted for BOS Program, the education councils only signed the drafts that had already been prepared by the education offices, without any opportunity to check their accuracy
The education councils also tended to be “elitist” in nature; they more often gave attention to education issues at the kabupaten/kota level
They tried to develop contacts with officials of the education offices, members of the DPRD and regents/mayors, but do not devote much time to issues that occur in schools and school committees
Exceptions were the education councils in Kabupaten Tapanuli Utara and Kabupaten Minahasa Utara
In Kabupaten Tapanuli Utara, the education council was pro-active in taking in complaints, conducting field checks and mediating the resolution of problems related with BOS Program
The education council also had already started monitoring of BOS Program by distributing questionnaires and visited several sample schools
All of these activities were paid by the operational funds of the education council that were obtained from the Depdiknas
In Kabupaten Minahasa Utara, with a subsidy of Rp 25,000,000 from the central government for the 2005 budget year, the education council organized several activities for all school committees in this kabupaten to socializing the functions and tasks of school committees
A reason for conducting this activity was because the formation of school committees is different from the BP3 in the past
The BP3 board in the past only consisted of parents, while the school committee consists of parents and other community members
In relation with the introduction of BOS Program, the education council of Kabupaten Minahasa Utara also organized a socialization program, which was carried out together with other activities
In this activity, the education council stressed that BOS was part of the revenue sources of the RAPBS, but the revenue sources of the RAPBS were not only from BOS
In this regard, the education council wanted to emphasize that there was still a need for the participation of various parties in the implementation of education, and education financing could not be restricted merely on BOS
For that reason, the education council was very concerned about the local government policy that exempt the students from paying the school tuition after the introduction of BOS
In addition, the education council of Kabupaten Minahasa Utara actively participated in the formulation of the Education Strategic Plan of the Kabupaten (RPPK) and the Education Strategic Plan of the Province (RPPP)
The education council was also active in campaigning for school autonomy or school-based management
In addition, the education council attempted to optimize their function in providing consideration, input, and support for the realization of education and being a mediator between schools, the community, and the government
2.7.3 Institutional Bureaucracy in the Management of BOS BOS Program that is currently funded by the central government, is managed through the deconcentration mechanism
In this system, the central government delegates the program management to provincial governments
For that reason, the accountability, which is in the form of a final report, is only made by the provincial and Central Satker
In the management of a program like this, the kabupaten/kota satker is responsible, in principle, only to the provincial satker and, then, to the Central Satker or the Depdiknas and Depag
Program proposals are also submitted to the provincial and Central Satker, so there is a possibility that regional governments and the DPRD do not know of the existence and progress of the program
Since education is one of the responsibilities of the regions, the provincial and the kabupaten/kota governments also made budget allocations and programs in the education sector, and several of them also provided operational assistance to schools
The Bappeda in several kabupaten/kota complained about the lack of coordination and information on the size of the funds and the benefits of BOS Program in the first semester of its implemenation, which made it difficult for local governments to arrange or adapt their education program funded by local governments to make it more effective
This is a common issue in the implementation of deconcentration programs
For that reason, several Bappeda of the kabupaten/kota suggested that the Bappeda should join in signing the proposals that were submitted by the education office (satker), or that the BOS funds be merged into a DAU with a specific condition of its usage, or be funded through DAK mechanism
to improve coordination and accountability at the regional level
2.8 THE IMPACT OF AND THE LEVEL OF SATISFACTION ON PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION Through BOS Program, the central government has provided a large-scale assistance of education funds, which is expected to produce a significant impact on the increase in the performance of education institutions
There are, however, several concerns that the expected impact cannot be achieved at an optimal level due to a variety of factors
Although BOS Program has been running for only a semester, this study attempted to assess the potential and the indications of the impact of the program, whether they are positive or negative
The discussion below will talk about these issues, based on the facts found in the course of this rapid appraisal
In addition, the last parts of the following section will, in particular, discuss the perceptions of stakeholders in the education sector regarding the various phases of program implementation
These perceptions were revealed in various focus group discussions, which were conducted in all samples of kabupaten/kota
2.8.1 Potentials and Indications of the Program's Impact In principal, BOS Program was aimed at increasing community access, especially for the poor, to quality education
This target was expected to be reached through the reduction of education costs paid by parents as the government funds most school operational costs and the cost of increasing the quality of teaching and learning activities
Given the large amount of funds provided for schools, BOS Program has strong potentials to produce significant impact
This impact, however, will be very much determined by the program management regarding school revenues, the quality of teaching and learning activities in schools, and the education costs beared by parents
Because BOS Program has just been implemented for a semester and the process of socialization was only implemented after the commencement of 2005-2006 academic year, it was expected that the impact of the program would not be optimal and clearly visible yet
Nevertheless, of the various data that was collected in this study, there were indications of the program impact
The discussion below attempts to highlight the impact of the program on school revenues and the increases in the quality of education; participation in education, especially for the poor; the participation of the community in funding education; and the budget allocations and programs development of the regional governments
Impact on School Revenues and the Quality of Education In almost all schools, the BOS funds have increased school revenues
For schools with a large number of students, the value of the increased in revenue is quite significant
In schools that previously set low school tuition, the BOS funds have resulted in school revenues rising severalfold compared with previous revenues
As an example, in several sample primary schools that previously set school tuition between Rp1,000 and Rp5,000 per month, with the BOS funds of Rp19,583 per student per month, the schools' revenues rose approximately fourfold to twentyfold
The revenue increases could be even greater because not all students have paid school tuition in the past
Of the sample schools, only one junior high school (in Kota Cilegon) experienced decreasing revenues after the introduction of BOS
This occurred because of an appeal from the Mayor that schools no longer allowed to charge school tuitions from parents; whereas the student tuitions in these schools before BOS were actually greater than the allocation of the BOS funds per student
The level of change in school revenues after the introduction of the BOS varied between schools
Of the 32 sample schools that provided data on revenues before and after the introduction of BOS, revenues in 13 schools (41%) rose by more than 100%, revenues in six schools (19%) rose between 50%-100%, revenues in 10 schools (31%) rose between 10%-40% and in two schools (7%) by less than 5%
At the same time, revenues of one school in Cilegon fell by approximately 15%
The number of sample schools based on the changes in revenue group before and after receiving BOS is presented in Table 2.7
From this table, it can be seen that there were more SD/MI schools that experienced revenue increases than SMP/MTs
There were 18 SD/MI schools, or approximately 90%, which revenue had increases, while, for the SMP/MT schools, there were only eight schools, or approximately 66.7%, which had increases in revenue
There were also more SD/MI schools that experienced jumps of revenue group by two levels compared with the SMP/MT schools
The schools that experienced increased in revenues were mostly public schools, especially rural SD/MI schools, which usually levied very small school tuitions and obtained very minimal amounts of operational funding from local governments, or private schools that had a lot of students who came from families that are less well-off
With the increase in school revenues after obtaining BOS, the school expenditures for operational costs have generally increased
The increase in expenditures happened because of the increase in the value of previously existed expenditure items, such as the MGMP/KKG activities, the procurement of teaching materials, honorariums for overtime, teachers' honorariums, and extra-curricular activities
In addition, there were new expenditure items, such as the honorariums for preparing test problems, the marking of tests, exam supervision and the procurement of textbooks
This expenditure increase was also triggred by the schools' understanding that BOS funds that had been received in the first semester had to be used in the first semester
From the enhancements in the schools financial capacity and the increase in expenditure, there were indications that the quality of education will improve, with several conditionalities
Some indications of the improved quality of education could be seen from
1
The increased intensity of activities such as the MGMP and the KKG which were associated with increasing teachers quality
It needs to be noted, however, that the impact of these activities would be maximized if the quality of these activities can be maintained
This study has not yet examined the quality of these activities thoroughly, but there were several cases that indirectly provided indications of weakness in the control of the quality of these activities (see Sub-section 2.4.2)
2
The increased teacher incomes, both via increases in the honorariums of nonpermanent teachers and from additional revenues for permanent and nonpermanent teachers, due to the increases in the teaching and learning activities
With this increased in income, there were indications that the motivation of teachers to teach increased
There were also complaints in several schools, however, that the motivation of permanent teachers was somewhat decreased because they did not receive any of the BOS funds, which they knew had a large value
In fact, these teachers could previously received allocations from school tuitions, which were far smaller in value
3
The increased in the availability of teaching equipment and materials, both consumables, such as chalk, and non-consumables, such as maps, balls, skills development tools, rulers, etc
In several poor schools, this increase was very significant because the operational funds before the introduction of BOS were very minimal
In fact, the stock of chalk was very limited so teachers rarely wrote on the blackboard and students also were rarely directed to do their tasks on the blackboard
For that reason, teaching and learning activities became very boring
With the increase in teaching materials and equipment, teachers became more motivated and are free to apply various teaching techniques
The increase in the quality of these teaching and learning activities, however, certainly needs to be accompanied with an increase in the capability of teachers
4
The increased collection of books in schools, both handbooks for teachers and core textbooks and supplementary textbooks
Almost all schools made a rather large allocation for the purchase of books
The collection of library books was minimal because the purchase of books was quite a burden for parents and rebates were provided as incentives for purchases
The factor that needs to be given attention to in this matter is the quality of the books being purchased and the possibility of enforced purchases such as the case described in Box 2.2 in Sub-section 2.4.2; 
5
The increased intensity and number of types of extra-curricular activities
Several schools improved the quality of extra-curricular activities by hiring special teachers or special trainers and by adding to the types of extra-curricular activities because the school could provide additional incentives for teachers who supervised these activities
In this regard, the quality of the activities certainly needs to receive attention so that their benefits can be really felt by the students and they are not created just to use up the funds
Although there were many indications that BOS Program would enhance the quality of education, there were concerns that the program administration at the school level would take up too much time and attention of school principal and the teacher who is appointed as BOS treasurer
The shortage of time and attention experienced by the shool principal, in particular, could have a bad impact on the quality of teaching and learning activities in general
At least in the initial phase of the program implementation, which was during the first semester of 2005/2006, almost all schools complained about the administration and reporting that was considered to be quite onerous and timeconsuming
There was a possibility that this occurred because schools did not yet fully understand the program management and reporting system, so it was expected that in the following semesters it would not take up a lot of time and attention
However, because the role of the school principal is crucial in the management of teaching and learning activities, there is a need to provide administrative staff in all schools so that the program administration will not be too time-consuming and demanding on the attention of school principal and teachers
Impact on Enrollment and School Dropouts At the time this study was undertaken, the impact of the program on children participation in education, which is usually measured by the net enrollment rate (APM), gross enrollment rate (APK), school dropout rate, and the transition rate, could not yet be observed because BOS Program had only been operating for a semester
However, several education offices stated that there were indications of a positive impact
The Education Office of East Java, for example, declared an indication of a decrease in the dropout rate, especially for rural, isolated, and outlying areas
Based on the information from the Education Office of Kabupaten Malang, the dropout rate in primary schools fell from 0.43% in the 2004/2005 academic year to 0.39% in semester I of the 2005/2006 academic year; and in junior high schools the dropout rate fell from 1.57% in the 2004/2005 academic year to 1.52% in semester I of the 2005/2006 academic year
It needs to be noted in this case that the province of East Java implemented the PSBMP Program starting in the 2004/2005 academic year and in Kabupaten Malang poor students have been freed from school tuition since the 2004/2005 academic year
In Kabupaten Lebak, the education office also reported that the APK in primary schools rose from 98% (2004/2005) to 108% (semester I, 2004/2005)
It is suspected that the increase in the APK occurred because of the increased participation in several outlying regions
In junior high schools, the APK also rose from 52% (2004/2005) to 65.4% (November 2005) and the school transition rate from primary to junior high schools rose from 70% to 81.3%
The rise in the APK for junior high schools and the school transition rate, however, could have occurred because of the construction of several new public and private junior high school buildings
In other sample regions, at the time of the study, the latest education participation rate data were not yet available
Although quantitative data cannot yet present an estimate of the impact of BOS on education participation, the results of the qualitative analysis from FGDs and interviews gave an indication of a positive impact, with the exception of decreasing the dropout rate in junior high schools
From the results of interviews in schools, there were indications that BOS Program improved the motivation of students to study, especially those from poor families, and encouraged students to stay in school
This was observed from their tendency to be more diligent in going to school because there was no concern of being asked to pay for school tuition and their need for schools supplies were met
All education sector stakeholders who participated in the FGDs also assessed BOS Program as being very beneficial for the poor (Figure 2.5)
When asked to give an assessment within a range between 0 (of no benefit) and 10 (very beneficial), most gave the score of more than 7
In general, discussion participants were of the opinion that the program was very beneficial for the poor because of the low cost of education
They believed that the poor obtained quite a significant benefit, although only a few schools provided special assistance for poor students (see Sub-section 2.1.1)
Without obtaining special assistance, with only the decrease in school costs or, in fact, the exemption from school tuition in most schools in rural areas, the poor would have the courage to send their children to school
Nevertheless, stakeholders in the city, in general, assessed the program as relatively poor
In their opinion, in the urban situation where quite a lot of parents are economically well-off, providing equal subsidies from BOS Program (based on school policy) is considered to reduce the value of the benefit for poor students
Because quite a lot of urban schools before BOS Program had school tuition that was greater than the value received from the program, these schools are still charging school tuition, and very rarely do schools specifically exempt poor students from school tuition
Therefore, the level of program benefits for the poor under the current method of implementation is considered not too high
For that reason, there was a suggestion to put more emphasis on the need to give priority on the assistance of poor students or, in fact, to allocate part of the BOS funds to providing scholarships for poor students
In connection with the efficacy of BOS Program in preventing student dropouts, particularly in junior high schools, the results of this study found an indication of the weak impact of the program in preventing dropouts in junior high schools
The results of interviews with parents that have children who dropped out of school, several of which had just recently dropped out in the academic year of 2005/2006, showed that most of them were unaware of the existance of BOS Program in their children school
The results of the interviews with schools and discussion in FGDs revealed the fact that schools were not aware that BOS Program was aimed at preventing students from dropping out
This was not highly emphasized in the socialization and in the agreement on the receipt of assistance (contract on program implementation)
For that reason, schools tended not to make a special effort to prevent dropouts
In addition, the problem of dropouts, particularly in junior high schools, was not only caused by economic incapacity, but also due to other factors, such as student delinquency and the attraction of working
Impact on Community Participation in Education As the capability of schools in fulfilling their operational costs increased, several cost components that are usually funded by school tuition (committee fund, BP3 or SPP), or other levies, were no longer charged on parents
This certainly impacted on the decline in education costs paid by parents
The decline in the cost of education included, among others, the reduction or elimination of school tuition, and the availability of some core and supplementary books at school, so parents did not need to buy several types of books
The amount of cost reduction enjoyed by parents varied between schools and between parents in the same school
This variation was resulted from the different decisions made across schools on the use of BOS funds and because there were schools that provided special assistance for students who were deemed poor or who were in need
Even if the amount of cost reduction was the same, the value of the benefit that was felt by parents from lower, middle, and higher income groups would be different because the value of benefits for poor parents tended to be higher
On the one hand, the decline in or exemption from school tuition can be deemed a positive impact that is consistent with the objectives of the program, as it was outlined in the 2005 program operational guidelines
On the other hand, several parties raised concerns that the exemption from school tuition and the provision of assistance in large amounts will increase the dependency of the community and reduce the community's self-reliance
Opinions on the impact of free or reduced student tuition on the participation of parents in encouraging their children to study also varied
Some claimed that parents' support for their child was increasing, but there were some who also stated that there were indications that parents did not pay too much attention to or were not too supportive of their child's study because they did not have to pay the school tuition anymore
Because of the great emphasis on free schooling and the tendency of schools to treat all students equally, irrespective of their parents' economic capability, the participation of parents in the education funding tended to decrease
This decrease did not really reflect the decreasing will of the well-off or wealthy parents to participate
From the results of the interviews with the relatively well-off parents, quite a lot were actually willing to continue paying school tuition but schools had already taken unilateral decision to exempt or reduce the tuition
The large volume of funds provided through BOS Program also raises concerns that it will reduce participation of the broad community, both individually and corporately, in the education funding
In one sample MTs school that usually received contributions from a large company in its area, it appeared that in the 2005/2006 academic year this school no longer received any contribution
Although there was no official explanation from the company, this was possibly influenced by the introduction of BOS
For that reason, several parties considered the introduction of BOS Program to be inconsistent with the effort to encourage school-based management because under the latter system, the role of the community is very much emphasized
Impact on the Regional Education Program and Budget In many regions, the total BOS funds received by schools in a kabupaten/kota were far greater than the education budget allocated by the kabupaten/kota regional government
For that reason, there were concerns that the kabupaten/kota government would likely to divert their budget allocations from education to other sectors
At the time of this study, the RAPBD (local government budget plan) in the sample kabupaten/kota had not yet been passed, but from interim information and data, there were indications that of the ten sample kabupaten/kota, eight kabupaten/kota did not plan to reduce their budget allocation for education
In fact, two city administrations intended to increase their education budget
This increase would be allocated to support BOS Program in providing matching funds or undertaking supporting activities such as training on school-based management for school principals
In two other sample cities, however, there were indications that the local budget allocations for education would be reduced
In Kota Cilegon, although the local government had provided allowances for the transportation and welfare improvement of teachers, the planned allocation for the education budget tended to decline from approximately Rp75.4 billion (2005) to Rp74 billion (2006)
The sample schools in this city also stated that after the introduction of BOS, they had not yet received the BOP funds but there were no explanation whether those funds had been eliminated or were just delayed
In Kota Mataram, there had also been a decline in the allocation of funds for education in the APBD, because in the previous year, specifically at the time of the pilkada, education funding rose sharply and was used, among others, to build three high quality primary schools
For that reason, the budget allocation for education in the APBD of this city fell from 44% in 2004 to 36% in 2005, and continued to fall to 32% in 2006
These changes in the budget allocations for education were influenced by various factors and it had not yet been proven whether the introduction of BOS caused local governments to reduce budget allocations for education
Nevertheless, it appeared that BOS Program has influenced the local governments' program planning in the education sector
Several examples of kabupaten/kota administration programs that were adapted to BOS Program include, inter alia
In Kota Pasuruan, the city administration provided suplemantary funds for BOS of Rp10,000/student/month for primary schools and Rp20,000/student/month for junior high schools
The use of these funds was relatively more flexible than the BOS funds so they could be used to cover expenditure items that were not included in BOS Program
In addition, the city administration of Kota Pasuruan also allocated Rp13.4 billion to rehabilitate school buildings
50% came from the central government, 30% from the provincial government, and 20% from the local administration.
In Kota Cilegon, the local administration provided grants for teachers in the forms of transportation and welfare allowances
In Kota Manado, the local administration provided an additional subsidy to schools so the total funds (BOS and the local subsidy) received by schools was Rp22,500/student/month for primary schools and Rp47,500/student/month for junior high schools
In addition, the local government also provided assistance of Rp50,000/teacher/month for all teachers
In Kabupaten Minahasa Utara, the local government also provided additional supplemantary funds for the BOS for each student in the public junior high schools, and additional operational funds of Rp400,000 for each school principal
In Kota Pematang Siantar, the local administration provided an allowance of Rp25,000 per person for both state and non-government teachers, and a welfare allowance for all city officials, the amount of which depended on their level
In Kabupaten Tapanuli Utara, the local government planned to provide a teacher's welfare allowance of Rp50,000 per person per month
2.8.2 The Level of Satisfaction on the Program Implementation 
The BOS Program was undertaken hastily, without sufficient preparation
The intensity and scale of the problems differed between regions because the technical aspects of the program's implementation were also influenced by local policies and different interpretations of the operational guidelines
In general, the results of the school and institutional FGDs, which are presented in Figure 2.6, show that FGD participants were not that satisfied with the implementation of several phases of the program
The average score from all FGDs (total FGDs was 20) for the seven implementation-phases ranged between 5.4 and 6.6
Of the various phases of the BOS implementation, in general, the FGD result showed that socialization was deemed as the least satisfactory
Various parties participated in the discussions considered the socialization to be a very important phase, as it determined the success and smooth running of the subsequent phases
Because the socialization of this program was conducted in stages, this result indirectly indicated a shortfall in the mechanism for the delivery of material/communication from the central government level to the provincial level, from the provincial level to the kabupaten/kota level and from the kabupaten/kota to the program implementers in schools
In addition, the socialization problem that was mostly often raised was regarding the inconsistency between the message delivered through the mass media and the internal socialization material of the program, particularly on the exemption from school tuition
The very limited funds, time, and media for the socialization that had been conducted were also considered to be the root of the problems in several other implementation phases, including in the utilization of funds, reporting, monitoring and evaluation, and the handling of complaints
Following socialization, the other most unsatisfactory phases were complaints handling, the distribution of funds, reporting, and monitoring and evaluation
Many parties considered that the handling of complaints lacked transparency, and non-government parties, particularly, had difficulty in directing complaints that they had received
Furthermore, many were not sure that several complaints had been adequately followed up
The problem with the distribution of funds that was mostly highlighted was the delay in the receipt of funds in school's account
This delay caused funds utilization to be less effective, and even caused schools to provide reports that were not in accordance with their realization as discussed in the sub-section on the utilization of funds and reporting from schools
Meanwhile, in the reporting, and monitoring and evaluation, the problem that was most often voiced was the difficulty of schools in preparing financial reports and the large number of institutions which undertook the monitoring and evaluation activities, as well as the abuse of monitoring and evaluation activities by unscrupulous and irresponsible people (see the sub-section on monitoring and evaluation)
Schools, which were represented by principals and school committees, tended to give higher scores compared to stakeholders at the kabupaten/kota level
This indicated that most schools felt relatively more satisified with the implementation of the program than the stakeholders at the kabupaten/kota level
In general, all stakeholders at the kabupaten/kota level, which consisted of the satker, relevant government institutions, the DPRD, community elements from the education council, observers, NGOs and foundations in the education sector, and the local media, were more criticial in highlighting problems in various phases of the implementation
Meanwhile, schools were more concerned with the problems of the delay in the receipt of funds that disturbed school operational activities, the socialization of the program that led to misunderstanding between parents and schools on the matter of school tuition and levies, as well as the channeling of complaints
If the FGDs in the kabupaten and the FGDs in the city were differentiated, it appeared that, in general, the kabupaten FGDs gave higher scores, or were more satisfied with the implementation of the program compared to the FGDs in the city
The most striking differences between the two were the problems of socialization, the distribution of funds, and reporting
Inconsistencies in the explanation about BOS Program, in particular, had caused more problems in the city because the community received a lot of information from various media, including newspapers, radio, and television
The statements that were made by the regional government officials were also often incorrect
Therefore, they caused some misunderstanding between schools and school committees or parents
This situation was worsened by the fact that in the cities there were still many schools that were not exempting from school tuition, because the past school tuition was greater than the BOS funds
Meanwhile, in the kabupaten, there were only a few community members who access information from the mass media and most schools have abolished school tuition
The level of parents' satisfaction was only explored through in-depth interviews with the parents of students and the parents of school dropouts who lived in the vicinity of the sample schools
These interviews uncovered that most parents, especially those who are poor or almost poor, were quite satisfied with BOS Program because the school tuition for their children became cheaper or even free after the introduction of BOS
They have been significantly benefited by the removal of admission fee and by the decrease in the number of books to be purchased
This statement was consistent with the assessment of the level of benefits for poor students revealed in the FGDs as mentioned previously
The level of benefits from the introduction of BOS Program for parents who were less than or not well-off tends to be higher than that for those who were well-off
Moreover, Some well-off parents stated that the benefits of BOS were not significantly felt and they thought that this program would be better if the funds were directed towards students who were really poor or not well-off
This can be understood because the value of assistance received was probably far smaller than the total cost of education that still had to be borne or paid
Almost all parents whose children previously received a BKM scholarship appeared to prefer BOS Program
The reasons for this were
they did not receive the BKM in cash and were often still charged for payments that could not be covered by the BKM funds; 
the BKM was only received for a semester because it was given in turns; 
and if a parent had more than one child in school, then usually only one of them could receive BKM for reasons of equity
In addition, several parents also questioned the criteria for selecting the students who were eligible as BKM recipients because the schools' selection criteria and mechanism were considered to be unclear and not transparent
III
RECOMMENDATIONS 3.1 
CONCLUSIONS AND GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS 
In general, the results of this rapid appraisal show that BOS Program is very helpful in assisting teaching and learning activities in schools and, within certain limits, has reduced the burden of education costs that are borne by parents
Although the impact of the program cannot yet be evaluated thoroughly, the results of this study uncovered the potential benefits of the program in enhancing community access, particularly of the poor, to better quality education
Nevertheless, this study also found several problems that could potentially reduce the effectiveness of the program or caused the benefits of the program to be less optimal in enhancing community access, particularly of the poor, to quality education
In order to optimize the benefits of the program, there is still a need for improvement in the concept and technical aspects of the program, as well as in the support for enhancing the quality of the implementation of all phases of the program
The results of the study show the strategic position of schools as the spearhead of the program
Therefore, enhancing the capacity of school institutions, in the area of administration as well as in the internal control mechanism (checks and balances) will also greatly determine the effectiveness of the program
By taking into account the benefits that have been realized and the potential benefits of the program in the future, it is suggested that BOS Program be continued with various conceptual and technical refinements
Suggestions for technical refinements in the various phases of the program implementation will be presented in the following subsection
In the following sections, there will be discussions and suggestions on program concepts, especially those related with
(i) the debate on the choice between “free schooling” and “subsidies for poor students” and (ii) the program implementation mechanism from the center to the regions
(i) “Free Schooling” or “Subsidies for Poor Students” Conceptually, BOS Program, which is currently implemented, attempted to increase the access of the poor to education by means of exempting them from the cost of education
To realize this intention, there was a stipulation that schools whose tuition was less than the BOS funds had to give exemptions, while those whose school tuition was higher than the BOS funds were still allowed to charge the tuition
In relation with the mandate of Law No 20 of 2003, Sections 5 and 11 
this requirement tended to be in opposition to this law because it “imposed” differences in the education financing between schools
This requirement will directly cause discrimination or differences in the quality of service between schools
This is worsened by the notion that schools exempting school tuition, or implemented “free schooling”, may not impose any levies at all and do not need assistance from other parties outside the government
In fact, the funds provided through BOS Program will not be sufficient in providing quality education services
This problem is very much a dilemma; on the one hand, equal dispensation from school costs will reduce psychological impediments for poor parents to send their children to school
On the other hand, the exemption from school tuition for poor students only, whose poor student status is determined by schools, does not provide sufficient assurance for parents from poor backgrounds that their child will be exempted from school costs
Past experience showed that schools often discriminate against poor students, or require various identity documents that cost money to obtain
For that reason, there is a need for a clear formulation on what role BOS Program really plays in funding schools, so ambivalence does not arise in its implementation
This decision shoud be grounded on political choices regarding the program's objectives, namely whether it is intended
(a) for fulfilling the right of all citizens in obtaining education, so all people are considered to have the same right to receive subsidies, or (b) for guaranteeing the poor's access to education services so subsidies have to be provided only to poor students
BOS Program in its implementation tends to be in the middle of these two choices, and more often puts the decision in the hands of the school, giving rise to confusion
To overcome this problem, courage to affirm one's position is needed
If this program is politically intended for objective (a), the alternative suggestion is to position BOS Program as government assistance for the implementation of a minimum basic service in education
With this choice, all schools can be obligated to dispense with fees that are used to fund the type of education service that is determined as the minimum service
For funding the services outside this minimum service standard, schools can obtain funding from outside BOS Program, including from parents, community's donations, or other government assistance that is voluntary in nature
However, if the program is intended to meet objective (b), basic changes should be made in the program design, particularly by adopting a clearer targeting mechanism
There are several alternative methods, among which is through the targeting of regions and individuals
In the regional targeting, it can be determined that the schools that receive the program are located in poor regions and these schools have to implement free education
This method will be effective for regions where the poor lived in groups, but ineffective if their locations are spread out
The indvidual targeting can be undertaken by identifying poor or less well-off families, whose children are suitable recipients of a free education
The selection should not be done solely by schools, but also by independent officials
Another alternative is through the provision of conditional subsidies, where poor families are given a card to obtain a free education and schools will charge the government for the provision of the service to the poor students
Although the suggestions presented above are divided into two, there is still a possibility of both being implemented together in the form of two different programs
Whatever choice is made, however, the position of BOS Program in this education funding has to be delivered clearly and widely, both to the program managers and to the general public
(ii) Program Implementation Mechanism Given the limitations in the quality of data collection as well as the capability of program managers at all levels, the deconcentration mechanism is quite appropriate at the present time
As time passes, the entire experience of implementing and fulfilling the demands of BOS Program will become a valuable lesson for the stakeholders
Based on that experience, in the long run, program managers at the regional level will become increasingly skillful and capable of handling various organizational impediments and the administration of the program
Eventually, when the quality of the school and student data has been developed well, there needs a measure to explore the possibility of the BOS funds to be managed through routine mechanisms by various stakeholders as their main task and function
The steps and towards this direction are supported by several practical as well as legal grounds
The practical reasons are
1
This assistance program is in practice managed by the working units of education offices, including schools and madrasah
In this regard, whether there is operational assistance or not, the routine duty of these offices is to guide and manage schooling activities, especially regarding the operationalization of schools and madrasah; 
2
Until now, despite the various limitations, the community and local education offices have met the responsibility of providing school operational funds
Therefore, BOS Program should be truly treated as “assistance”, not “substitution”, in the effort to strengthen the ability of the community and education offices to operate schools and madrasah
The legal foundations include
1
Law No 32 of 2004 on Local Government Administration which sets out a regulation that education, including the school operational funding, is the mandatory authority of the autonomous regions (provinces and kabupaten/kota); 
2
Section 108, paragraph (1) of Law No 33 of 2004 on Fiscal Balance between Central and Regional Governments which states
“Deconcentration Funds and Emergency Assistance Funds that are part of the budget of the state ministries/institutions which are used to conduct matters that, according to regulations are regional authorities, should be diverted in phases into Special Allocation Funds.” The desire to change the institutional aspects of BOS Program into the routine daily tasks and functions of education offices needs the diversion of deconcentration funds for the education sector/affairs into DAK funding
At the same time, this diversion will deliver political massage on the seriousness of the central government in implementing the decentralization and regional autonomy policy in the manner mandated by the government regulation
The change to the DAK certainly requires good preparation and arrangement because so far the DAK has only been used for infrastructure development although actually there are no laws and government regulations which state that the DAK can only be used for this purpose
Government Regulation number 55/2005 only states that the DAK can not be used for paying the administration cost of the program, the preparation of physical activities, research, training, and official trips (Section 60, article 3)
Consequently, the central and regional governments should provide funds for program support and safeguarding separately as complementary funding
In this regard, the madrasah issue becomes a dilemma
Given that madrasah is not included in the authority of autonomous regions (provinces and kabupaten/kota), the central government cannot legally demand local governments to allocate funds for madrasah affairs in the APBD although they are originated from the DAK funds
Section 39, paragraph (1) of Law No 33 of 2004 states
“The DAK funds are allocated to certain regions to fund special activities that are under regional duties” 
One way out of this dilemma is through the stakeholders having the courage to consider decentralizing madrasah so that madrasah become the responsibility of autonomous regions in the education sector, as it is the case for public schools
With this delegation of authority, it is expected that regions will give the same attention to madrasah, though the Ministry of Religious Affairs can still provide special assistance
3.2
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EACH IMPLEMENTATION PHASE 
Based on the field findings that were analyzed in Chapter 2, several recommendations have been formulated based on the phases of the implementation of the program
1
Data Collection and Allocations i) There needs to be a manual and schedule for better data collection so that the data collection process does not cause delays in the distribution of funds
One of the alternatives is by using student data as of 31 August of the previous academic year as the basis of determining allocations
This date is chosen because by that time student numbers are usually relatively stable and will not change much during the academic year
However, because the number of students always changes, the authority needs to be given to the provincial and kabupaten/kota offices to reallocate funds at the kabupaten/kota and school levels
The adjustment to the data on student numbers that is used to determine the funding amount that the school is entitled to is based on the number of students by 31 August of the relevant academic year
This data is the result of the verification conducted by the kabupaten/kota satker and should be announced by the local media as well as be placed on the school notice board
The data collection process also needs to be backed up with better capability of data and information management and its supporting tools, such as computerization down to the kecamatan level, especially for kabupaten that have large numbers of schools and a large geographical area
ii) In order to keep the allocation process as simple as possible, the allocations of funds should continue to be based on the number of students
However, schools which have few students, many teachers paid by honorarium and many poor students, and are located in isolated places need to obtain special allocations/programs from the APBN or APBD
Although there were many suggestions on the need for weighting based on isolation or price index, this is not recommended, because it often provides space for lobbying and causes inefficiency
iii) The provision of BOS for salafiyah tended to be problematic due to the weaknesses in the data collection and monitoring, the limitations in the administrative capacity of managers, the unbinding nature of salafiyah, and the fact that some of its students attend other formal schools
However, because many salafiyah support students from poor families, consideration should be given on providing assistance in the form of special programs outside the BOS
iv) To guarantee that schools and foundations do not take unilateral decisions to reject BOS, rejections by schools should be accompanied by a written declaration on the results of consultation between the school and the council of teachers, school committee, and parents' representatives
2
Socialization v) Program managers need to be better informed
Socialization for program implementers should be provided in the form of training
Training for all institutional levels needs to be improved by providing an adequate allocation of time, material, and methods that support the technical skills (for example, the preparation of the RAPBS and financial report)
Apart from this training, capacity building for program managers needs to be supported by a consultant team located at the kabupaten/kota level
This team should have the task of assisting schools, providing explanations on the management of the program and, at the same time, serving as a channel for complaints
vi) The socialization material for the community needs to be revised so the information is consistent from the central level down to the regions and in all media so conflict does not arise as a result of different interpretations
Socialization to the community also needs to be conducted through various channels, including
schools, electronic and printing media, and the distribution of brochures and posters
In addition, there needs to be informal socialization from the schools and other program implementers, such as through village meetings and religious activities
3
Channeling and Absorption of Funds vii) The appointment of channeling institutions should be undertaken transparently and give priority to the convenience of the services for schools
Channeling means and schemes that are agreed between the satker and channeling institutions have to give priority to flexibility in obtaining and adding funds if necessary, and minimize the cost and opportunity of misuse when funds are being withdrawn
viii) Schools should be given the freedom to open accounts at any financial institution
Financial institutions have to be informed of the requirement that accounts have to be in the name of the school and be signed by two people, that is, the school principal and treasurer
This requirement has to be implemented by the financial institution where the school account is kept
ix) Funds should be deposited in school accounts early in the semester so that schools can utilize them in accordance with the RAPBS
To support the smooth running of the distribution of funds, there needs to be a tight scheduling of the implementation phases (see recommendation (i))
Consideration of a special mechanism is also needed to anticipate the occurrence of unforeseen events resulting from natural disasters or political instability, for example, by delegating authority to the higher level satker (from kabupaten/kota to province and from province to central government) if, at a particular time, the satker in a region cannot function
x) The distribution of funds should not be burdened with additional requisites that prolong the bureaucracy, with the exception of what is already set out in the operational and technical guidelines
xi) There is no need for regulating a time limit for withdrawing funds, given that the needs of schools are not always the same each month
In additon, it needs to be affirmed that the distribution and use of funds are not limited to only one semester
4
Utilization of Funds xii) The stipulation on the 11 permitted uses of the BOS funds needs to be reviewed so it can be more flexible and capable in accommodating school programs that are set out in the RAPBS
There also needs to be flexibility so the use of funds can be based on a regional agreement and, therefore, adjusted to the existence and uses of other funding sources, including the one from the APBD
The agreement of each region has to be reported to and obtain the approval of the provincial satker
xiii) To ensure that all stakeholders at the school level (teachers, committee, parents) will be involved in the preparation of RAPBS, RAPBS has to have the minutes of the parents' meetings and list of attendees attached
The education office and its officials at the kecamatan level have to provide guidance so schools are able to prepare a good RAPBS
xiv) There needs to be more emphasis on providing priority in the use of funds for poor students and this needs to be socialized to the public
The allocations should not be established only for transportation costs but could also be provided to fulfill other needs related to the study process such as books, uniforms, and shoes
In addition, there is a need to introduce a general regulation on the process of determining poor students
xv) The government regulation that states that the interests on the BOS funds have to be returned to the state has to be socialized properly to all program managers, especially schools and channeling institutions, as well as banks where the schools open their accounts
xvi) The payment of tax should be socialized to all parties and managed by the associated tax authorities in the region so the procedure for their management and payment is simpler and does not cause difficulties for schools
5
Reporting xvii) To guarantee the transparency and accountability on the use of funds, schools should be required to submit the accountability report to school committee
In addition, they should also inform the community, at least, by attaching a summary of the report on the school notice board and distributing copies to parents and teachers
xviii) The reporting from schools should be conducted every semester so it will not become a burden for schools and disturb the teaching and learning activities of the schools
6
Monitoring, Evaluation, and Complaints Handling xviii) The external monitoring and evaluation can only be undertaken by the competent institutions and should be accompanied by a reference letter from the mandated agency
The results of this activity have to provide clear feedback to management institutions
xix) Big programs such as BOS need a professional and independent monitoring and evaluation (monev) team that has the authority to do audit and investigation
This independent monev unit also undertakes the function of complaints handling
This unit should be independent and separate from the program management team so conflicts of interest do not arise and can be better in guaranteeing the anonymity of the complainant
The unit should be located at the central and provincial levels and have the authority to receive complaints from various sources, undertake investigations, and handle their resolution, including their channeling to legal authorities or institutions with the authority in the regions (such as Bawasda) or the provinces (Irwilprop) in order that legal steps can be taken or sanctions can be issued if the unscrupulous party is proven guilty
This independent monitoring team actively organizes, collects, and analyzes all forms of complaints that are received through various channels, such as the print and electronic media, NGOs, and other institutions
Furthermore, this team undertakes fact-finding and investigation activities, and recommends solutions to the associated authorities
The monitoring team also functions to ascertain whether complaints that came in have been followed up or not and periodically monitor the handling process
In addition, this team should also function as a mediator and facilitator between the implementing parties (satker and schools), external monitoring parties and complainants in cases of enmity between them
xxi) The existence of the unit and the complaints medium needs to be broadly informed to the community and schools
The socialization of the unit and complaints medium at various levels should be involving local media and NGOs so that it can reach the community at large
In addition, the delivery of information on the follow-up effort or the resolution of each complaint has to be provided to the reporter
This is necessary to build community trust in service effectiveness of the available complaints unit
xxii) Information on the existence of the complaints unit and medium should be as complete as possible, including a number that can be accessed (telephone, fax, post office box), a clear address that can be easily reached, the team that is responsible, the grace period for the expected resolution, etc
In addition, the ideal and optimal complaints handling process requires a number of aspects
a complaint handling paradigm that guarantees the anonymity of the complainant, a handling process that relies on team work (not individual task), and determination of a timeline on handling
xxiii) Complaints can be submitted through various means, such as the print and electronic media, NGOs, consultation teams and legislative institutions, and they are then referred to the independent complaints unit that was mentioned at point (xx) above
xxiv) A complaints service should also be developed and undertaken by schools so that problems in schools can be overcome as quickly as possible
Therefore, it is recommended that schools provide a type of complaints box that is opened every certain period by the school committee together with the school management
Complaints also have to be documented and efforts should be made to follow them up
This is important to do so that the follow-up process and the serious resolution efforts can provide a positive effect on community participation (in the form of criticisms and suggestions) and develop the community's trust
7
Institutional Affairs xxv) The structure of the PKPS-BBM for the BOS team at the provincial and kabupaten/kota levels should not be rigidly determined, and the regions were given freedom to arrange themselves by considering the competencies of the members of satker and the composition of school types in the relevant district
xxvi) Program management should be delegated to the Ministry of National Education
Program management at the regional level should be transferred to the offices that handle education affairs
The Ministry of Religious Affairs should be involved in the entire management of the program as a member of the satker, particulary in connection with the data collection on madrasah
xxvii) Steps need to be taken to prepare for the shift in the program management mechanism from deconcentration to DAK funding
In the mean time, the coordination at the kabupaten/kota and provincial levels should be enhanced, at least, by providing information on the allocation plan in the beginning of the budget year so that programs can be better coordinated
Objective Measures of Family Welfare for Individual Targeting
Results from Pilot Project on Community Based Monitoring System in Indonesia ABSTRACT This report documents the results of a pilot project on a new poverty monitoring system that improves the current system in three areas
First, it involves the locals in monitoring poverty in their own area
Second, the poverty indicators are sensitive to local conditions, accurate, and cannot be easily tampered
Third, the results are expeditious, with only five months needed between the start of data collection to final publication
Given Indonesia's geographical size and the decentralization that puts more power at the hands of the district governments in determining poverty alleviation programs, we believe that this monitoring system is the most suitable for Indonesia
I
INTRODUCTION
In Indonesia, the government has relatively little problem in conducting regional targeting of the poor
Statistics Indonesia's relatively reliable Susenas and Podes surveys have been the basis for distributing and allocating programs designed specifically to alleviate poverty in Indonesia
Problems, however, start to arise when local officials at the district level have to actually identify who the poor are and where they are located, because Susenas and Podes do not provide them with this information
In order to gain some sense of where the poor are, the program implementers turned to BKKBN (National Family Planning Coordination Board) data, whose original purpose is to monitor the implementation of the national family planning program, and thus is not suited to undertake the task of identifying poor families
The use of this data has contributed to substantial undercoverage and leakage of government programs aimed at the poor 
For precisely the reason mentioned above, during the 1997 crisis the importance of a proper household targeting mechanism gained recognition
Furthermore, in the light of the decentralization of budgetary power to local governments in 2001 and the new Law on Regional Government that stipulates that governors, regents (district heads) and village heads are now chosen through direct election in their respective areas, government officials are now under enormous pressure to significantly improve their performance
There have been at least four major efforts carried out by local governments to improve monitoring of the poor and programs related to poverty in the decentralization era
three were conducted in 2001 by the Provinces of Jakarta, East Java and South Kalimantan in cooperation with Statistics Indonesia; and the other is still ongoing in the District of Sikka in East Nusa Tenggara
The cost of each of these ”census of the poor”is not insignificant
The 2001 poor census cost each province around US$600,000, while the bill for the ongoing census in Sikka is currently US$170,000; an enormous amount of money for a district in the poorest province in Indonesia
The three 2001 censuses have been discontinued, although East Java is planning for a new poverty survey in 2005, while the census in Sikka has a very high probability of failing to produce satisfactory results
All have been plagued with weak methodology and inadequate personnel training
II
PURPOSE OF STUDY In the quest to introduce a better monitoring tool in Indonesia, SMERU Research Institute proposed to pilot test a poverty monitoring system that is easy to collect, gives objective results, is sensitive to locally specific characteristics, and gives intuitive and speedy results
Since the system heavily involves local residents, the system is called Community Based Monitoring System (CBMS)
Funding for the pilot is provided by the International Development Research Center, Canada through the CBMS Network Coordinating Team which is based at the Angelo King Institute for Economic and Business Studies, De La Salle University, Manila
There are several major differences between CBMS and the traditional poverty monitoring system
Firstly, CBMS uses a questionnaire that is simple enough to be conducted by locals, which means it utilizes the advantage of local knowledge
As a result, village officials and residents can process and calculate several village-level indicators, such as those related to employment, education, health, and sanitation, and can readily work with government officials to overcome problems
Secondly, since the locals can start analyzing a part of the information without having to wait for it to be processed and analyzed at higher government levels, results could be available in relatively shorter time and can speedily be acted upon
Thirdly, CBMS is sensitive to locally-specific conditions
This is very important because poverty conditions are often locally-specific
By being sensitive to local conditions, CBMS can provide guidance for the right policy to reduce poverty in an area
In contrast, other poverty monitoring systems usually use a universal set of poverty indicators for the whole country, which is often proved ineffective due to the complications posed by regional heterogeneity
Finally, the data collected through the questionnaire can be sent to district level governments to be used for various purposes, such as budget allocation and program targeting
As a targeting tool and by utilizing a methodology called Principal Components Analysis (PCA), the data can be used to create a composite index that summarizes all the multidimensional aspects of poverty into a single figure for every family in a village
As a result, government officials can rank families in a village based on their welfare
The indicators currently used for targeting only classify families into poor and non-poor, so there is no detailed breakdown on which families are the poorest among the poor
With family ranking based on welfare, government officials would have the information on which family is the poorest or which families are the 10% poorest families in the village
This information would significantly improve targeting of government poverty alleviation programs, reducing leakage and undercoverage
We use a household questionnaire for collecting household data, where both household head and the female member/s of the family would be the respondents for the respective relevant portions
Village level information is elicited using a structured checklist
A common grievance of BKKBN data is that it could be easily tampered with
To remedy this, the variables that we gather record more detailed household characteristics; village leaders and enumerators would not know the weighting/importance of each variable until it is processed; and tampering with data after processing would render the alreadyprocessed weightings obsolete, thus making the results invalid
In short, the data and the processing method that we use ensure that data-tampering is harder and the result more objective
III
COLLABORATION WITH BKKBN SMERU intended to collaborate with BKKBN from the beginning of the project because of several reasons
Firstly, BKKBN is experienced in conducting household-level census
In almost every village in Indonesia, it has cadres at the neighborhood level who are still collecting BKKBN data annually
Secondly, since BKKBN will continue to collect annual household level data, they are the agency which will benefit the most from the improved CBMS
Thirdly, in the long run SMERU hopes that local government will take charge of the monitoring process, which means a sense of ownership needs to be established from the outset
Furthermore, there is a greater chance that local government will formally adopt the CBMS if SMERU works together with a government agency rather than working alone
IV
CBMS VILLAGES The pilot project is restricted to the province of Java
Two kabupaten are selected, one where BKKBN is still in place and the other where BKKBN is no longer institutionalized
The first one is Cianjur in West Java and the other is Demak in Central Java
From each kabupaten we choose two kecamatan, and one village in each kecamatan, making a total of four villages
Every household in the villages is visited
The kecamatan chosen takes into account the distance from the kabupaten capital
One kecamatan is far from the Kabupaten capital whereas the other will be near
The sample is not meant to be representative of the kabupaten or kecamatan
The villages chosen in Cianjur are Parakantugu in Kecamatan Cijati and Cibulakan in Kecamatan Cugenang
While the villages that will be visited in Demak are Jungpasir in Kecamatan Wedung and Kedondong in Kecamatan Demak
Basic information on each village is in Table IV.2
V
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY In order to measure welfare as accurately as possible, the ideal would be to collect consumption expenditure data of each household
The difficulty in collecting such data however, has been widely recognized
In addition, consumption data could be unreliable and could over/underestimate household welfare
In order to avoid this problem, we shall estimate long-run household wealth using a procedure introduced and defended by Filmer and Pritchett (“Estimating Wealth”)
This method proposed the use of Principal Components Analysis (PCA), which takes advantage of asset ownership information such as house condition, toilet facilities, etc as an alternative to recording detailed consumption expenditure
Since the result of estimating welfare using assets was only slightly different to using detailed consumption expenditure but much easier to collect, Filmer and Pritchett argued that their method is better, especially for calculating longrun household welfare
There are four estimation for PCA
one for each village
The main advantage of using PCA is that it allows SMERU researchers to determine poverty indicators that are locally specific
This is the main difference of the CBMS compared to methodologies used by other poverty monitoring systems in Indonesia
The analysis is at the family level and the variables used are listed in Table V.1
Only dummy variables are used in order to make analysis and understanding the results simpler
The PCA results are discussed separately for each village in Sections VIII to XI
VI
OVERVIEW OF CBMS VILLAGES A
KEDONDONG Kedondong is situated 10 kilometers from the capital of Demak, consisting of three neighborhoods, with a total of 20 hamlets (sub-neighborhoods)
The village is arranged in blocks, each block is the same as one hamlet and is made up of around 60 houses
In terms of education facilities, there are four primary schools but there is no junior secondary or senior secondary school
The nearest junior secondary school is three kilometers away, while the nearest senior secondary school is five kilometers from the village
Meanwhile, the nearest tertiary level educational facility is eight kilometers away, near the district capital
Furthermore, there is no non-formal education facility available
Transportation to aforementioned education facilities is not hard because there are several regular public transportation services to the village
Although there is no permanent health facility in the village, both public and private, three midwives and two nurses visit the village at least once a week
Moreover, over-thecounter drugs are widely available in small shops throughout the village
Access in and out of the village is quite adequate
The longest road type is makadam, a local term, which means that the road is already hardened and ready to be layered with asphalt
In short, it is the type of road that is one level below asphalt road
Thus, the road is passable throughout the year
Public transportation such as minivans and motorcycletaxis are available everyday for at least eight hours
In terms of sanitation, most residents bathe in a small river that runs on the west side of the village
This is quite surprising, given the village's proximity to the district capital and the availability of piped water system in every house
A resident told one SMERU researcher that only the very rich use private bathrooms, while most families, including those who can afford to build a private bathroom, still use the river because they can socially interact with their neighbors while bathing
In contrast, virtually everybody drinks water from the piped system
For energy source, firewood is the source of cooking fuel used by most villagers, followed by kerosene and gas stoves
Meanwhile, every house is connected to the state energy company, although there are houses whose connection is through another house and not directly from the power company
Only around one percent of the residents have private land line telephone and even fewer have cellular phones, however, public telecommunication booths are available in the village
On the other hand, there is no post office and the nearest one is located six kilometers away
The only formal banks available in the village are government owned
BKK, a bank owned by the provincial government that specializes in providing credits to micro and small enterprises, and BKD, a smaller version of BKK owned by the village government
There is no other formal financial institution available in the village, although there are mobile banks and loan sharks that regularly visit the village
B
JUNGPASIR Jungpasir is one of 20 villages in the subdistrict of Wedung, in the district of Demak
The village is divided into five neighborhoods, with a total of 11 hamlets, and lies on the border of Demak and Jepara, a district east of Demak
It is located 25 kilometers from the district capital, and around 15 kilometers from the subdistrict capital
Jungpasir is located far from the state road (roads built by the central government) that connects Demak to Jepara
Within the village itself, main roads are made from rough asphalt
The road shows considerable wear and tear and lack of maintenance
Public transportation, however, regularly pass through the village all day round, providing service to Demak and Jepara
There are two main roads that lead to Jungpasir
The faster way is to take the state road to Jepara and through the side road along a river that separates Jepara from Demak
The condition of the side road in Jepara is, in contrast to side roads in Demak, very well maintained, so the trip to Jungpasir would only take one hour
The second path is to go through the capital of Wedung
The trip, however, would take more than two hours because of the atrocious road condition
According to Statistics Indonesia's Village Potential database, in 2003 Jungpasir had an area of 353.1 hectares, where most (306.5 hectares) were paddy fields
Residential area only took up around 30 hectares and was clustered along the main village road
Other uses of land include public facilities, religious facilities, funeral grounds, etc
As already shown by the proportion of land use, most residents are paddy farmers, either simply owning the paddy field, working in the field, or both
Other types of occupation include fruit or food trading
Most residents who work in this sector ply their trade in Demak, Jepara, or even Jakarta
On access to sanitation, 70% of residents get their drinking water from wells, both protected and unprotected, while the rest use tap water provided by the provincial water company
As for source of light, every house uses electricity provided by the state power company
Meanwhile, most residents also have their own toilets
Although there are still quite a few who use the river or their neighbor's toilet
For a village that is far from the district capital, educational facilities are readily available
There are three primary schools, one private junior secondary school and one private senior secondary school
The nearest public junior secondary school is only five minutes away, while other senior secondary schools and tertiary level education facilities are only available in the district capital
The only available formal health facility is a public polyclinic that has a midwife and a nurse
In addition, there are also two traditional midwives
For medical doctors, both general practitioner or specialist, the residents would have to go to Demak
In terms of telecommunication facilities, a small share of residents have private land line telephone
There are, however, also six telecommunication kiosks in the village
Other public facilities such as market, post office, and bank are not yet available in the village
The nearest market is in a neighboring village, which is technically already in Jepara, while the nearest post office is in the subdistrict capital and the nearest bank is in the district capital
Access to financial institutions, however, is easy because there are two small cooperatives in Jungpasir that provide similar services to a bank
C
CIBULAKAN Cibulakan is one of 16 villages in Cugenang subdistrict in Cianjur
The village is separated into three main residential blocks, in total comprising of six neighborhoods and 22 hamlets
The first five neighborhoods are located on the side of the village road, while the sixth neighborhood is located about two kilometers from the village road, surrounded by paddy fields
The village is about six kilometers away from the capital of Cianjur and four kilometers from the capital of Cugenang
Although not located adjacent to intercity roads, this village can be accessed from two such roads
Cianjur-Jakarta and Cianjur-Sukabumi
Both roads are around 20 minutes by car from the village
Meanwhile, the road from the intercity roads to the village is relatively well-maintained, although quite narrow
This road has enabled public transportation—minibus—to service the village
This significantly helps the residents in getting to Cianjur
Other than minibus, another public transportation roaming the village is motorcycle taxi that specializes in short distance travel
These taxis are especially used by the residents of Neighborhood 6, which is not serviced by the minibus
In addition, the road that leads to the hamlet can only be utilized by motorcycles during the rainy season
According to latest data from Statistics Indonesia, in 2003 the area of Cibulakan was 200 hectares
The largest area, 138.3 ha, was used to cultivate paddy throughout the year
Meanwhile, the residential area took about 34.3 ha
The rest was used for fish ponds and public facilities
Most residents work as farmers; some own fields but do not work them, some work the fields that they own, and some work as farm laborers for others since they do not own any land
Most farmers plant paddy, while a few plant vegetables or farm fish
Other than farming, other occupations include trading, working at private companies, becoming a civil servant, and driving the minibuses or motorcycle taxis
Quite a large number of residents work as migrant workers, especially in Middle Eastern countries
Families of these foreign workers are relatively better off compared to other residents
In general, people still use wells and springs as their main source of drinking water although the provincial water company (PDAM) is already servicing the area, which means most houses have access to purified tap water
Those whose houses have no tap water are able to bring buckets and take water for free from taps at the local mosque
For source of light, virtually every house has access to electricity, although there are a few that still use oil-based lamps or torches
Many residents have separate bathroom and toilet facilities
Most houses have a bathroom, albeit very simple ones that only consist of a bathtub that doubles as a fish pond, and also private toilet
A small number of families use public toilets, and an even smaller number still use the river for bathing and as a lavatory
There are only limited education facilities in the village
There are four public primary schools and a private junior secondary school
Other schools, however, are relatively close
There is a public junior secondary school in the neighboring subdistrict, and a number of senior secondary schools and colleges are available in the capital of Cianjur
Furthermore, locally managed Islamic boarding schools (pesantren) are also available in the village
There are also no public health facilities in the village
The only one available is already abandoned
There are, however, two nurses who have opened for private practice in their homes and also a village midwife
Telecommunication facilities are quite widely available
A fixed telephone network is available from the state telecom, although the number of subscribers is quite small
Meanwhile, there is a telecommunication kiosk available for the used of residents
In contrast, cellular phones have been gathering popularity
This is supported by a number of factors
availability of affordable phones, relatively good signal, and the very low airtime charges
Other larger forms of infrastructure such as market, post office, police station, and bank are not yet available
Residents have to go to the capital of Cianjur for these services, although a bank is also available in the subdistrict capital
For credit purposes, residents usually go to this bank, the state pawn company, or the microfinance unit of Kecamatan Development Program (KDP)
D
PARAKANTUGU Prior to 2005, Parakantugu was a part of Kadupandak Subdistrict
In January 2005, there was a segregation of the subdistrict into two subdistricts
Kadupandak and Cijati
Parakantugu was included as a part of the new subdistrict
Parakantugu is located along Cibuni River, which regularly floods the village during the rainy season
The village is about 90 kilometers from Cianjur capital and five kilometers from Cijati capital
Ironically, it is only two kilometers away from Kadupandak capital
It takes around four to five hours by car from Cianjur capital to Parakantugu
There are three routes that can be taken
Cianjur – Sukanagara – Kadupandak – Parakantugu
This route is the worst because there is around 15 kilometers of atrocious road condition near Kadupandak
This route, however, is passed by public transportation
Cianjur – Sukanagara – Tanggeung – Cigadog – Parakantugu
This route is also in a bad condition where for about 20 kilometers there is only dirt road covered with stone
This route is also passed by public transportation
Cianjur – Sukanagara – Wedung – Parakantugu
Wedung – Parakantugu is a motorcycle-taxi-only road
Other public transportation is not allowed to pass after scuffles broke out several years ago between minibus drivers and the motorcycle taxi drivers
This is the best route to get to Parakantugu if one drives a private car, although the road is quite narrow
Parakantugu residents have easy access to public transportation from within their village, both minibus and motorcycle taxi, although it is not available around the clock
Minibuses only operate between 6 am to 4 pm, while motorcycle taxis are mainly used for intra-village travel
The main road in Parakantugu is not well maintained
It is a mix of stone road, dirt road, and patches of asphalt
Smaller roads leading into residents' houses, however, are all asphalted using KDP fund
Unfortunately, there is no maintenance fund and it is only a matter of time before these roads deteriorate
According to Statistics Indonesia in 2003, Parakantugu had an area of 351 hectares
Sixty percent of the area was paddy field, which yields one harvest per year due to the long dry season
The residential area took up about 17.4% of total area
Most residents were born in the village
There are very few migrants from other areas
Most residents work as paddy farmers
A small portion work as traders, civil servants, and employees
There are also pensioners
Most younger people work as construction workers, porters, and motorcycle taxi drivers
In addition, many women in the village work as overseas workers, mainly in Saudi Arabia
Going away to work overseas is traditionally quite normal among residents, since most older people also have such experience
There is no health facility in the village, although there is a village midwife
There are also three traditional midwives, whose services are in demand
The nearest public health center is in Kadupandak, about 15 minutes away by motorcycle, and the residents have to go to Cianjur to get more modern health treatment
In terms of education facilities, there are four public primary schools and one private junior secondary school
The nearest senior secondary school is one hour away by car, which is the reason why most school age children drop out after finishing junior secondary school
VII
QUANTITATIVE PROFILE OF CBMS VILLAGES This section provides profiles of CBMS villages, divided into six categories
A
POPULATION Table VII.1 provides the population characteristics of the four CBMS villages
There are 1,428 families in Cibulakan, with an average family size of 4.5 persons
This is a bit higher than BKKBN's ideal family size of 4
Meanwhile, 53% of the residents are male, while 14.3% of families are headed by females, usually widows and divorcees
There are 1,295 families in Parakantugu
The average family size is ideal, 3.8 people per family
There are slightly more males than females in the village, and 13% of families are female-headed
As is the case with other villages, these are usually single-parent families
Kedondong also has a relatively small average family size, 3.7, which means that the target of the national family planning program of two children per family is well within range
Meanwhile, 12.1% of the families are female-headed
Sixty percent of these families are single-parent families, mostly families headed by old widows and widowed/divorced mothers with one or two children
In Jungpasir, there are 1,272 families
Average family size is quite large, 4.7 persons per family
There are equal numbers of males and females in Jungpasir
Meanwhile, only 15% of the families have female heads, mostly widows or divorced females
B
OCCUPATION AND EDUCATION Table VII.2 provides occupation characteristics and employment rates in the four villages
Some 93.7% of family heads in Cibulakan are working
Of families whose head is not working, there are usually other members who are working
There are, however, 5% of families that have no working member
These are usually single-parent families that receive transfers from their relatives
The employment rate in Cibulakan is quite low, especially among females
In total, only a little more than half of adult residents are working
The employment rate among adult females is at a very low 27.8%
As already mentioned in Section VI, the largest type of occupation is in the agriculture sector, followed by services sector
In Parakantugu 94.8% of family heads are employed and they are usually the only source of income in a family, which is shown by the fact that 65.1% families only have one breadwinner
Meanwhile, 26.1% have two sources of income, usually family head with spouse or a child
As already mentioned in Section VI, almost half of the population are employed in the agricultural sector
Around 24.9% work in the services sector, mainly as drivers, construction workers, and teachers
The others are working in small industry or opening small shops
There are also families that receive transfers
The employment rate among the working age population in Parakantugu is quite low, where only 56.4% are working
The female employment rate is even lower, 30.4%, while male employment rate is at 82.1%
This is in line with the observation that the role of males as breadwinners is quite ingrained, while most females stay at home
In Kedondong, the employment rate of family head is 96.5%, which means virtually every family in the village has at least one member who is working
This is also shown by the number of working family members, where only 2.9% of families have no working member
Meanwhile, almost half have two members who are working
It is interesting, however, to note that the overall crude employment rate of working-age residents is only 76.4%, with males and females at 88.8% and 63.7% respectively
The majority of residents are in the agriculture sector, which is quite the norm in rural Java
Most of the residents working in the services sector are taxi and bus drivers and construction workers
Finally, those receiving transfers consist of pensioners and senior couples receiving regular money transfers from their already-married children
From Table VII.2 one can also gather that only 2.6% of family heads in Jungpasir are unemployed
This is further strengthened by the fact that only 1.8% of families do not have any working members
The families that are included in the 1.8% classification are usually single-parent families that receive transfers from other families
The same table shows that the male employment rate is much higher than female's
This could be caused by the fact that females concentrate more on taking care of the family
Based on the number of working family member, almost half the families in Jungpasir (45.5%) have two members who are working, while 23.9% of the families have three or more working members
Meanwhile, most residents are in trade (41.1%) and agriculture (39.1%) sectors, and only 13.2% are in the services sector
There seem to be district specific conditions that affect employment
In Cianjur, the employment rate is lower than Demak
indicated by the fact that more families in the two villages in Cianjur only have one working member
In contrast, around half the families in Demak have two members who are working
Meanwhile, Table VII.3 provides the literacy rate and education level of the working-age population in these villages
In Cibulakan, almost every adult is literate, with males having a higher literacy rate (97.9%) compared to females (94.2%)
In terms of education level, adults in Cibulakan have a relatively low level of education
The majority, 70.3% only finished primary school, with 10.9% not even finishing primary level
Only 2.2% have tertiary-level education
Most adults in Parakantugu are literate and there is a very high literacy rate among both males and females
Those who are illiterate can also be easily identified from the percentage of adults not finishing primary school, although there are few of those who did not finish primary but are literate
Education levels among the working age population are quite low
Some 70.8% have only six years of education, with a higher percentage of females than males having only attained this level of education
A higher share of males than females have also finished higher levels of education
It seems that males, in general, have more opportunity for higher education
In Kedondong, the male literacy rate is 90.8% while the female literacy rate is 10 percentage points lower at 80.8%
Overall, 85.8% of adults can read and write
Some 83.7% of working age residents have six years of education or less
Only 1.5% have a tertiary level of education
This is consistent with the sector of employment in the village, where 58% families derive their main income from agriculture
Finally in Jungpasir, the education level of the working age population is also relatively low, although it is more scattered compared to other villages
Only 13.8% of the population have finished senior secondary school and just 1.5% have a tertiary level of education
Moreover, 27.3% did not even finish primary school
Around 15% of them are illiterate, and more females are illiterate compared to males
Those who are illiterate are usually adults who have not read for extended periods
Although they used to be able to read when they were young, they no longer have the ability
After looking at the education level of the working-age population, Table VII.4 shows the net enrollment rates of each education level
The primary enrollment rates in the two villages in Cianjur are relatively low compared to the villages in Demak
In Cibulakan, the primary net enrollment rate is only 78.7%, while the junior secondary enrollment rate plunges to 42.7% and the senior secondary net enrollment rate is only 20.7%
The female primary enrollment rate is higher than males, but females' rates are lower in both secondary levels
Observations indicate that the low enrollment rates in Cibulakan are because education is still relatively unaffordable for many residents and parents are unaware of the importance of a formal education
Distance does not seem to be an important barrier, because all educational facilities, from primary to tertiary schools, are at most 30 minutes away from the village
Net enrollment rates for primary and junior secondary schools in Parakantugu are 77% and 80.1% respectively, while the senior secondary net enrollment rate dives to 18.9%, mainly caused by the unavailability of nearby senior secondary schools
Meanwhile, female net enrollment rates are lower in all three levels of schooling
The net primary school enrollment rate in Kedondong is high, 91.5%, although is slightly lower than the national net enrollment rate of 93% (UNDP)
Meanwhile, the net junior and senior secondary school enrollment rates are 64.9% and 26.6% respectively, which indicates that many students drop out of school after finishing a level, either after finishing primary level or junior secondary level, rather than midway through a level
Looking at net enrollment rates between boys and girls, girls have a higher rate only at the primary level, and the gap between boys and girls' rates increases at higher levels of education
In Jungpasir, the net enrollment rate in primary and junior secondary levels are quite high, at 95.2% and 95.9% respectively, while it is 64% at senior secondary level
The drop out rate after junior secondary school is caused by, inter alia, an inability to finance education, but in addition there is a tendency among residents to choose public schools
This is not a problem at the junior secondary level since a public school is available in the village, but is at the senior secondary level since the nearest public school is in the district capital
Overall, net enrollment rates among boys and girls are similar, although boys still have higher rates, especially at the senior secondary level
Since schooling, or lack of it, is possibly related to child labor, Table VII.5 breaks down the activity of school age children in the four villages into the four combinations of schooling and working
As shown by Table VII.5, child drop out in Cibulakan begins at a very early stage
Some 21.3% of children between six and 12 years old are out of school
The drop out rate continues to increase in higher levels, 57.3% and a staggering 79.3% among junior and secondary-age school children respectively
The table shows, however, that those who drop out are not necessarily engaged in employment
In total only 0.8%, 7%, and 23.8% of school age children at each level actually work
The third column shows that virtually no school-going children are working, while the last column shows that more than half of all children aged 13 to 18 are neither working nor in school
The drop out rate in Parakantugu mirrors the net enrollment rate in Table VII.4
Interestingly, most of those who dropped out are not working, which shows that children drop out not so much because schooling is unaffordable but because of other factors
In Kedondong, 1.5% of primary school age children are working, while almost half of senior secondary school age children are working
The village has the highest share of school age children working compared to the other three
Furthermore, the table also shows that only a very small fraction of children are both working and in school, the highest is 2.4% at the junior secondary level
This proves that work and school are also virtually two mutually exclusive activities in Kedondong, although the rate of child labor in this village is highest compared to other villages
Finally, the table also shows that there is quite a high proportion of children who are not in school and also not working, amounting to around a quarter of children 13-18 years old and 8% of 6-12 year old children
In the meantime, children in Jungpasir have dropped out of school even at the primary level, and it increases up to senior secondary level
Although the proportion is relatively small, there are 0.3% and 2.4% of primary and junior secondary school age children who have stopped going to school and are working
In contrast, there are no children at the primary and junior secondary levels who are both in school and working, while 2% of those in senior secondary school age engage in work and school at the same time
C
HEALTH AND FOOD CONSUMPTION PATTERN Table VII.6 provides the health-related characteristics of the villages, including contraceptive usage rate, immunization rate, access to formal medical treatment, and access to safe drinking water
The contraceptive usage rate in Cibulakan is relatively low at 52.6%
The most widely used contraception is through injection, followed by pill
SMERU researchers believe that the cause of this low usage rate is the expensive price of the contraceptive tools; scarceness of the tools at local level; and the culture of a small number of residents that tends to believe that limiting the number of children in a family is against Islamic teachings
Furthermore, the immunization rate is also low in Cibulakan
Only 32.6% of infants have received complete immunization, and the ratio for each type of immunization varies between 44% and 58.4%
Child delivery by doctor or midwife is also at a lowly 32.8%
This shows that most children were delivered by the traditional midwife, while a doctor or midwife is only called when the mother encounters problems
In a sense, this practice is quite understandable since traditional midwives usually charge very low fees
The majority of mothers, however, have received antenatal and postnatal treatment
For medical conditions other than pregnancy or child delivery, modern facility usage is very high
Some 91.2% of families resort to modern health facilities during illness
Moreover, virtually every family, 99.8%, drink boiled water
Finally, only 0.4% of families still live in dirt floor houses
According to the residents, the first investment that families make when they have money is to buy floor tiles
Only 58.5% of reproductive age families in Parakantugu use contraception
Furthermore, immunization is also still far from universal, although much higher than Cibulakan
Rates for compulsory immunizations such as BCG, DPT, and Polio are less than 70%, while other types of immunization have less than a 60% prevalence rate
In total, a little more than half the infants received complete immunization
Furthermore, three-quarters of infants were delivered by doctor/midwife and similarly around 75% of mothers received antenatal and postnatal treatment
Almost 90% of families seek modern medical treatment during sickness and every family in Parakantugu drinks boiled water
In addition, only 0.3% families still live in dirt floor houses
In Kedondong, although many residents still take a bath in nearby rivers, 96.8% of the families drink safe drinking water and 95% of them sought formal medical treatment during sickness
Meanwhile, 76.3% of fertile couples use contraceptive tools
explains the low average family size in the village
Immunization rates among infants are still relatively low, although most vaccines are provided free of charge by the government
Some 58.3% of infants have received complete immunization, while 20% of infants have not received polio vaccination
Some 76% of infants were delivered by a doctor or midwife, while the rest were delivered using traditional methods
Furthermore, 86% of mothers received antenatal treatment and around 77% received postnatal treatment
These conditions can probably best be explained by the fact that there is no permanent health facility in the village
Nevertheless, the residents are still in a better situation compared to other more remote villages since the district capital is only a short trip away by bus
Finally, almost half of the families still live in houses with dirt floors
From Table VII.6 one sees that in Jungpasir only 66.2% of couples in reproductive age use contraceptive tools and mostly used injection
There are still quite a high percentage (32.5%) of infants that did not receive complete immunization
When examined from each type of immunization, around 75% – 88% of children are immunized
Formal medical treatment usage is quite high in Jungpasir
Some 86% of infants were delivered by doctor or midwife
In virtually every pregnancy, mothers receive antenatal and postnatal treatment
Moreover, 94% of families have used modern medical facilities when ill
Finally, 99% of families drink boiled water, although 28.4% still live in dirt floored houses
To look at the consumption pattern among families in the four villages, Table VII.7 provides information on the number of meals a family usually has in a day and their consumption of meat, fish, and egg
In general, the family consumption pattern in all four villages is quite favorable
Almost every family eats at least twice daily
Regular meat consumption, however, is only prevalent in Parakantugu, while the rate hovers around 50% in the other three villages
Egg consumption is relatively high in all four villages, while fish consumption is lowest in Cibulakan, which is landlocked, compared to the other three villages, which are relatively closer to a river or sea
D
FINANCIAL CHARACTERISTICS Financial characteristics are looked at in four aspects, as shown in Table VII.8
As already written in Section VI.C, there is no formal credit institution in Cibulakan
Thus, residents who want to apply for credit must go to the BRI (Bank Rakyat Indonesia, Indonesian People's Bank) at the capital of Cugenang or to other financial institutions in the district capital
An estimate of 9.8% of Cibulakan families have received formal credit in the past three years, almost exclusively given by banks
For informal credit, on the other hand, residents usually borrow from their neighbors
Meanwhile, 14.1% of families have savings
Since the number of families who have savings is much higher than those who have credit, the banking system has moved capital from rural to urban areas
Another way of securing money is by mortgaging assets
Some 4.1% of families have done so in the past three years and 2.7% of families had to sell assets to pay off debt
Residents of Parakantugu usually go to BRI in Kadupandak when dealing with formal financial institutions
Some 12.6% of families have received formal credit and 11.6% have savings
Only a small percentage, 0.9%, have pawned their assets, while 1.1% of families had to sell their assets to pay back debt
Although Kedondong is only eight kilometers away from the district capital and there are formal financial institutions available in the village, only a small portion of families have a relationship with them, although admittedly they have the highest rates compared to the other three villages
Table VII.8 shows that less than a quarter of families have taken out formal credit in the last three years and only 16% have savings
On the other hand, 2.5% of the families pawned their assets in the past three years, while 3.1% were so heavily indebted they had to sell their assets
Although there are two cooperatives in Jungpasir, only 6.4% of families have secured loans in the past three years
According to interviews with residents, most of those who received loans obtained them from banks, while the cooperatives are only the thirdchoice institution after banks and informal moneylenders, such as loan sharks
Some 15.6% of families have savings
Finally the percentage of families that have pawned their assets is relatively small, around 1.7%
2.2% of families have sold their assets to pay for debts
E
POLITICAL PARTICIPATION, SAFETY, AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION According to several people in Cibulakan there have been several break-ins in the past year, mostly done by locals themselves
They believe this is caused by the fact that there is an increasing number of teenagers who have dropped out from school and cannot secure employment
This is in accordance with the data shown in Table VII.5, where half of children aged 13 to 18 in Cibulakan are neither in school nor working
Table VII.9 shows that 2.8% of families were victims of crime in the past year, virtually all of them had their houses broken into
On the other hand, the other three villages are quite safe with less than one percent of residents suffering from crime, and most of these cases happening outside the village
Residents in all villages are also politically active
More than 98% of the adults voted
This does seem to have been caused by the easy access to information
However, political participation in Parakantugu remained high although only around 75% of residents regularly watch television or read newspapers
F
BKKBN STATUS AND SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS Since BKKBN status is the official tool for identifying poor family, it is important to see the share of each classification in each village and the distribution of the social safety net program beneficiaries
Officially, only families in the two lowest categories (Preprosperous and Prosperous I) are entitled to receive the social safety net (SSN) programs
There are only 6.7% of families in Cibulakan who are classified as Pre-prosperous, while there is no Prosperous III+ family
Some 37.1% are classified as Prosperous I, so in theory, 44% of residents in the village should receive SSN programs
In practice, one observes both undercoverage and leakage
only 72.6% and 68.5% of residents in the two respective lowest categories received Rice for the Poor program (RP), while 38.2% and 15.6% of Prosperous II and III respectively received it
In terms of number of families, the number of Pre-prosperous families who received the program is less than the number of Prosperous I and II families who benefited from the program
Similar phenomenon can be seen from the distribution of health card for the Poor program (HCP) beneficiary
Moreover, the number of non-poor families receiving the program is also greater than the number of Pre-prosperous families receiving it
In Parakantugu, 33.9% and 41.5% of families are classified in the two lowest classes, while 7% are in the two highest categories
There is more undercoverage than leakage in Parakantugu, with only 22.1% and 17.7% of eligible families in the two lowest categories respectively receiving subsidized rice
Meanwhile, leakage is more apparent in the health card program, where 8.1% of rich families benefited from it while only 5.5% and 3.7% of families entitled to the program received it
In Kedondong, the poverty rate based on BKKBN is 50.3%, while 76.8% families are entitled to government assistance
We found that close to 95% of those who are supposed to receive RP received them, implying the existence of undercoverage
But more worryingly we also found that 76% and 64% of families classified in the two highest BKKBN categories also received the aid
Overall, around 70% of the non-poor benefited from the program
This is consistent with information from residents who state that the subsidized rice is usually distributed among the residents, irrespective of status
Only 20% of the poor received HCP and around 10% of non-poor families received Health Care Cards under the program
Overall, we found undercoverage and considerable leakage of both the RP and HCP programs
Table VII.10 also shows that Jungpasir has a high poverty incidence; 23% of the families are classified as pre-prosperous, while almost half are in the Prosperous I category
Only 4.6% of the families in Jungpasir are classified in the top two categories
Looking at access to government assistance programs, whose intended targets are families in the bottom two categories, families from every category benefit from the program
The share of families receiving the programs decreases from the lowest to the Prosperous III category, and then increases again in the highest category, where every Prosperous III+ family received subsidized rice
Village officials admitted that the Rice for the Poor program is evenly divided among residents to avoid any jealousy that may lead to conflict
This result shows that the targeting mechanism is still inadequate
Many reasons can be thought of, starting from weak methodology to corrupt officials on the ground, as well as demands by the rich residents to also receive the programs
This means much improvement could be made to ensure better targeting
The next four sections discuss the PCA results in each village as we provide evidence that PCA has the potential to improve targeting methodology

PCA RESULT
POVERTY PROFILE OF KEDONDONG A
SIGNIFICANT INDICATORS OF WELFARE Out of the 63 welfare indicators listed in Table V.1, the most positive variable is owning a color television and the most negative variable is if the family has a female head
provides the 10 welfare indicators with the highest coefficients, either positive or negative
Asset ownership variables make up six of the 10 variables in the table, which means they best differentiate a family's welfare from the others
Meanwhile, the two variables with negative coefficients that make it to the list are living in a dirt floor house and having a female family head
The richest family has a welfare score of 8.98 and the poorest family's score is -7.98
The richest family's head is a male with a university degree, the spouse also has a university degree, and the family is in the services sector
On the other hand, the poorest family is headed by a female who did not finish primary school and is unemployed
The next section describes the characteristics of the top 10% and bottom 10% of families in Kedondong
B
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RICHEST AND POOREST FAMILIES Characteristics of the richest and poorest 10% of families in Kedondong are listed in
Since it is already clear that asset ownership causes the most difference in welfare conditions, we only discuss other differences in the characteristics of the rich and the poor in Kedondong
In terms of education, only 20.3% of the poor families' heads finished primary school with none having higher levels of education levels
In contrast, almost 60% of the rich families' heads finished primary school, with almost 30% also having finished junior or senior secondary schools, and close to 10% having completed tertiary education
There are almost no rich families whose heads have less than six years of education
The gap between the rich and the poor is even wider in terms of education level of the spouses
In occupation characteristics, virtually every rich families' head is working, compared to only 75% of the poor families' heads
Moreover, 74% of the spouses in rich families also work, while only 3% of those from poor families are working
The incidence of schoolage children in the labor force is the same between rich and poor families
Almost half of the rich families are in the services sector, a further quarter in the trade sector, and only 14% are in agriculture
In contrast, 68% of poor families are in the agriculture sector and almost a quarter are unemployed
When looked at from the perspective of access to formal financial institutions, 64% of the rich families have savings, while only 0.7% of the poor families do
Moreover, close to half of the rich families have taken out credit from formal institutions and only 2% of the poor families have done so
This, however, could be endogenous as the rich families can take out credits simply because they are rich
The other two variables in the financial variable group also show glaring differences between rich and poor families
Some 6.5% of rich families have pawned assets, while only 0.7% of the poor families have done so
Again, this could stem from the fact that the poor have no assets to be pawned
Similarly, 5% of the rich families have had to sell assets to pay debt, while only 2.9% of the poor have had to
From the perspective of food consumption and health indicators, the largest difference is in meat consumption
Eighty-six percent of rich families eat meat every week, while only a quarter of poor families do so
The percentage of families seeking modern medical treatment is high for both types of families, although there is a 14 percentage point difference
On the other hand, 93% of rich families have their own toilets, while only 12% poor families have private toilets
Similarly, 80% of the poor live in dirt floor houses while only 3.6% of the rich live there
An interesting fact is that among rich families, 8.6% of them have at least one child dropping out of school while the rate is much lower among poor families at 1.5%
This might again be endogenous to their condition, although one would have to do more investigation in order to determine the causes
Finally, both families show no big differences in terms of political participation and access to information, although rich families still have higher rates of participation in both activities

PCA RESULT
POVERTY PROFILE OF JUNGPASIR A
SIGNIFICANT INDICATORS OF WELFARE lists the 10 indicators that have the highest coefficients in Jungpasir from the estimated 63 indicators
Since the score of the 9th to 11th indicators are only slightly different, the table also includes the 11th indicator
From the table it is evident that nine of the highest indicators are asset ownership
This shows that asset ownership, especially ownership of electronic goods and motorcycles, acts as the best differentiator of welfare between families
Out of the eleven indicators, only one is negative living in a dirt floored house
The richest family has a welfare score of 6.94, while the poorest has a score of -7.33
B
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RICHEST AND POOREST FAMILIES Table IX.2 provides the characteristics of the 10% richest families compared to the 10% poorest families based on the 63 indicators of welfare
As was the case with Table VIII.2, Table IX.2 shows that there is a huge gap in terms of asset ownership between the rich and the poor
No family among the poorest 10% has a refrigerator, telephone, AC, satellite dish, computer, or car
Only a very small percentage of the poor have a fan, DVD/VCD player, color television, radio, tape recorder or motorcycle
All those things are owned by most of the rich
The only assets that are widely owned by the rich and the poor are land and house
The poor might inherit these assets because these are the most prized assets in the village
A second probability, however, is that the size of land/house owned by the rich is much larger than the poor's
Not many families, however, own large farm animals like cows and sheep since Jungpasir is mainly a paddy farming village
According to marital status, almost every rich family still has a head and a spouse (98.4%), while only 30.7% of the poor families are married and the rest are made up of single-member families, usually old-aged widows
The education level of family heads from the rich families is also higher than the poor families
Some 81.3% of rich families' head finished formal schooling, where 14.8% finished senior secondary school, and almost 11% possess some tertiary level qualification
In contrast, only 15.8% of family heads among poor families finished formal schooling (12.6% finished primary school, 3.2% finished junior secondary school), while the rest have less than six years of education
Education levels of spouses show a relatively similar picture
Some 94.5% of spouses in rich families finished formal schooling, compared to 30.7% among poor families
Furthermore, 24.2% of spouses in rich families finished senior secondary school and 21.1% graduated from academy/university
Among the poor only 3.9% finished junior secondary school and 3.2% finished senior secondary school
In terms of occupation, the heads of rich families are all employed, while the poor only have a 77.2% employment rate
Furthermore, 85.9% of spouses among rich families also work, while only 8.7% of spouses in poor families work
There is no child labor among the rich, while 1.6% of children from poor families are working
Children from poor families might be forced to work in order to support their family
Around a quarter of the poor families are unemployed and rely on transfers
Meanwhile, most rich families (74%) are in the trade sector and 14% are in the services sector
Only 8.7% and 6.3% of poor families are engaged in those two sectors respectively
On the other hand, only 7.8% of rich families are in agriculture sector, compared to 58.3% among the poor
This result can generate two opposing policy implications
First, the agriculture sector should be developed further to increase the welfare of those in the sector, or, second, agricultural families need to move to trade or services in order for them to increase their welfare
Most rich families have savings in formal institutions, while almost no poor families have savings
Unlike rich families, no poor family has ever pawned any assets or received credit from formal financial institutions
This possibly happens because the poor have no asset to be pawned or to act as collateral
There are, however, poor families that have to sell assets to settle their credits
Although almost all poor families eat twice daily (92.9%), only 16.5% of them regularly consume meat
In contrast, 87.5% of rich families regularly consume meat
Although egg and fish consumption is relatively high in both types of families, the difference in prevalence of fish and egg consumption between the rich and the poor are still 22.8 and 33.1 percentage points respectively
There is no discernible difference in terms of formal health facility usage among the rich and the poor
Furthermore, the poor even have lower prevalence of health problems in some indicators
For example, there is no infant death among the poor but 3% of rich families experienced it
Most rich families, however, use drinking water taken from a protected source, while only 37% of poor families do so
In general, rich families use their own toilet, but only 21.3% of poor families have their own toilet
Although almost every family has sufficient per capita house size, 67.7% of the poor still live in dirt floored houses
Interestingly, the share of rich families that have children who dropped out of school is 2.3 percentage points higher than poor families
There are some possible causes of this phenomenon
fewer school age children in poor families; low preference for school among rich children; or lower recognition of the importance of education among rich families
The last conjecture might be implausible since the education level of the parents in rich families is relatively high
The first conjecture might have some truth in it, since 11.7% of rich families have high dependency rates, compared to 3.2% in poor families
Rich families, however, have significantly higher incomes, shown by their asset ownership and other indicators
In Jungpasir every family has access to electricity
Meanwhile, 1.6% of rich families suffered from criminal acts, while no poor families were victimized in the past year
This is logical since the poor may have no asset to begin with
Political participation is equally high, although only half of poor families' members have access to newspaper or television, compared to 99.2% access to information rate among rich families

PCA RESULT
POVERTY PROFILE OF CIBULAKAN A
SIGNIFICANT INDICATORS OF WELFARE
provides the 10 indicators with the highest coefficients in Cibulakan from the 63 indicators used
Eight of the 10 are ownership variables and the top five welfare indicators are ownership of electronic goods
B
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RICHEST AND POOREST FAMILIES Based on the welfare score of each family, we are able to isolate the 10% richest and poorest families
provides their characteristics to prove that there are indeed significant differences between them
There are very large gaps in asset ownership between the rich and the poor
There are 13 assets (out of 19 recorded) owned by the rich but not by the poor, for example refrigerator, telephone, fan, air conditioner, and satellite dish
Of the assets that some of the poor own, such as radio, tape recorder, and bicycle
there is a notable gap in quantity and most likely quality, however the questionnaire did not record the quality of assets
The two assets that are widely owned by both the rich and the poor are house and land
There could be several reasons
these two assets are perceived to be the most important and thus are prioritized, or these assets are passed on as inheritance
Meanwhile, farm animal ownership other than chicken is not widespread because the village is a traditional paddy producing village
Based on marital status, virtually every rich family head is still married and only 33.6% of the poor family heads are married
Most of the poor are single member families
The education level of the heads of rich families are markedly different than poor families
99.3% of rich family heads finished at least six years of formal schooling
In contrast, virtually all of the 60.8% poor family heads that went to formal schooling have only six years of education and none finished higher than junior secondary level
The gap between education levels of the rich and the poor is even wider among spouses
21% and 12.6% of spouses in poor families have six and nine years of education respectively, none higher than junior secondary level
while 30.6% of spouses in rich families have a diploma degree and 5.6% have university degrees
Only 2% have no more than a primary school education
In terms of occupation, every family head among the rich families has a job while only 60.8% of poor family heads are employed
There are, however, few working spouses among either rich or poor families
Only 27.8% and 11.9% of rich and poor spouses respectively are working
Surprisingly, 1.4% of rich families have at least one school age child who is working
Many rich families are engaged in the services and trade sectors, while a small number of poor families are in these sectors
In contrast, 54.4% of the poor families are engaged in agriculture
Only 9% of rich families are in this sector
The fact that many poor families are in agriculture can be the result of several factors, such as inadequate land and low agricultural technology
Finally, 36.4% of poor families rely on transfers to fulfill their needs, while only 4.9% of rich families receive transfers
The difference lies in the amount and type of transfer
poor families receive irregular transfers from families or friends while rich families usually receive pensions
In accordance with their asset ownership, rich families have greater access to formal financial institutions
Most rich families (67.4%) have savings accounts, while virtually no poor families have one
In the past three years, 32.6% of rich families have received credit from formal institutions and 6.3% have pawned their assets
In contrast, no poor families have either received formal credit or pawned their assets
As a consequence, however, none of the poor had to sell their assets to pay debt, while 4.9% of rich families were forced to do so
There are also considerable contrasts in terms of consumption patterns
Although just about every family eat two meals a day, the protein intake is very different
More than 90% of rich families consume meat, fish, and egg at least once a week, while only 14%, 33.6%, and 40.6% of poor families regularly consume meat, fish, and egg respectively
Health indicators between rich and poor families are also very different
An amount of 95.1% of rich families seek modern health service during sickness, while only 74.8% of poor families do so
The percentage of rich families drinking safe water is twice that of the poor
In terms of toilet facilities, 95.1% rich families have a private toilet and only 13.3% of poor families have one
The rest use public toilets or their neighbor's
Furthermore, more rich families have at least 8 m2 per capita house size and, although very few, 0.7% of poor families still live in a dirt floor house
Although the percentage of rich families suffering from infant death is 4.9 percentage points higher than for poor families, we believe the deaths among rich families are not related to poverty or lack of access to healthy living conditions
The percentage of school age children dropping out is quite high among both poor and rich families, with a rate 7.1 percentage points higher among poor families
Meanwhile, more rich families have high dependency ratios
This does not seem to matter, however, since 95.1% of rich families' members buy clothes at least once a year while only 42% of poor families do so
Electricity supply is prevalent in the village, so both the rich and the poor have access to electricity
In terms of being a crime victim, the rate is 3.5 percentage points higher among rich families
Again, this could stem from the fact that they have more assets
Political participation is equally high, above 90%, but there are marked difference in access to information
Every rich family has access to either television or newspaper, while less than half of poor families have such access

PCA RESULT
POVERTY PROFILE OF PARAKANTUGU A
SIGNIFICANT INDICATORS OF WELFARE Table XI.1 provides the 10 most welfare-differentiating variables in Parakantugu
Eight of them are ownership variables, while the other two are savings and education level of the family head
Refrigerator ownership is the variable with the highest coefficient, while a family whose head only finished six years of education would most probably be poor
B
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RICHEST AND POOREST FAMILIES Table XI.2 provides the comparison of characteristics between the rich and the poor in Parakantugu
Poor families only own black and white television and radio, while rich families own every ownership variable
Both the rich and the poor own land and house
As is the case with other villages, the house and land are usually inherited from their parents
In terms of farm animals, more poor families own chicken and goats
In terms of marital status, 95.4% of rich families have a family head and a spouse, while only 60.5% of poor families have that configuration
Only 4.7% of rich families are female headed, compared to 34.9% among poor families
The education level of the majority of rich family heads is junior or secondary senior level, while 90% of poor families' heads only have six years of education
Interestingly, however, 60% of spouses in poor families have nine years of education while almost all of the other 40% did not finish primary school
In comparison, the education levels of spouses in rich families are more evenly scattered, with more than 50% having 12 years of education or higher
In the occupation category, 99.2% of rich family heads are working and only 73.6% of poor family heads have a job
Moreover, 33.3% of rich family spouses are also working compared to 4.7% among poor family spouses
When examined by sector of employment, 70.5% of poor families are in the agricultural sector, while rich families are mostly engaged in services (50.4%) and trade (31%)
Only 11.6% of rich families are in the agricultural sector
In addition, almost a quarter of poor families rely on transfers from other parties
Access to financial institutions is exclusive to the rich, where 66% have savings and 42% have received credit
Although different, both the rich and the poor have good consumption patterns and protein intake
On the other hand, there is a wide gap in other health indicators
Virtually every rich family seeks modern medical treatment while only 70% of the poor do so
Moreover, almost every rich family has a private toilet, which is only owned by 16.3% of the poor
Finally, there are also a small number of poor families that still have no access to electricity
Both the rich and the poor have school age children who dropped out of school, 10.1% and 11.6% respectively
Furthermore, more rich families still have high dependency rate, although it does not seem to be a problem
Rich families are more politically active
Every adult from those families voted in the last general election, while only 92.3% of adults from poor families voted
A large gap between rich and poor can also be seen from access to information
Only 14% of poor families regularly watch television or read newspaper, compared to 100% among rich families
XII
COMPARISON OF PCA RESULTS It is imperative to note that the PCA has allowed estimation of local specific poverty indicators
Table XII.1 shows different poverty indicators in the four CBMS villages, and it is quite clear that although in general asset ownership variables are the best predictors of poverty in each village, there are quite discernible differences in the types of asset
On the other hand, non-asset ownership variables that can predict poverty in Jungpasir are the type of floor in house and ownership of private toilet
Meanwhile, in Kedondong, although in the same district as Jungpasir, sex of family head and his/her marital status are more important predictors than toilet type
There are also different significant poverty indicators in the villages in Cianjur
In Parakantugu only one non-asset variable is in the top ten: education level of family head, while in Cibulakan consumption pattern is included in the ten most important variables
Thus, we have provided evidence that there are indeed different poverty indicators between villages
More importantly, these locally specific indicators can be unearthed using the methodology we employed
XIII
LESSONS LEARNED FROM LOCAL INVOLVEMENT We recruited BKKBN cadres to be CBMS enumerators. Enumerator recruitment was
initially arranged by BKKBN district offices
Since BKKBN Cianjur is still fully operational and funded by the district government, it had no problems in identifying cadres in the village near the Cianjur capital and instructing them to attend the training
For the other village, however, there is only one BKKBN cadre
In contrast, BKKBN Demak did not have data on cadres in each village
When SMERU researchers visited the villages in Demak in the preliminary survey, they found that the two villages in Demak had never had more than two or three cadres
BKKBN data collection has always been mainly conducted by village officials with the help of PPLKB
Thus, the task of recruiting enumerators was given to village heads of the two villages, assisted by the PPLKB and PLKB.
They assigned mostly village officials as enumerators
In addition, residents with a minimum of nine years of schooling and who are socially active were also recruited to obtain the required number of enumerators
These requirements were necessary to ensure that the enumerators can fully understand the questionnaire and those recruited are people known by their neighbors
Each enumerator conducted the census in the hamlet that they reside in or a neighboring hamlet within the same neighborhood
This policy was implemented to save time and to ensure that the enumerators were already well recognized and trusted by the respondents
Furthermore, this policy also helped to minimize the number of respondents giving false information because it was more likely the enumerator would have known if a respondent gave false responses
Thus, there was at least one enumerator for each hamlet in every village 
In addition to using BKKBN cadres, SMERU researchers also assigned the PLKB and PPLKB to supervise data collection
As already known, these officials are BKKBN officials at the village and subdistrict levels and are the supervisors in the usual BKKBN data collection
Since SMERU is committed to using the BKKBN traditional data collection structure, the PLKB and PPLKB were fully involved
In addition, they collected the completed questionnaires and arranged them into each hamlet
There were several mistakes that occurred uniformly in all four villages 
(1) the enumerators sometimes failed to ask every question because they felt there was no need to ask questions whose answers they already knew; 
(2) they entered the wrong code in the questionnaire; and 
(3) some answers were inconsistent with each other. 
The first, third, and most of the second mistakes were directly rectified on the first day during the initial checks, while the rest of the coding mistakes were corrected during data cleaning in SMERU office
SMERU researchers found that enumerators' education level is quite influential in limiting mistakes during data collection, although it is not as important as their level of enthusiasm
Higher educated enumerators were less accurate than more enthusiastic enumerators with lower education
A good example is the village officials
The officials in two of the four villages were not particularly enthusiastic about conducting data collection (they agreed to do it because of the remuneration) and did not take the importance of correctly filling out the questionnaire seriously
As a result, the quality of their enumeration is relatively lower than the rest and SMERU researchers had to check their questionnaires more thoroughly
Prior data collection experience was only significant in the initial training, where experienced enumerators (cadres and village officials) understood the content of the questionnaire faster while inexperienced enumerators needed more time
Once they understood the questionnaire, however, the benefit of experience quickly dissipated
Although there is still room for improvement, we find that our questionnaire is simple enough to be administered by locals
We note that BKKBN officials at village and subdistrict levels (PLKB and PPLKB) have the potential to play a crucial role in mobilizing the locals and supervising data collection
On the other hand, village officials should not be involved in order to ensure that data is not tampered with
Moreover, we find that village officials are more prone to making mistakes in data collection
At the district level, commitment from government agencies other than BKKBN is necessary, especially in areas where BKKBN is in a comatose state

CONCLUSIONS
The purpose of this pilot project is to introduce a better poverty monitoring system to policymakers in Indonesia
Given Indonesia's size, both geographical and population, it is important that the new monitoring system is easy to administer and can be expeditiously processed to provide the stakeholders with information on poverty conditions of an area
Since poverty is very much a local phenomenon, the new system that this project introduces is sensitive to local poverty conditions and ensures that local residents play a significant role in carrying it out
Involvement of locals is important for another reason
the system can be conducted simultaneously in every village in Indonesia 
This means that there is a possibility that data collection for the whole country can be completed in less than a month
The main purpose of the project is to identify poor families in a village, hence it is very important that the methodology used is able to do so
Since recording detailed family consumption expenditure is out of the question, we employ 63 indicators as proxy for welfare
They range from asset ownership and health characteristics to political participation and access to information. 
We process these characteristics using the Principal Components Analysis method and calculate the welfare score of every family in the four villages
We find that asset ownership variables are the most significant welfare indicators, although education, health, and consumption patterns are also important
One way of testing the robustness of the welfare score is to isolate the richest and poorest families and look at their characteristics
We find in all villages that there is indeed a wide gap between those considered rich and those considered poor in almost every indicator
In conclusion, we believe that our chosen methodology is successful in enabling us to identify the poor in every village
We have also demonstrated that given enough support and supervision, locals were able to conduct their own poverty monitoring
By introducing CBMS, we hope that interested stakeholders will know that there exists a poverty monitoring system that is relatively accurate, involves the locals, is specific to local characteristics while remaining objective, and is feasible to be undertaken by the district governments, which can help them in their efforts to more effectively increase the welfare of their people
ABSTRACT Targeting has been a recurring problem in implementing a program
The SMERU Research Institute has developed a data collection system based on the local community and the analysis is conducted objectively by utilizing the Principal Component Analysis method
The data collection system is known as the Community Based Monitoring System (CBMS)
The system is acknowledged to have high accuracy and in fact, in the Philippines, it has been made a national policy
In Indonesia, the utilization of the system has been tried out in four villages in West Java and Central Java
The results of the CBMS tryout could identify the families in the villages based on the family welfare ranking, starting from the most prosperous family to the least prosperous or the poorest
To test the accuracy of the results of the CBMS pilot test in Indonesia, SMERU conducted a verification utilizing the focused group discussion (FGD) method in two of the four tested CBMS villages
The verification results show that CBMS calculation results have quite high accuracy
CBMS is able to correctly rank the RW and hamlets based on the family welfare in each of the respective area
The accuracy of the results will sharpen the area targeting in conducting a program
Furthermore, CBMS is also able to predict the ranking of family welfare with quite high accuracy, so that in the end it is expected that subjectivity in the targeting of a program can be minimized
I
INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background Many poverty reduction programs and projects have been conducted by the government, both central and local, and by private institutions
Over the years, a factor that has been a problem in implementing a program or a project is the identification of targets and the accuracy of the targeting
Therefore, it is not surprising that mistargeting is still found in the monitoring and evaluation activities conducted by a number of institutions
For example, the research conducted by the GTP-JPS Control Team (2000) on the Social Safety Net (JPS) for the Educational Sector finds that “the allocation for each district/municipality (kabupaten/kota) from the central administration is not supported with accurate statistical data and so it is likely that the targeting of the scholarship recipients is inaccurate” (21)
When monitoring the JPS for the Health Sector, the team also concludes that
the data from the BKKBN as the foundation to determine the target group cannot always be applied in every region, and thus, some mistargetings have occurred
This is because of the data that uses “owning a house that is only dirtfloored” as one indicator to determine pre-prosperous families, while actually, the family interviewed owns cows, goats, and a satellite dish
Therefore, cannot be categorized as pre-prosperous
However, based on the criteria determined by BKKBN, this family belongs to the pre-prosperous family group, hence they are provided with health facilities
This happened in Surabaya, East Java, and Simalungun, North Sumatra (GTP-JPS Control Team 2000 22)
The study conducted by Hastuti & Maxwell (2003) on Raskin (Rice for the Poor) Program finds that in one village group, all efforts to conduct the targeting on particular families had been abandoned, and Raskin rice was given in a relatively equal amount to all families in the village based on a “first come, first served” basis
This kind of targeting inaccuracy should be avoided, at least minimized, when conducting similar programs in the future
In 2005, the SMERU Research Institute, in cooperation with BKKBN, conducted a pilot test on the implementation of the Community Based Monitoring System (CBMS) in two districts, Kabupaten Cianjur in West Java and Kabupaten Demak in Central Java
The system was aimed to objectively identify the welfare of a family in a region, so that if it is applied for a program or a project, it can reduce the targeting inaccuracy
In this system, data collection is done by the local community, and the data processing and its analysis are conducted by SMERU, utilizing the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method
The estimation results of the determination of the ranking of family welfare in a region that utilizes the PCA method need to be tested to see their accuracy by conducting field verification
Cibulakan Village in Cianjur and Kedondong Village in Demak are the CBMS test villages selected as the locations to conduct Focused Group Discussions (FGDs) in this CBMS verification activity
1.2 Methodology The CBMS verification is conducted by seeing how CBMS results match with the community evaluation
The CBMS results are taken from the data collected by the village community, the processing and analyzing of which utilize the PCA method, while the community evaluation towards the family welfare in the village is obtained through FGDs
The FGDs with the village community are done in two levels, the village level FGD and the RT level FGD
The village level FGD is conducted to gather information about the classifications of family welfare, along with its indicators and characteristics at the village level, and the ranking of inter-RW and inter-hamlet family welfares
FGD at the village level is attended by community figures, village religious figures, representatives of each RW, and local people with various professions who know much about the family welfare in the village, such as midwives and teachers who live in the respective villages, as well as village officials
Meanwhile, the FGD at the RT level is conducted in two RT of each village
The selection of the RT uses the following criteria
(1) one RT should be far from the economic center or the village administration, while the other should be close to it; 
(2) one RT should have between 100 and 200 families and the other should have between 50 and 100 families; 
(3) both RT should have families with quite diverse or heterogenic socioeconomic ranking so that the FGD participants can differenciate and rank the inter-family welfare
The FGD participants at the RT level are the residents of the RT, consisting of community figures, religious leaders, youth leaders, RT officials, and people with various professions who may know a lot about the family welfare in their respective RT, such as teachers, traders, motorcycle taxi (ojek) drivers, and housewives, so that the family welfare in the RT can be classified and ranked well
CBMS verification is conducted in four stages
In the first stage, the FGD participants estimate the proportion of family welfare at the village level
The estimation results are also used as the foundation for calculating the proportion of family welfare at each RW based on the CBMS calculation
In the second stage, the FGD participants estimate the proportion of the family welfare at each RW, the result of which are compared with the family welfare proportion of each RW based on the CBMS calculation
In the third stage, the FGD participants rank the inter-RW and inter-hamlet welfares, which are then compared with the inter-RW and inter-hamlet welfares based on the CBMS calculation
In the fourth stage, the classification and/or ranking results of the family welfare of the chosen RT are compared with the ranking results of the family welfare based on the CBMS calculation in the respective RT
The FGDs were conducted in July 2006 in Cibulakan Village (Cianjur) and in September 2006 in Kedondong Village (Demak)
These FGDs were conducted by four SMERU researchers
II
GENERAL DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FGD LOCATIONS The two villages selected as the place for the FGDs to verify the CBMS were Cibulakan Village in Kabupaten Cianjur and Kedondong Village in Kabupaten Demak
In Cibulakan Village, RT 1 RW 2 and RT 1 RW 6 were chosen
RT 1 RW 2 represented the area that is close to the economic center and has many families, and RT 1 RW 6 represented the area that is far from the economic center and has few families
In Kedondong Village, RT 4 RW 1 and RT 6 RW 3 were chosen
RT 4 RW 1 represented the area that is close to the village administration or economic center and has a small number of families, while RT 6 RW 3 represented the area that is far from the center of the economic activities and administration and has many families
2.1 The Cibulakan Village Cibulakan Village is one of the 16 villages in Kecamatan Cugenang of Kabupaten Cianjur
Administratively, this village comprises of three hamlets, six RW, and 22 RT
Each hamlet comprises of two RW
Hamlet 1 (Panumbangan) comprises of RW 1 and RW 2
Hamlet 2 (Garogol) comprises of RW 3 and RW 4, and Hamlet 3 (Ranca Picung) comprises of RW 5 and RW 6
RW 1 through RW 5 are located along the village main road while RW 6 is two kilometers far inwards the main road and is surrounded by paddy fields
Cibulakan Village is located about 6 km from the capital of Kabupaten Cianjur and four kilometers from the capital of Kecamatan Cugenang
Even though it is not close to the intercity roads, the village can be reached from two main roads, the Cianjur-Jakarta Road and the Cianjur-Sukabumi Road
These two roads can be reached within a 20-minute drive from Cibulakan Village
Meanwhile, the roads that connect Cibulakan Village and the two main roads are asphalted and relatively well-maintained, although they are quite narrow
The roads have made it possible for minibus public transportation to serve intervillage routes through the main roads of Cibulakan Village
This condition has helped the village residents in conducting their daily activities
Another public transportation in this village is the motorcycle taxi (ojek) that serves shortdistance transportation
This ojek service is especially used by the people of RW 5 and RW 6 who are not served by the minibuses because these RW are not located along the village main road and the road of the RW is narrow
Besides, only motorcycle is able to pass the road to RW 6 during the rainy season
According to the latest data from BPS, the size of Cibulakan Village is 200 hectares, the largest part of which, 138.3 hectares, is used to cultivate paddy throughout the year
Meanwhile, the part of the area that is used for residential area is 34.5 hectares in size
The rest is used for fishponds and public facilities
Most of the residents work as farmers
Some of them have their own paddy field, although they do not necessarily work on it themselves, some of them work on their own paddy field, and some others are farm hands because they do not have their own paddy field
Most farmers plant paddy, while only a few plant vegetables or farm fish
Besides working as farmers, other occupations of the residents in Cibulakan Village are traders, workers of private companies, civil servants, and drivers of village public transport or motorcycle taxi
There are many residents who work as TKI (Indonesian workers working in foreign countries), working mostly in the Middle East Countries
The families of the TKIs are generally more prosperous than other families
Generally, the people in Cibulakan Village still use pumps and the spring as their main sources of drinking water, even though PDAM has provided its service in this place
This means that most houses have had access to piped water, especially those living by the village main road, while the residents who do not have access to PDAM can get it from PDAM watertaps in the local mosque for free
For source of light, almost all houses have access to electric lighting, even though there are some residents who still use petromaks (oil-based) lamps
Many residents already have separate bathrooms and toilets
Most houses have a bathroom, though only consisting of a bathtub which also functions as fishponds, and a private toilet facility
Only a few families still use public toilets and even fewer still use the river for bathing, washing, and as lavatory
Meanwhile, the educational facilities in the village are limited
There are four public primary schools and one private junior secondary school
Nevertheless, other schools are relatively close
There is a public junior secondary school in a neighboring subdistrict and a senior secondary school and a college in the capital city of Cianjur
Moreover, locally managed Islamic schools are also available in the village
There are no health facilities in the village
The only facility that once existed is no longer in use
Nevertheless, there are two nurses who hold a private practice in their houses and there is also a midwife and a traditional midwife
Telecommunication facilities are generally available in the village
Permanent telephone access is available from the state telecommunication company (PT Telkom), even though the number of customers is very small
There is also a wartel (telecommunication kiosk) available for the residents
In the last few years, cellular phones have been very popular among the residents of Cibulakan Village
This is supported by several factors, among others, the decreasing price of cellular handsets, strong cellular signal, and the decreasing airtime tariffs
Other larger infrastructures, like markets, post offices, police stations, and banks, are not yet available in the village
The residents have to go to the capital of Kabupaten Cianjur for these services
For credit purposes, the residents usually go to the bank located outside the village, to pawnshops, or to the micro financial unit of the Kecamatan Development Program (KDP)
2.2 RT 1 RW 2 of Cibulakan Village RT 1 RW 2 is an area in Hamlet 1 (Panumbangan)
Part of the area of RT 1 faces the village main road, so the RT 1 RW 2 residents have easy access to the main road and have relatively high mobility
The location of RT 1 RW 2 is close to the center of the village economic activities; this makes the area of high density
Other than the houses that face the village main road, other houses can be accessed through a winding narrow road
Since the residential area is not well planned, the houses are not arranged in an orderly manner
Generally, the landparcels are narrow and some of the residents' houses are multistoried
The number of residents in RT 1 RW 2 has increased quite significantly since 2005
When the CBMS data collection was conducted in 2005, there had been 102 families, and when the verification was conducted in 2006, the number of families had increased to 112 families
The occupation of the residents in RT 1 RW 2 is generally farming, while others work in civil service, private employment, trading, and religious-related activities
2.3 RT 1 RW 6 of Cibulakan Village RT 1 RW 6 is located around 2 km from the village main road, hence far from the center of the village economic activities
Nevertheless, RT 1 is more scenic because it is surrounded by paddy fields and is geographically at a higher elevation than the other RT in the village
Meanwhile, the relatively small number of residents compared with that of the other RT in the village results in more spacious houses
The road to this RT can be passed by cars
However, the main means of transportation for the residents from and to the village center is motorcycle, both private and public, or the residents can travel on foot
The nuance of village life is most apparent in RT 1 RW 6
Its distance from the center of activities, its small area, and its small number of residents, as well as its many open spaces, make every activity in the RT known to most of the residents
The number of the residents in RT 1 RW 6 has not changed much in the past one year
One of the causes for the small number of families is its distant location from the center of the village economic activities
the migration of the RT residents, both immigration and emigration, is relatively rare
Finally, most of the residents work as farmers
2.4 Kedondong Village Administratively, Kedondong Village is one of the 19 villages existing in Kecamatan Demak
It comprises of three RW and 20 RT
To get to Kedondong Village, which is around 10 km from the capital city of Demak, people can either take minibus public transportation or the Demak-Kudus/Pati intercity bus to the village border and then continue by taking ojek or walking
The educational facilities in the village only consist of four primary schools and one kindergarten
There are no secondary schools in the village
The closest junior secondary school is 3 km away, while the closest senior secondary school is 5 km away

In terms of sanitation, most residents make use of the river running on the west part of the village to bathe
A resident told the SMERU researchers that only very wealthy people own a bathroom, while most families, including those who can afford to build one, prefer to use the river because they can socially interact with the neighbors when bathing
In contrast, most of the residents consume drinking water from the PDAM
For the source of energy, most residents use firewood to cook; kerosene and gas stoves come next
Moreover, every house has an electricity connection from the state electricity company (PLN), and although there are some houses that do not get direct electricity connection, they obtain it from other houses

2.5 RT 4 RW 1 of Kedondong Village RT 4 RW 1 is one of the seven RT in RW 1 in Kedondong Village
The number of families in RT 4 increased from 51 families in 2005 (during the CBMS data collection) to 67 families in 2006 (during the verification)
The change in the number of families is due to, among others, families moving out of the village and the new families as the result of marriages
RT 4 is located in a flat rectangular area, with 165 meters in length and 45 meters in width
Most residents' houses face the village main road; some are in the inner part of the village and can be accessed through the alleys between houses
In the west, RT 4 is separated from RT 2 RW 1 and RT 5 RW 1 by the village road; in the east, it is separated from RT 4 RW 2 by the village road; in the south, it is separated from RT 7 RW 1 and RT 5 RW 2 by the village road; and in the north, it is separated from RT 3 RW 1 by the village road
The village road surrounding the area of RT 4 is a makadam road and it gets dusty when vehicles pass through in the dry season
RT 4 RW 1 is located not far from the village office and mosque
In fact, the village head lives in this RT
The residents' occupations in this RT are mostly farmers
other occupations include village officials, traders, or other occupations in the service sector such as public transportation drivers
The community's access to education for primary school level is easy since there is a primary school in the village and it is not far from RT 4
However, if the primary school students are to continue to a higher level, they have to go to schools located outside the village
2.6 RT 6 RW 3 of Kedondong Village RT 6 RW 3 is one of the six RT in RW 3 of Kedondong Village

The community's access to basic education (primary school level) is very easy due to the existence of two public primary schools which are located between RT 6 and RT 5 of RW 3
However, just like the other community members in Kedondong Village, primary school students in RT 6 RW 3 who wish to continue their study to a higher level must seek the education outside of the village
The occupation of the residents of RT 6 RW 3 is generally farming, with most choosing onion farming
Other than becoming farmers, some residents work as village officials, teachers, religious teachers, or traders
In addition, there are six families opening stalls that sell basic necessities at their houses

WELFARE CONDITIONS AT THE VILLAGE AND RT LEVELS ACCORDING TO FGD RESULTS 3.1 Family Welfare Indicators in Cibulakan Village The FGD at the village level was followed by 16 people, consisting of nine men and seven women
The FGD participants at the village level were the residents and the village officials who knew the family welfare condition in Cibulakan Village
They are midwives, teachers, religious leaders, public figures, several managers of the Village Representative Board (BPD), and village officials
In the FGD at village level in Cibulakan Village, the participants agreed upon four classifications of family welfare

The income of a poor family is between Rp500 thousand-Rp1 million/month, and the income of a very poor family is less than Rp500 thousand/month
Income is not the only measurement to classify the family welfare
An FGD participant argued that although a motorcycle taxi driver could get Rp50,000 in one day, he still could not be classified into the middle class family because his daily income is fluctuating
The second indicator, employment, is still related to the first indicator (income)
Rich family in Cibulakan Village generally has both steady jobs (with steady income) and side jobs (with side income)
Among them are those who are permanent employees, are running an enterprise, or even own a factory or a rice mill
Middle class family generally has one steady income source, such as from being a civil servant, while the head of a poor family generally works as farm hands or construction workers, public transport drivers, and sometimes street vendors
The head of a family classified as a very poor family generally does not have a steady job, and sometimes works as a laborer, paddy field coolie, or seasonal laborer

The rich families generally live in permanent houses with brick walls and ceramic tiles covering the floor, and some of the houses are even multistoried, having private toilet and bathroom facilities
They own the house, the size of which is around 100 square meters
Meanwhile, the middle class families live in a permanent, albeit not luxurious, house with ceramic tiles covering the floor; there is also a private toilet facility in their house
the size of which is around 24 square meters (6 m × 4 m)
In contrast, the poor families' houses are generally semi permanent, are raised on a platform, are made of boards or bamboo (stilt houses) 
Have no private toilet facility, they use the public toilet facility
Finally, the very poor families do not have any house, so they live in a rented house or with their parents

The last two family classifications generally have a letter called the SKTM, which is issued by the village administration and states the families' financial incapacity, to make them eligible for free medical help
Seen from the food consumption pattern indicator, the rich families generally eat three times a day with different menus, and they could choose between fish and chicken
The middle class families eat twice to thrice a day, eating chicken once a week at the most

3.4 Family Welfare Indicators in Kedondong Village The FGD in Kedondong Village was attended by eleven men and five women
teachers, religious teachers, RW officials, village officials, BPD members, midwives, and women's group cadres
From the FGD results at the village level, there are three classifications of family welfare
(1) rich or sugih, (2) middle class (moderate) or sedheng, and (3) poor
These classifications are based on seven indicators of family welfare
housing conditions, asset ownership, ability to put children to school, employment (work), income, health, and food consumption pattern
Seen from the housing condition indicator, generally, the rich families own a big house (6m × 8m) with brick walls, ceramic-tiled floor, “Mantili” roof tile, a private bathroom inside, and a 900-watt electric capacity
The middle class families own a simple house with plastered or black-tiled floor, a bathroom outside, and have a 450-watt electric capacity
Among the poor families, some own a house
others live in other people's houses
For those owning a house, it is usually made of bamboo (gedhek) and has dirt floor

The moderate families own a motorcycle, a pick-up used for business, a kerosene stove (rarely does one have a gas stove), little jewelry, and less than one hectare of paddy field, 
In contrast, the poor families own a bicycle (onthel), own no television but a radio, have only earrings for jewelry, and have no paddy field
From the education indicator, it is actually not the education of the head of the family of the rich, moderate, and poor families that can be used to classify, but the education level of the children
In the rich families, the children usually have a higher education than those in the moderate or poor families, such as tertiary level of education
In the moderate family group, the education of the children ranges from primary school to college
Among the poor families, the children only study until primary school, though some study to junior secondary school

3.5 Family Welfare Indicators in RT 4 RW 1 Kedondong Village The FGD in RT 4 RW 1 Kedondong Village was attended by ten men and six women
It was followed by the local people and the RT officials who know the family welfare conditions in RT 4 RW 1
The participants' occupations are midwives, village officials, religious teachers, RT officials, officials/members of the women's group (PKK), village cadres, and housewives
From the FGD results in RT 4 RW 1, there are three classifications of family welfare

Seen from the employment indicator, the FGD participants identified that the rich families are grocery store owners, farmers working on their own paddy field, traders, village officials, and drivers of their own pick-ups
The moderate families generally work as farmers or small traders selling things around
The poor families, in comparison, generally work as farm hands, animal farmers (maro kebo), trash collectors, construction laborers, factory workers, and fish sellers, while some others are even unemployed
Seen from the food consumption pattern indicator, the rich families generally eat three times a day with rice from their own field, with fish or meat twice a week, and also with tofu and tempeh
The moderate families also eat three times a day with rice from their own field, eat fish, vegetables, tofu and tempeh, and eat meat once a month
In contrast, though the poor families eat three times a day, they do not consume rice from their own field
They eat salted fish, tempeh, and garlic chili sauce
They eat meat once a year, given to them on Eid al- Adha

Seen from the health indicator, the rich families generally see specialists, go to the puskesmas or hospitals, or see midwives
The moderate families, meanwhile, get medical treatment from the village midwives or in puskesmas and if their sickness is serious, they seek medical treatment at the hospital
In contrast, the poor families generally go to traditional healers or the puskesmas
It appears that all groups of families go to puskesmas for treatment, both the rich and the moderate, as well as the poor
3.6 Family Welfare Indicators in RT 6 RW 3 Kedondong Village Six men and five women participated in the FGD in this RT
They are local community members and RT officials who know the family welfare conditions in RT 6 RW 3
Their occupations are kindergarten teachers, religious teachers, RT officials, BPD members, PKK members, village officials, and housewives
From the FGD results there are three family welfare classifications in RT 6 RW 3
(1) wellto-do, (2) moderate, and (3) poor
The three family welfare classifications are based on the seven family welfare indicators
asset ownership, housing conditions, health, education, employment (work), income or savings, and food consumption pattern
According to the FGD participants, most of the poor family heads are widows
In terms of asset ownership, the well-to-do families in RT 6 generally have fine furniture, like cupboards, 21-inch televisions, plate shelves made of aluminum, a rice cooker, a fan, and one up to two motorcycles, which were paid in cash
Additionally, the well-to-do families cook with gas stoves
The moderate families, on the contrary, generally have fewer assets than the well-to-do families do in terms of quantity, quality, and size
The shelves for plates are made of bamboo
Because they do not have any vehicles, the poor families mostly travel on foot
Finally, they use firewood from their farms for the cooking fuel
Examined from the housing condition, the well-to-do families generally own luxurious houses with brick walls, ceramic-tiled floor, and ceramic-tiled bathrooms
Generally, the well-to-do families' house is 64 square meters wide
In comparison, the moderate families generally own a simple house with wooden walls, plastered or black-tiled floor, and the house's size is around 54 square meters
In contrast, only some of the poor families own a house
Among those owning a house, the house is generally not in a good condition, with walls made of bamboo (gedhek), dirt floor, and the size is 48 square meters (6m by 8m)
Seen from the health indicator, generally the well-to-do families go to hospitals, puskesmas, midwives (often), and doctors (rarely)
The moderate families generally go to midwives, puskesmas, and hospitals
The poor families, on the contrary, go to the puskesmas or traditional healers
It appears that going to the puskesmas to seek medical treatment is the one common ground among all the family groups
This is caused by the fact that there is a regional regulation which makes it possible for the community to get free medical treatment in any puskesmas in Kabupaten Demak
Seen from the education indicator, children from the well-to-do families generally study up to junior secondary school or senior secondary school at the most, while children from the moderate families study up to junior secondary school at the most
Among the poor families, the children only finish primary school
Seen from the employment indicator, the well-to-do families are identified as farmers and traders
Farmers belonging to this group at least own between half of a bahu and one hectare of paddy fields, while the traders usually sell fish or basic necessities at their own stalls
The moderate families generally work as farmers, construction coolies (rock or wood), drivers (driving a car owned by someone else), or teachers
Farmers in the moderate family group are usually farmers who rent fields once a year, with the cost of rent between Rp3-4 million a year for a paddy field of one bahu, or those who have a quarter of bahu of paddy field
The poor families usually do many different casual jobs, such as becoming farm hands and trash collectors, or even unemployed at times
As for the income and savings indicators, it was difficult for the FGD participants to identify the well-to-do families' income, although they can estimate that the annual savings of these families are between Rp4-8 million
The moderate families' income is around Rp350 thousand per month or they can set aside an amount of Rp1.5-4 million for annual savings
In contrast, the poor families sometime have no income; if they do, it is no more than Rp100 thousand per month (gross)
The poor families who have no income usually pay the goods they get from the village stalls on credit to fulfill the basic needs
Seen from the daily food consumption pattern, the well-to-do families can eat three times a day with chicken or beef at least once a month
The moderate families also eat three times a day, albeit with no chicken or beef
In contrast, the poor only eats twice a day and the food is inexpensive; sometimes salted fish or kangkung (water cress)
IV
FAMILY WELFARE PROPORTION AND RANKING ACCORDING TO FGD RESULTS The ranking of family welfare was designed both at the FGD at village and RT levels
In the FGD at village level, the determination of the ranking of family welfare began with the classification of the family welfare at the village level, followed by the estimation of the proportion of each welfare class at the village level and in each RW
Afterwards, the ranking of RT and/or hamlet based on their welfare was created
In the FGD at RT level, meanwhile, determination of the ranking of family welfare started with designing the classifications of family welfare, the indicators, and characteristics existing in every RT
These were then followed by categorizing the families into the family welfare classifications, and, if possible, the ranking of each family in the RT based on its welfare compared to other families
4.1 The Proportion of Family Welfare Classifications at RW Level Cibulakan Village 
At the village level, the process of the FGD in Cibulakan Village was undertaken as described above
The classifications, indicators and characteristics of family welfare in Cibulakan Village have been explained in Chapter 3
The estimation of the proportion of the family welfare classifications was conducted gradually from the village level to each RW in Cibulakan Village
It was carried out by the FGD participants by using a ‘handful of clothes buttons' distributed to every welfare class at village level
The distributed buttons were then counted and the result was discussed with the FGD participants until they reached an agreement
At village level, the proportion of the family welfare classifications is as follows
10% of the families in Cibulakan Village are categorized as rich; 30% are middle class; 35% are poor; and 25% are very poor (see Table 4.1)
In essence, this is the community poverty line
The proportion is then used by the CBMS to calculate the share of each class at the RW level
This is done because CBMS results are in the form of a ranking of the poorest to the richest families (or vice-versa) in Cibulakan Village
The process of estimating the proportion of family welfare classifications at the village level was then followed by estimating the proportion of family welfare classifications in every RW in Cibulakan village
The village level FGD participants coming from a particular RW estimated the proportion of family welfare classifications of their own RW and so did the other participants coming from other RW
The estimation results were discussed with the other FGD participants until they reached the estimation of the proportion of family welfare classifications in every RW as presented in Table 4.1
The table shows that the percentage of the rich group in every RW is at the most 6% (in RW 2), which is far below that of the village level (10%)
The percentage of middle class group in every RW is similar to that of the village level
On the contrary, the table shows that on average the percentage of the poor group in every RW shows higher proportion than that of the village level
While this is quantitatively impossible, the participants defended the results
Kedondong Village The FGD in Kedondong village was conducted in the same way as it was in Cibulakan Village
The proportion of family welfare classifications at village level and in each RW was also estimated
The classifications, indicators, and the characteristics of the family welfare in Kedondong Village have been described earlier in Chapter 3
As to the estimation of the proportion of family welfare classifications, it was conducted gradually from the village level to each RW in Kedondong Village
The process of estimating the proportion of family welfare classifications was exactly the same as the one conducted in Cibulakan Village
At village level, the proportion of family welfare classifications is as follows
15% of the families in Kedondong Village are categorized as rich; 50% are middle class; and 35% are poor (see Table 4.2)
The process of estimating the proportion of family welfare classifications at village level was followed by estimating the proportion of family welfare classifications in every RW
The FGD participants coming from a certain RW estimated the proportion of family welfare classifications in their own RW, and so did the other participants from other RW
The estimation results were discussed with the other FGD participants until they reached the estimation of the proportion of family welfare classifications in every RW as presented in Table 4.2
The table shows that the biggest share of the rich group in every RW is 15%, which is exactly the same as that of the village level
FGD estimated that only 9% of the families in RW 2 are rich, 33% are middle class, and 58% are poor
The proportion of family welfare classifications in RW 3 is as follows
12% are rich, 48% are middle class and 40% are poor
4.2 The Ranking of Inter-RW Family Welfare Cibulakan Village
Based on the knowledge gained when designing the classifications and the indicators, as well as the characteristics of family welfare, the FGD participants ranked the inter-RW family welfare in Cibulakan Village
The results show that RW 2 is the most prosperous in Cibulakan Village, followed by RW 3, RW 1, RW 4, RW 6, and RW 5 (see Table 4.3)
The FGD participants thought that RW 2 was more prosperous than RW 3 because many families in RW 2 have cars and paddy fields, while the families in RW 3 in general only have the fields
Kedondong Village The FGD participants in Kedondong also ranked the inter-RW family welfare
The results show that RW 1 is the richest in Kedondong Village, followed by RW 3 and then RW 2 (see Table 4.4)
The FGD participants thought that RW 1 was more prosperous than the other RW because many families in RW 1 are high-ranking government officials, have cars, pay considerable house and land taxes
Meanwhile, RW 3 is in the second rank because its residents have fairly low education, and there is no significant number of high-ranking officials in the RW
RW 2 is in the lowest rank because the people have lower level of education than the people in the other RW and their houses are not in good condition as those in the other RW
4.3 The Ranking of Inter-hamlet Family Welfare 
The ranking of inter-hamlet family welfare was only conducted in Cibulakan Village that comprises of three hamlets
This ranking was not conducted in Kedondong Village (Demak) because administratively this village is not divided into hamlets, but into a number of RW
The ranking of inter-hamlet family welfare in Cibulakan Village was conducted after the FGD participants finished ranking the inter-RW family welfare
As described earlier in Chapter 2, the Cibulakan Village comprises of three hamlets, namely Hamlet 1 (Dusun Panumbangan), Hamlet 2 (Dusun Garogol), and Hamlet 3 (Dusun Ranca Picung)
Hamlet 1 consists of RW 1 and RW 2; Hamlet 2 consists of RW 3 and RW 4; and Hamlet 3 consists of RW 5 and RW 6
Based on a plain observation and their knowledge, the village level FGD participants agreed that Hamlet 1 is the most prosperous village seen from the ranking of family welfare, followed by Hamlet 2; and the least prosperous one is Hamlet 3 (see Table 4.5)
4.4 The Ranking of Family Welfare in RT 1 RW 2 of Cibulakan Village 
The FGD activities in RT 1 RW 2 were conducted to gather information about the family welfare classifications in the RT, the indicators, and the characteristics of each family welfare classification
Moreover, it was conducted to estimate the proportion of the family welfare classifications, as well as to rank the family welfare in the RT
The classifications, indicators, and characteristics of family welfare in the RT have been explained earlier
As to the estimation of the proportion of family welfare conducted by the FGD participants in RT 1 RW 2 using the buttons, it shows that 10% of the families in the RT are categorized as rich, 14% middle class, 46% poor, and 30% very poor
In identifying the number of family in RT 1 RW 2, the FGD participants found that there are 112 families presently living in the RT
The 112 families were then individually listed and grouped into family welfare classifications
The results show that 14 families or 12.5% are categorized as rich, 46 families (41%) middle class, 47 families (42%) poor, and five families (4.5%) very poor
These results were then confirmed with the participants as they were different from their estimation of family welfare proportion made earlier using the buttons
The participants believed that the percentage of the identification results were more accurate than that of the estimation of the family welfare proportion
They thought that the results of the identification were closer to the reality because every family in the RT was identified one by one
Of the identified families (rich, middle class, poor and very poor), the FGD participants could only rank the very poor family group (five families), while the poor family group (47 families), middle class family group (46 families) and rich family group (14 families) could not be ranked
The approach the FGD participants used to rank the family welfare of the poor family group was by grouping them into two sub-groups, "upper-poor" and "lower-poor"
4.5 The Ranking of Family Welfare in RT 1 RW 6 of Cibulakan Village 
The estimation of the proportion of family welfare conducted by the FGD participants in RT 1 RW 6 using the buttons shows that 4% of the families in that RT are categorized as rich, 11% middle class, 38% poor, and 47% very poor
In identifying the number of families in RT 1 RW 6, the FGD participants found that there are 60 families presently living in the RT
Each of the 60 families were then grouped into family welfare classifications and the results showed that four families (7%) were categorized as rich, 14 families (23%) as middle class, 26 families (43%) as poor, and 16 families (27%) as very poor
The results or these percentages were then confirmed with the participants because they were different from the FGD participants' estimation made earlier
Again, the participants believed that the percentage of the identification results were more accurate than that of the estimation of the family welfare proportion
Of the families that had been identified into four family welfare groups (rich, middle class, poor, and very poor), the FGD participants could rank the family welfare of every family welfare group
4.6 The Ranking of Family Welfare in RT 4 RW 1 of Kedondong Village 
The estimation of proportion of family welfare conducted by the FGD participants in RT 4 RW 1 shows that 5% of the families in that RT are categorized as rich, 35% middle class and 60% poor
In naming each family in RT 4 RW 1, the FGD participants found that there are 67 families presently living in that RT
The 67 families were then individually grouped into family welfare classifications and the results showed that four families (6%) were categorized as rich, 18 families (27%) middle class, and 45 families (67%) poor
The results of these percentages were then confirmed with the participants because they were different from the FGD participants' estimation made earlier
Similar to the two earlier FGDs, the participants believed that the percentage of the identification results were more accurate than that of the estimation of the family welfare proportion
Of the families that had been identified into three family welfare groups (rich, middle class, and poor), the FGD participants could rank the family welfare of every family welfare group
Therefore, the 67 families in RT 4 RW 1 could be ranked from the most prosperous to the poorest
4.7 The Ranking of Family Welfare in RT 6 RW 3 of Kedondong Village 
Finally, FGD participants in RT 6 RW 3 stated that 12% of the families in that RT are rich, 60% are middle class, and 28% are poor
When individually identifying and grouping the families, the FGD participants found that there are 122 families in that RT
The families were then grouped into family welfare classifications and the results showed that 17 families (14%) were categorized as rich, 56 families (46%) middle class, and 49 families (40%) poor
Similar to what happened in the other three FGDs, the FGD participants in this RT believed that the percentage of the identification results were more accurate than the estimated results
Of the families that had been identified into three family welfare groups (rich, middle class, and poor), the FGD participants could not rank the family welfare of every family welfare group
V
THE COMPARISON OF THE FGD AND CBMS RESULTS The CBMS results are verified by comparing between the results of CBMS and those of the FGDs
The CBMS verification includes the inter-RW family welfare proportion, the ranking of inter-RW family welfare, the ranking of inter-hamlet family welfare (only in Cibulakan Village), and the ranking of family welfare in RT 1 RW 2 and RT 1 RW 6 of Cibulakan Village and in RT 4 RW 1 and RT 6 RW 3 of Kedondong Village
5.1 Inter-RW Family Welfare Proportion 
In Cibulakan Village, in general there seems to be differences between the proportion of family welfare in all RW resulting from the CBMS and that of the FGD participants' estimations
Of the 24 percentage rates compared, there is not even one that is the same
The percentage point differences are between one percentage point and 23 percentage points
However, both have the same distribution
This can be seen in Table 5.1
According to the FGD participants' estimation in RW 1, 5% of the families belong to the rich group, 48% the middle class, 37% the poor, and 10% the very poor
Meanwhile, according to CBMS, there are 14% rich families, 40% middle class families, 30% poor families, and 16% very poor families in RW 1
This shows that although the percentage rates of the proportion of family welfare classifications based on the FGD participants' estimations and the CBMS are different, both have the same distribution patterns
This applies to the other RW as well
Meanwhile, there are also disparities between the CBMS and FGD results in terms of welfare at the RW level
There is only one that is the same as that of the CBMS
The difference ranges from two percentage points to 19 percentage points
Similar to Cibulakan, however, both percentage rates have the same distribution patterns, as shown in Table 5.2
This also applies to RW 2 and RW 3
The Proportion of Family Welfare in Every RW in Cibulakan Village As explained above, the percentage rate or the proportion of family welfare classifications in every RW according to FGDs is different from that of CBMS
The details will be explained below
In RW 1, the FGD participants' estimation on the proportion of family welfare classifications showed that the rich group is 5% of the population, the middle class 48%, the poor 37%, and the very poor 10%
These rates are different from those of CBMS' that shows 14% rich families, 40% middle class families, 30% poor families, and 16% very poor families (see Figure 5.1)
The FGD participants tend to put the families into the “middle group” that is the middle class and the poor
While the two extremes, the rich and the very poor, tend to be slightly lower than that of CBMS'
The distribution pattern in RW 2, meanwhile, is different from that in RW 1
Even though the results of FGD and those of CBMS have the same distribution patterns, the result of estimation of family welfare in RW 2 appears to be less, in which the number of the upper group (the rich and the middle class) according to the FGD participants is lower than the number calculated based on the CBMS
Furthermore, the estimation result of the lower groups (the poor and the very poor) based on the FGD shows higher percentage rate than that of CBMS (see Figure 5.2)
According to the FGD participants this is due to the fuel price hike in October 2005, resulting in the drop of the community's welfare
In the meantime, the FGD estimation on the proportion of family welfare in RW 3 tends to be the same as that of the CBMS
However, the distribution pattern is somewhat different
The proportion of the rich based on the CBMS is larger than that of the FGD estimation; however, the proportion of the middle class based on the FGD estimation is bigger than that of the CBMS
Lastly, the welfare proportion of the poor based on the CBMS is bigger than that of the FGD estimation
In RW 4, the proportion of the family welfare has a similarity with that of RW 2
This is shown by the fact that Figure 5.4 and Figure 5.3 have the same pattern
In RW 5, the proportion of the family welfare has a different pattern from that of the other RW
Here, the proportion of family welfare based on the FGD participants' estimation is higher than that of the CBMS, and only the proportion of the very poor group based on the FGD estimation is lower than that based on the CBMS
This shows that the FGD participants believe that families in RW 5 are more prosperous than what the CBMS found
An argument supporting this is that the residents in RW 5 living slightly far from the village economic center can cater for their own basic needs
For instance, they can get vegetables and fruits from their own gardens
As described earlier, RW 5 and RW 6 are located separately from the other RW
In RW 6, the proportions of the family welfare, both based on the FGD and CBMS, have the same distribution patterns (see Figure 5.6)
The proportion of the rich, middle class, and poor based on the FGD is higher than that of the CBMS, and only the percentage rate of the very poor is lower than that of the CBMS
This means that the FGD participants believe that the residents of RW 6 are more prosperous than what the CBMS found
The argument supporting this is that according the village level FGD participants the average income of the rich group is at least Rp2 million per month; while based on FGD in RT 1 RW 6, it is stated that the residents with average income of at least Rp1 million are categorized into the rich group
This means that a person considered as rich in this RW is actually not as rich when compared to other RW in the village
The Proportion of Family Welfare in Every RW in Kedondong Village In RW 1 in Kedondong Village, the proportion of the rich based on FGD results is two percentage points higher than that based on CBMS
On the contrary, the proportion of the middle class families based on the FGD results is two percentage points lower than that based on the CBMS
This slight difference shows that the CBMS results generally agree with those of the FGD
The proportion of the poor, in addition, is the same from both FGD and CBMS results
In RW 2 and RW 3, meanwhile, the proportions of the rich and the middle class families according to FGD are higher than the CBMS finding, and vice versa for the poor
In RW 2, the difference between the proportions of the rich is six percentage points, those of the middle class 12 percentage points, and those of the poor 19 percentage points
In the meantime, in RW 3 the differences between the rich group based on the FGD results and that based on the CBMS is five points, the same difference goes for the middle class, and 10 percentage points for the poor
5.2 The Ranking of Inter-RW Family Welfare Cibulakan Village 
The ranking of inter-RW family welfare based on the FGD in Cibulakan Village is gathered from the village level FGD participants, while the ranking according to the CBMS was based on the village poverty level obtained by matching the family ranking from the PCA method with the village poverty line
Both results of the ranking are then compared
Table 5.3 shows that the CBMS results can rank the RW based on the family welfare precisely, matching the findings of the FGD participants in Cibulakan Village
Kedondong Village Table 5.4 shows that the ranking of RW 1 and RW 3 in Kedondong Village based on the opinions of the FGD participants are different from those based on the CBMS results, while RW 2 is put in the same ranking
The FGD participants believe that the family welfare in RW 1 is better than that in RW 3
There are several things supporting this argument
The FGD participants think that RW 1 is the most prosperous since there are many high-ranking government officials living in the area, and furthermore there are many residents who own cars, good houses, and many plots of lands
While this argument has its merits, the FGD participants failed to acknowledge that RW 1 has higher population compared to RW 3
Thus, although the number of rich families in RW 1 is higher than that in RW 3, it is also the case that there is many more poor families in RW 1 compared to RW 3
5.3 The Ranking of Inter-hamlet Family Welfare in Cibulakan Village 
Using the similar method as in the previous section, the ranking of inter-hamlet family welfare in Cibulakan Village is then compared as shown in Table 5.5
The same ranking of the inter-hamlet family welfare of FGD and CBMS shows that the CBMS results can rank the hamlets based on the family welfare precisely, matching the findings of the FGD participants in Cibulakan Village
5.4 The Ranking of Family Welfare in RT 1 RW 2 of Cibulakan Village 
It was previously mentioned that the classifications of family welfare in RT 1 RW 2 comprises of rich, middle class, poor and very poor groups
The FGD participants in RT 1 RW 2 were able to classifiy the family within the RT into the respective classifications
Unfortunately, the participants had problem ranking the families due to the large number of population in this RT
The ranking is as follows
five families classified as very poor; 47 families are considered poor; 46 families are classified into the middle class group; and 14 families belong to the rich group
The poor group can be further classified into other subgroups, namely upper-poor group, as many as 21 families, and the rest are included in the lower-poor group
5.5 The Ranking of Family Welfare in RT 1 RW 6 of Cibulakan Village 
The limited numbers of families (there are 60 families according to the community identification in 2006 and 2007 and 57 families from the CBMS census in 2005) helped the FGD participants to specify, compare, and rank the family welfare of each family in RT 1 RW 6
Therefore, the FGD results concerning the ranking of the family welfare in RT 1 RW 2 and CBMS can be compared
A simple way to compare both results of the ranking between the FGD outcome and those obtained from the CBMS calculation is by using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
The rank correlation coefficient, which is 0.76, shows that both the CBMS and FGD have identified the same family as very poor
This fact shows that CBMS is able to predict the ranking of family welfare accurately
5.6 The Ranking of Family Welfare in RT 4 RW 1 of Kedondong Village 
The limited numbers of families (There are 67 families according to the community identification in 2006 and 51 families from the CBMS census in 2005) helped the FGD participants to specify, compare, and rank the family welfare of each family in RT 4 RW 1
To compare FGD and CBMS results, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, which in this case results in a coefficient of 0.42, was used
Besides using the rank correlation, the FGD and CBMS family ranking results can be compared only regarding the poor families in RT 4 RW 1
The results show that the FGD participants classified 79% of the families as poor and they were also identified by CBMS as poor
It shows that CBMS is able to predict the ranking of family welfare accurately
5.7 The Ranking of Family Welfare in RT 6 RW 3 of Kedondong Village Given the relatively large number of residents in this RT, the FGD results and CBMS can only be compared based on their poverty status
The results show that 72% of the families identified by CBMS as poor are also considered as poor by the FGD participants
VI
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION 
In closing, by using Principal Component Analysis as a method to calculate the ranking of family welfare in each area, the CBMS can accurately arrange the order of inter-RW and inter-hamlet family welfares
The accuracy of the calculation is demonstrated in Cibulakan Village, which has exactly the same as the inter-RW ranking order obtained by both the calculation of CBMS and from FGDs
In addition, the proportions of family welfare in each RW of both villages show similar distribution patterns
On top of that, CBMS is also able to predict the ranking of family welfare with a high degree of precision
The high precision is also demonstrated from the high score of correlation rank between FGD participants and CBMS results which identify the same poor category for a family
Because of the high precision between the CBMS and the people's perception, it is proven that the CBMS result can improve targeting of beneficiaries in a poverty reduction program
Moreover, using CBMS means that subjectivity is not involved during targeting
Therefore, the activities conducted in each village would be more accountable and be able to reduce social protests
Based on the explanation and conclusions previously mentioned, CBMS will provide great help for the stakeholders, especially the local government, to conduct the census and identify the welfare level of each family in their respective areas

ABSTRACT 
Qualitative Baseline Study for PNPM Generasi and PKH
The Availability and Use of the Maternal and Child Health Services and Basic Education Services in the Provinces of West Java and East Nusa Tenggara This study explores the qualitative data on why some Indonesians do not use basic maternal and child health services and why some Indonesians do not send their children to primary or junior high schools
baseline for future PNPM Generasi (Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat Generasi Sehat dan Cerdas) and PKH (Program Keluarga Harapan) evaluations
Based on results of FGDs, in-depth interviews, and direct observations conducted in West Java and NTT, the study finds that physical access limitations and isolation, economic access limitations, and the belief in the traditional custom are the main reasons why some community members do not use modern mother and child health services for pre- and postnatal monitoring or for delivery
Problems related to physical access and financial access are also the main reasons for attrition and why some parents do not send their children to junior high school

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY I
Introduction 1.1 Background In mid-2007, the Government of Indonesia launched two pilot Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programs
These two pilot projects will be implemented in seven provinces, starting with Gorontalo and followed by West Sumatra, DKI Jakarta (Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta—Special Capital Region of Jakarta), West Java, East Java, North Sulawesi, and NTT (East Nusa Tenggara)
Both projects are designed to achieve the same objectives and goals, covering five of the eight MDGs (Millennium Development Goals)
to reduce poverty and hunger, to ensure universal coverage of basic education, to promote gender equality, and to reduce maternal mortality and child mortality
1.2 Objectives Complementing the quantitative baseline survey, this qualitative study for PNPM Generasi and PKH is used to help understand how and why the two programs work
It probes deeper into questions of service provision and demand, placing particular emphasis on the provider-user interaction as well as contextual factors within the communities that influence access to, use of, and provision of health and education services
The data and qualitative study results provide a baseline that will be used to measure the impact of the program in the same areas and analyze change over time
The specific objectives of the CCT qualitative baseline study are to (1) document the baseline conditions regarding basic health and education services specified in the programs, that is, the health of pregnant mothers during pregnancy, during delivery, and post- delivery, the health of under-fives, as well as primary school and junior high school education; and (2) understand underlying causes and factors that affect use and provision of services conditioned by CCT and are likely to influence project implementation and outcomes
The main research questions are (1) why do some Indonesians not use basic maternal and child health services
and (2) why do some Indonesians not send their children to primary or junior high schools
The answers to these questions will be examined from the supply side (provision of services) and the demand side (use of services)
1.3 Methodology This study employed a qualitative approach using in-depth interviews with key informants, focus group discussions (FGDs) with community members using (or not using) the facilities including separate groups of men and women, and direct observation by researchers in posyandui and both primary and junior high schools
The preparation stage of the study started in August 2007 and the fieldworks in 24 sample villages were conducted over one and a half months during September–October 2007
Each village spanned approximately one week
1.4 Sample Areas The provinces of West Java and East Nusa Tenggara were covered in this qualitative baseline study
From these two provinces, four districts and one city were selected
Sumedang District and North Central Timor (TTU—Timor Tengah Utara) District— regions that are planned to be the hosts for PNPM Generasi; as well as Cirebon District, South Central Timor (TTS—Timor Tengah Selatan) District, and Kupang City—regions that are planned to host PKH
Four treatment subdistricts, each of which is for PNPM Generasi and PKH, and three control subdistricts, each of which is for PNPM Generasi and PKH, have been selected as sample subdistricts from the aforementioned districts and city
In total, this qualitative baseline study was conducted in 24 villages, both rural and urban
II
Regional Characteristics Physical access to reach the majority of villages in NTT and isolated areas in West Java is difficult
In NTT, the majority of roads are rock-hardened and muddy when it rains
Several hamlets are separated by rivers without bridges and are thus often unable to be crossed during the rainy season
There are almost no rural transport facilities, with the exception of relatively expensive motorcycle taxis (ojek)
In West Java, several villages are relatively easy to access and have sufficient transportation facilities
Some villages have rural transportation available and almost all villages have many motorcycle taxis
Nevertheless, village transportation is insufficient in several remote villages and hamlets
Farming and fishing are the main livelihoods for the majority of people
The difference is that land in NTT is infertile and rocky, while West Java is a relatively fertile area
As a result, apart from relying on cash crops such as tamarind, farmers in NTT often rent or buy land outside the village and manage it for planting various types of seasonal crops
When undertaking these activities, the whole family leaves the village for several months at a time, including women in all stages of pregnancy
Livestock are also one of the economic efforts in NTT
There are more work alternatives in West Java than in NTT, which are made possible by easier access to large cities and subdistrict capitals
Particularly in coastal areas in West Java, due to a lack of fish in areas close to the main residential areas, fishermen often have to look for fish outside the region
Like in farming families, when a fisherman leaves the village in these times, the whole family, including pregnant women and school-aged children, usually follows
The majority of villages in NTT are not properly serviced by basic facilities such as electricity and water
The lack of water and electricity as well as the poor road conditions and insuffient transportation facilities mean that village midwives and teachers are unwilling to live in the village
In the majority of the studied areas in West Java, basic facilities are sufficient, except in coastal areas in Cirebon where residents must buy water for their cooking and drinking needs
III
Main Findings 3.1 Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Services 3.1.1 Supply There is a sufficient supply of modern MCH facilities in areas with easy access, but in areas far from reach, supply is still lacking
Village midwives, polindes,ii and posyandu are available
In several villages in West Java, communities can easily access privately practicing midwives, pustu,iii and puskesmas
In NTT, however, although there is a puskesmas in each subdistrict and a pustu in several subdistricts, these facilities are unpopular with communities in several areas because they are too distant
In urban areas, both in West Java and NTT, communities can access obstetricians and public hospital in the event that complications arise during either pregnancy or the delivery process
In NTT, particularly in isolated areas difficult to access, not all village midwives are willing to live in the village
Consequently, polindes are not operational
The village midwife lives in the village, she is often not there as she is caring for her parents who live in another village
In NTT, broad working territories mean that village midwives cannot service the entire community, even if the village midwife resides in the village
Some hamlets are located far away from the village midwife or the polindes
Ideally, in a broad working territory, there should be more than one midwife
All villages, in fact all hamlets, have a posyandu
Almost all are active, are routinely held each month, and are well-managed by three to five cadres
Nevertheless, attendance levels for posyandu participants (pregnant women and under-fives) are still low
To date, posyandu cadres have been central to MCH services and to other community services
Unfortunately, village administrations do not fully appreciate the presence of posyandu cadres, whereas their workload is heavy starting from servicing patients in the posyandu, observing community health conditions, and providing information to completing administrative tasks
This affects community members' willingness to become a posyandu cadre and because many posyandu cadres had to leave their assignments due to economic needs—for instance, by becoming an overseas migrant worker
Village midwives face their main obstacles in servicing the community when they try to reach certain groups, which are (1) those who are unaware or not particularly aware of the importance of MCH services, such as communities that still revere the customs (adat)
In NTT, this constitutes communities that still practice se'i,v while in West Java, this may be communities where men do not want their wife's genitals to be seen by another person; (2) farming communities that work in fields far from the main settlement; and (3) fishing communities who go to sea far from the village
Other obstacles for village midwives include the absence of transportation facilities to help them cover their large territories and isolated areas, the small number of village midwives, and irregular incomes
In NTT, village midwives are more reliant on income from the reimbursement of delivery fees from Askeskin (Asuransi Kesehatan Keluarga Miskin—Health Insurance for the Poor), which in reality are difficult to claim, while in West Java, patients are occasionally late in paying their installments for midwife services
Although their numbers are declining, dukun beranak (traditional birth attendants) are still operating
Between one and five dukun beranak are operating in each research village/kelurahan 
In several areas in NTT, the number of dukun beranak are actually increasing
In NTT, while in general the community uses midwife services, in areas difficult for the village midwife to reach, dukun beranak are involved in prenatal care, mainly in checking and correcting the foetus' position, and in the delivery process
Communication and cooperation between traditional (health) service providers and (modern) MCH service providers in the majority of sample areas are good
3.1.2 Demand In general, the majority of the community in the sample villages/kelurahan have good knowledge, understanding, and awareness of the importance of modern MCH services
Only in areas which are isolated and/or where a large number of the population is poor are there some community members who do not use modern MCH services
Some community members still only use a dukun beranak when giving birth and others only give birth with the assistance from their husband, parents, or other family members
During pregnancy and delivery, the majority of the community choose to be observed by the village midwife and after birth, they again have themselves and their infants checked by the village midwife
In discussions with groups of women and groups of men that are parents to under-fives, the village midwife often emerges as the first suggestion as the MCH service provider used during pregnancy and delivery, and after birth
Communities choose to use a village midwife based on their knowledge that medically, midwives can be relied upon
For example, they can be trusted to assist with risky deliveries, they have comprehensive equipment and medical supplies, they can give “suntik sehat” (pain killer and vitamin injections), and can provide referral letters to the hospital
In addition, people may choose to use a village midwife as they can pay the delivery fee in installments, even though the fees are relatively expensive compared to those of dukun beranak and obtain a birth certificate
Almost all children are immunized by the village midwife
However, some infants are not initially immunized usually because the parents are concerned that the infant will run a fever and will be fussy if they are immunized
Immunizations are mostly done at the posyandu
Although there is good community awareness about the importance of weighing infants and under-fives and most community members rely on posyandu, some still do not attend the posyandu
Reasons for this include that 
(1) the child does not want to go onto the scales; 
(2) they believe that the scales are inaccurate; 
(3) the child is ill; 
(4) they are unmotivated as the child has been fully immunized (for children over 3 years), no supplementary food is being provided, the location is not stimulating for children or there is no play area, usually the posyandu cadre collects them to take them to the posyandu, or the road is muddy; 
(5) the guardian is busy working or it is otherwise inconvenient, for example the mother is trading at the market, is at sea, or is harvesting; 
(6) no one is available to take the child, for instance, because the mother is a migrant worker and the grandmother is considered to be too old and unable to go to the posyandu; 
(7) parents have the false perception that a child's weight has no relation to health; 
(8) the mother is embarrassed to attend the posyandu because she has many children (more than five) and gives birth over the age of 45 years; and 
(9) there is flooding, meaning that the river is uncrossable
Although community knowledge and awareness of modern MCH services are good and the majority of the communiy have used modern MCH services, some community members still only use a dukun beranak
In addition, some women want to be assisted by the dukun beranak when delivering with the village midwife
Physical access limitations and isolation, economic access limitations, and belief in se'i in NTT are the main reasons why community members do not use modern MCH services for pre- and postnatal monitoring or for delivery
Isolation can be caused by great distances from modern MCH services; poor road conditions, including conditions where roads are difficult to pass, and there is a lack of transportation facilities and electricity; and a condition of not having a village midwife
Limited economic access is related to the high cost of delivery fees and transportation and can also lead to the need to work far from the main settlement
In addition, mothers who practice the se'i cannot go out for 40 days and are therefore inaccessable to the village midwife
Other causes for non-use of modern MCH services include that (1) the midwife is not available; (2) embarrassment or shame due to having many children or not wanting the pregnant woman's genitals to be seen by another person, (3) traditional belief in the use of dukun beranak services
Service quality does not dissuade community members from using modern MCH services, but some community members are dissatisfied with midwife services
Dissatisfaction is often related to the midwife's character, ineffective medicine, minimal experience of the midwife, difficulties in reaching the midwife, and a midwife's absence from the post
Actors at the village level that support the use of modern MCH services are village officials, the village midwife, posyandu cadres, religious figures, neighbors, spouse, extended family (mother or mother-in-law), and tokoh adat (experts in local customs)
Village officials conduct socialization, apply fines, and make visits to the houses of those who do not attend posyandu sessions to make them come
Posyandu cadres are highly active in urging the community to go to the posyandu, and together with the midwife, expain the importance of MCH
Posyandu cadres are a source of information about MCH, and help and information about general health for the community
Religious figures give support and encouragement in the use of modern MCH services
Villagers invite their neighbors and become their companions to go to posyandu, while spouse, extended family, and tokoh adat take part in influencing decisions made regarding which MCH services to use modern or traditional
3.2 Basic Education Services 3.2.1 Supply In terms of quantity, the existence of a primary school in each village is considered to be sufficient
However, from both the quantitative and qualitative sides, the facilities for teaching and learning activities and school infrastructure in West Java are still inadequate
The situation is more dire in NTT
In West Java, each village has two to three state primary schools, while on average, villages in NTT have only one primary school, the majority of which are private religious schools
Apart from having too few classes, many classrooms are no longer suitable to be used
the plasterboard is broken and school benches are unmaintained
Several primary schools do not have a library; if there is a library, conditions are poor and the book collection is lacking
This is also the case with visual aids and sporting equipment, which are still minimal
In NTT, there are still many schools, mainly primary schools, that only have thatched roofs, woven fibre walls, and dirt floors
In terms of quantity, there are too few junior high schools although the facilities for teaching and learning activities and school infrastructure are better than those in primary schools
State junior high schools are usually found in the subdistrict capital
In West Java, each subdistrict has more than three junior high schools, but in NTT there are usually only one or two
Great distances to junior high schools or their equivalent mean that they are unaccessible, leading to the need for schools that are closer to villages or a greater number of schools
Under normal conditions, primary schools have adequate capacities
In fact, several rural primary schools have student shortages
Problems emerge when the majority of the community living in urban areas with more than one primary school chooses a “favorite”, or popular, school
Capacity limitations also occur in popular junior high schools as usually the community chooses to send their children to the junior high school in the subdistrict capital
They may do this because the school in question is a state school or because it is the popular school even though it is further away than the alternatives
In order to overcome capacity limitations, school management in several regions have issued criteria for a student selection process; for instance, that primary school students must be at least 7 years old, prospective junior high school students must have grades that adhere to the school standards, and in NTT, schools also stipulate that students must have “birth certificates”
In almost all regions, children with mental disabilities are refused enrollment at primary school
To overcome the problems of distance and isolation, in the past two years, the government and communities in NTT have established combined primary and junior high schools in one location (SD-SMP Satu Atap) and a remote class of the main school, referred to as “small primary schools” (SD Kecil)
The main obstacles that popular schools and schools with damaged classrooms face are a lack of funds, which are needed to increase their capacity, a lack of teaching staff, particularly teachers of specific subjects (such as mathematics and science teachers), and the low teaching quality of teaching staff
Schools with low student numbers only receive a small amount of BOS (bantuan operasional sekolah— Operational Assistance for Schools) funds
Since the BOS program has been in place, it has been difficult for schools to ask the community to contribute to school funding due to the understanding that BOS funds are to be used to make school free
The main obstacles that teachers face are frequently-changing curriculums, low parental supervision of their children's education and nutritional intake, as well as the difficulties that students have in absorbing their lessons
Other obstacles that teachers face are the low prosperity level of teachers and limited available transportation to isolated areas as almost all teachers do not reside in the village in which they teach
In general, there are no obstacles to getting specific groups to send their children to primary school
However, this is not the case with the junior high school
Groups requiring special attention include (1) fishermen, (2) poor communities, (3) those living in isolated and remote areas, (4) communities that still revere the customs, (5) those who do not see the benefit in going to school and who do not see how going to school can benefit them in the future, (6) parents/guardians of girls, and (7) children with behavioral issues
Based on the results of direct observation in several schools, it is clear that teacher absenteeism is high
Several classes appeared to be empty, without a teacher, while several teachers were sitting in the teachers' room
In contrast to the direct observation, according to informants, teacher absenteeism is low, at less than 2 days per month because they are sick, are attending refresher courses or training, or have to attend to their family needs
living far from the school
Since schools have been receiving BOS funding, community participation in the provision of school facilities has tended to decline, although this is not true for isolated areas in NTT
In general, school committees at both the primary school and junior high school levels are not functioning to their full potential and generally only the committee leader has an active role
School committees are more involved in the provision of school facilities through fundraising efforts rather than in taking a role in helping to improve the quality of teaching and learning activities
3.2.2 Demand Community awareness of the importance of sending one's child to school is good as shown in their understanding regarding the benefits of school
Some still cannot see the benefit of going to school or they cannot see that they can have a better future by going to school
These opinions are also often connected to the absence of a role model whose success is due to their education
Some communities in NTT also prioritize the customs and honor
They are willing to sell livestock for customary needs, but not for their children's school needs
A small number of parents do not send their female children to junior high school as living unchaperoned in a boarding house may reduce the girl's belis, or bride price, value
Belis is the sum of money and gifts that a bride's family requests from the groom's family when they are to be married
The higher the physical and moral “quality” of a woman, the higher the belis that the bride's family may request from the groom's family
Problems related to physical access and financial access are the main reasons for attrition and are why some parents do not send their children to junior high school
Problems related with physical access or isolation are connected to great distances between home and schools; roads that are in poor condition, hilly, and muddy, and have unbridged river crossings; a lack of junior high school facilities or equivalent nearby; and lack of transportation facilities
Financial access problems are connected to the associated school costs and the cost of everyday family needs
Associated school costs include transportation costs, purchase of books, LKS (lembar kerja siswa—students' exercise sheets), school equipment, uniforms, and snack money
Parents' inability to fulfill these high associated education expenses cause students to become embarrassed or ashamed, finally resulting in attrition
In NTT, financial access problems are also related to parents' inability to pay absenteeism fines that a child may have accumulated
Another reason for attrition from junior high school or for not continuing to junior high school is that the child does not want to go to school
Children may instead choose to help their parents who may be experiencing financial difficulties by working or earning money 
they cannot see how going to school will afford them a better future
This may also be due to an inability to retain lessons, possibly caused by low nutritional intake, a lack of parental supervision, or behavioral issues
The majority of students have never been absent from school for an extended period
Generally, if a child is absent from school, it is because of being ill, having uncompleted homework, going home from the boarding house to pick up food for the following week (for junior high school students), attending to a customary ceremony or a family matter, or attending a market day
Economic reasons also cause students to be absent
During harvest time, students who do not directly help their parents in the fields are usually required to look after younger siblings or leave the village with their parents when the parents are working
In addition, financial limitations may mean that parents are unable to purchase a spare or replacement uniform for their child, so the child may truant if their only uniform is dirty or damaged
Several reasons for being absent from school are related to school or teacher quality, including inadequate school facilities and infrastructure, unstimulating or boring teaching methods, the teacher providing a poor example (for instance, the teacher often leaves class during lessons, inappropriate method of addressing or admonishing students), and the teacher often coming late to school
Actors at the village level who actively urge parents to send their children to school are village officials, school committees, and neighbors
Village officials, in particular, may issue fines to parents who do not send their children to school, may explain the importance of educating one's child to parents, and may make an effort to ensure that children who do not attend junior high school can participate in the Kejar Paket Bvii program
IV
Recommendations 1
Based on the above findings, PNPM Generasi and PKH administrators must focus on at least three main issues
(1) how both programs can respond to the main issues that frame why some people do not use modern MCH services and why some parents do not send their children to school, (2) how the programs can reach specific groups, and (3) how the participation of influential actors at the village level can be harnessed
Specific groups that must be reached are isolated and remote communities, the poor, farmers and fishermen that work far from their normal residence, groups that usually use dukun beranak due to traditions and beliefs, families with many children, groups that still venerate the customs rather than the importance of school, communities that do not value the importance of educating girls, and children who are unwilling to attend school
Taking note of data and information obtained in the field and the methodologies used, researchers that conduct impact assessments and program evaluations need to pay attention to the following aspects
Researchers should look deeper into specific topics, such as the policy of fines, various community initiatives in the provision of facilities and urging the use of modern MCH and basic education services, the role of institutions, dynamics in the relationship between officials and the community, community structure, social capital, the provision of supplementary food at posyandu and schools, and observing locations where children absent from school congregate during school hours, and gender dimensions
Informants should not be limited to specific informants, depending on the needs and comprehensiveness of information obtained in the field (via snowballing method), so there is clarification and triangulation of information
In connection with point b above, informants at each level should not only be limited to specific informants
For example, at the subdistrict level, group interviews should be held with the subdistrict head and subdistrict staff that handle or are knowledgable about MCH services, basic education, and the village context
Then, at the village level, hamlet heads, head section of welfare affairs, and others should be interviewed
A longer period of time (at least 10 days) is needed to conduct field research in each village
INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background In mid-2007, the Government of Indonesia launched two pilot Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programs
the Community Conditional Cash Transfer (PNPM Generasi Sehat dan Cerdas—PNPM Generasi) and the Household Conditional Cash Transfer (Program Keluarga Harapan—PKH)
These two pilot projects will be implemented in seven provinces, starting with Gorontalo and followed by West Sumatra, DKI Jakarta (Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta—Special Capital Region of Jakarta), West Java, East Java, North Sulawesi, and NTT (Nusa Tenggara Timur—East Nusa Tenggara)
Both projects are designed to achieve the same objectives and goals
to reduce poverty and hunger, to ensure universal coverage of basic education, to promote gender equality, and to reduce maternal mortality and child mortality
In the PNPM Generasi, block grants will be allocated to communities rather than to individual targeted households
Applying the principles of community-driven development, communities will decide how best to use the block grants to reach several education and health targets
The PNPM Generasi approach builds extensively upon the work of the Kecamatan Development Project (KDP)
The PKH version applies the traditional CCT design with quarterly cash transfers to poor individual households identified through Statistics Indonesia (BPS) data
The PKH recipient households will receive regular cash transfers through the post office as long as they meet the requirements of using specified health and education services
Both CCT versions target the same 12 indicators as conditions for the routine receipt of the programs
Indicators in the health sector comprise the requirement for pregnant women to undertake prenatal checks at health institutions and to receive and take iron supplements; 
the requirement to deliver with the assistance of a trained health professional; 
the requirement for postnatal care visits for both mother and infant; 
the requirement for children aged 0–11 and 12–59 months to receive the complete schedule of immunizations (BCG, DPT, polio, measles, and hepatitis B) and additional immunizations as well as to be routinely weighed; 
and the requirement of children aged 6–11 months to receive Vitamin A
In addition, the education indicators involve the requirement for all the PKH recipients to enroll their school-aged children into primary school2 or junior high school3 and to ensure a minimum attendance rate of 85%
In the PNPM Generasi, conditionality will be placed in terms of performance-based financial incentives to villages
Village performance on the twelve indicators will be measured, compiled, and compared with other villages in the subdistrict during an inter- village meeting at the end of the project cycle
The PKH recipient households are required to visit health facilities and attend schools in order to receive their full benefits
Health facilities and schools will regularly report nonuse of the PKH recipient households' conditioned services to the subdistrict CCT management office
If a PKH recipient household fails to comply with the conditions after a few warnings, the cash transfers will be terminated
So that both programs' effectiveness can be better measured, both quantitative and qualitative baseline data are necessary
The data will become the basis for the evaluation of the programs' impacts in the same areas of study
The programs' effectiveness is measured by comparing conditions before and after the programs are carried out
One use of the study results will be to provide input for the implementation of the PNPM Generasi and PKH
The data and information about the supply of and demand for maternal and child health (MCH) services and basic education services will become baseline data for the future evaluation of both programs
1.2 Study Objectives This qualitative study will be used to help understand ‘how' and ‘why' the two programs work
It will also provide the background for the social context in several program locations
The data and qualitative study results will provide a baseline that will be used to analyze change over time
Complementing the quantitative baseline survey, the CCT qualitative baseline study will probe deeper into questions of service provision and demand, placing particular emphasis on the provider-user interaction as well as contextual factors within the communities that influence access to, use of, and provision of health and education services
The specific objectives of the CCT qualitative baseline study are to 1
document the baseline conditions regarding basic health and education services specified in the CCT program, that is, the health of pregnant mothers during pregnancy, during delivery, and post-delivery, the health of children under five, as well as primary school and junior high school education; and 2
understand the underlying causes and factors that affect use and provision of services conditioned by CCT and that are likely to influence project implementation and outcomes
The main research questions are (1) why do some Indonesians not use basic maternal and child health services and (2) Why do some Indonesians not send their children to primary or junior high schools
The answers to these questions will be examined from the supply side (provision of services) and the demand side (use of services)
Table 1 provides the details of the main questions
1.3 Methodology The field research of this study, which was conducted over one and half months during September–October 2007 or which in each village spanned approximately 1 week, employed a qualitative approach
The approach instruments consist of in-depth interviews with key informants, focus group discussions (FGDs) with community members using (or not using) the facilities including separate groups of men and women, and direct observation by researchers in posyandu (pos pelayanan terpadu—integrated health service post) and both primary and junior high schools
The list of informants and FGDs of each village is presented in Appendix 1
The in-depth interviews with key informants were conducted using question guides
Approximately eight to ten informants were interviewed at the village level, consisting of the village head or lurah, community leaders, midwives, posyandu cadres, traditional birth attendants (dukun beranak), primary school principals, primary school committee heads, and a group of primary school teachers
FGD were conducted using question and discussion guides
Eight FGDs were held in each village
FGDs with two groups of mothers of under-fives (one in a hamlet close to the village center or active posyandu and one in the farthest hamlet from the village center or without an active posyandu),
two groups of fathers of under-fives (one in a hamlet close to the village center or active posyandu and one in the farthest hamlet from the village center or without an active posyandu), 
one group of mothers of primary school-aged children, 
one group of fathers of primary school-aged children, 
one group of mothers of junior high school-aged children, 
and one group of fathers of junior high school-aged children
Direct observation was also used to monitor the implementation of posyandu services in 18 active posyandu and the implementation of education in 24 primary and 15 junior high schools during school hours
Several posyandu in various villages/cities could not be monitored as there were no posyandu sessions scheduled during the field visits.
Several posyandu observations were conducted after the main fieldworks had been completed
Observation of several schools was also rescheduled considering that while the main field research was conducted, teaching activities in primary and junior high schools were disrupted for several reasons, including shortened school hours due to the start of the fasting month, examinations being held, or village or religious activities
The results of each observation were documented using a standardized observation form
The results of all interviews and FGDs were compiled into complete field notes
Field notes from each interview and FGD were organized, typed up, and expanded to answer all of the questions set forth in the question guidelines
Each FGD and interview was documented according to informant lists noting the date of the interview; the name of the note taker, interviewer, or facilitator; and the informant's name
1.4 Sample Areas The qualitative baseline study for the two CCT programs was conducted in West Java and NTT, two of the six provinces covered in the quantitative baseline study NTT, Gorontalo, North Sulawesi, West Java, East Java, and Jakarta
The criteria for the selection of the two provinces were based on the level of poverty and the limited time of only one and a half months that were set aside for the field research
Between one and three districts/cities were chosen in each province to represent the PNPM Generasi and PKH, both treatment and control, using the same selection criteria of poverty levels and ease of access
In West Java Province, the two districts chosen were Sumedang and Cirebon
Sumedang was chosen to represent a region that is planned to host the PNPM Generasi and which has a relatively low poverty rate, while Cirebon was chosen to represent a region planned to host the PKH and which has a relatively high poverty rate
In NTT Province, the two districts and one city chosen were North Central Timor (TTU—Timor Tengah Utara) District, South Central Timor (TTS—Timor Tengah Selatan) Province, and the City of Kupang
TTU was chosen to represent a rural area which is planned to host the PNPM Generasi and has a high poverty rate
TTS was chosen to represent a rural area which is planned to host the PKH and has a high poverty rate
Kupang was chosen to represent an urban area that is also planned to host the PKH and has a relatively low poverty rate
One to three subdistricts were then chosen for each district/city after the researchers had obtained sufficient data and information from the health offices and education offices at the district/city level
The subdistricts were chosen based on a combination of data from both sectors, the list of subdistricts from the quantitative survey, regional spread, and access to the district/city capital
Data from the district level included the school discontinuation rates/levels of those not continuing to junior high school, gross/net enrollment rates (angka partisipasi kasar/murni/APK/APM), maternal mortality rates, the prevalence of malnutrition, the prevalence of dukun beranak, and service coverage
In West Java, five rural subdistricts (Rancakalong, Buahdua, and Darmaraja in Sumedang; Gegesik Kulon and Susukan in Cirebon) and two subdistricts with urban characteristics (Mundu and Gunung Jati,5 both in Cirebon) were chosen
In NTT, five rural subdistricts (North Biboki, Insana, and East Miomaffo in TTU; Kie and Batu Putih in TTS) and two urban subdistricts (Alak dan Maulaffa in Kupang City) were chosen
Maps of the selected districts and subdistricts are presented in Appendices 2–6
Distance from the puskesmas and level of posyandu activity were additional criteria used to determine the sample 
villages/kelurahan and the posyandu schedule was also taken into consideration
Based on the above criteria, a total of 24 villages/kelurahan were chosen for the study (Table 2)
In each village/kelurahan, two areas, usually hamlets (dusun), were chosen as study sites at the community level
one close to and one far from the village center and MCH services, or one site close to an active posyandu and one site without an active posyandu
Because almost all posyandu are active, apart from considering a hamlet's distance from the village center and MCH services, sites were chosen based on the coverage of the posyandu (one with high coverage and one with low coverage)
FGD participants for the discussion of MCH were usually chosen from the list of posyandu participants using several criteria that excluded village officials, civil servants, teachers, migrants (perantau), and those difficult to invite to the discussion
Efforts were made to ensure that pregnant women were among the participants
For the discussions of primary and junior high schools, community members with children of primary school and junior high school ages were chosen, with the same exclusions as for the MCH FGDs
Efforts were also made to include parents of children who had withdrawn from school or had not continued their education
In most cases, information obtained from posyandu cadres was usually used to determine FGD participants, as the cadres knew the majority of community members
If there were more than one primary school or junior high school in a village/kelurahan, the school of each level receiving the most children from the selected hamlet was chosen for observation
In the majority of cases, the schools were selected after the FGDs for primary and junior high schools were held

II
SAMPLE REGION CHARACTERISTICS As outlined in the introductory chapter and in accordance with the selection framework for sample locations in rural areas, two sample villages were chosen in each selected subdistrict
one village easily accessible and the other relatively difficult to access
The level of accessibility was not always measured in terms of the villages' distance from the subdistrict center; rather, it also depended on road conditions and the availability of public transportation from and to the sample villages
The subdistrict center was used as a criterion considering that this is usually where MCH services (puskesmas) and basic education services (at the SMP level) are generally located
In urban areas, particularly in Cirebon District, West Java, sample locations were selected based on the consideration that the chosen villages were characterized as urban and were also coastal villages
Two sample subdistricts directly bordering the region of Cirebon City were chosen as representatives of urban areas in Cirebon District and from each subdistrict, one coastal village characterized as the most urban in the subdistrict was chosen
Also, in Kupang City, NTT, the most densely populated kelurahan was chosen from each of the two sample subdistricts
with the additional consideration that both kelurahan must have the highest number of dukun beranak
2.1 Research Locations All sample villages in Sumedang and Cirebon districts are easily reached; the farthest village is only located 6–7 kilometers (km) from the subdistrict center
In this study, the rural villages characterized as easily accessible are located in the subdistrict center or villages directly bordering the subdistrict center
The villages falling under this category consist of Nagarawangi village in Rancakalong Subdistrict, Buahdua village in Buahdua Subdistrict, Sukaratu village in Darmaraja Subdistrict, Gegesik Kulon village in Gegesik Subdistrict, and Susukan village in Susukan Subdistrict
The communities in these villages can easily reach MCH services and basic education facilities, either those located in the local subdistrict or those in other subdistricts or the district capital, or other cities
The main district road serviced by the intercity public buses travelling between subdistricts and districts/cities also passes the villages
Sukaratu village is serviced by the alternative main road connecting Tasikmalaya City and Jakarta, while both villages in Gegesik Subdistrict are also passed by the district road serviced by the public buses connecting Indramayu and Cirebon City via Arjawinangun
Moreover, in Cirebon District, Mertasinga village in Gunung Jati Subdistrict and Mundu Pesisir village in Mundu Subdistrict are both located along the busy northern coastal road and close to Cirebon City, and so have quite a selection of available transportation facilities
In both the selected districts in West Java, the sample villages that are relatively difficult to access are only between 2 and 7 kilometers from the subdistrict center
However, it is still difficult to access public transport in two villages
Pamekaran village in Rancakalong Subdistrict, Sumedang; and Tangkil village in Susukan Subdistrict, Cirebon
In Pamekaran village, public transportation is unable to enter the village and is only operational at certain times, while in Tangkil village, especially the farthest hamlet, the community must walk or use a motorcycle taxi (ojek) costing around Rp5,000 for each journey to reach the main district road serviced by the public bus
As in West Java, in TTU and TTS districts, the majority of sample villages that are easily reached are relatively close to the subdistrict center
In particular, Boentuka village in Batu Putih Subdistrict is on the main Kupang–Soe road
For the sample villages that are relatively difficult to access like Taunbaen village in North Biboki Subdistrict, Susulaku village in Insana Subdistrict, Kuanek village in East Miomaffo Subdistrict, Falas village in Kie Subdistrict, and Oehela village in Batu Putih Subdistrict, the majority of roads are damaged, rocky, and winding
During the wet season, these roads become muddy and slippery, and vehicles cannot pass
Access to all sample villages in West Java and NTT is presented in Appendix 7
From the regional topography perspective, all villages in Sumedang District are located in highlands and most border other villages from the same subdistrict
However, there are also villages that directly border forest or mountain regions or that border a different district
Only Sukaratu village in Darmaraja Subdistrict has a relatively flat area
Furthermore, in Buahdua Subdistrict, both sample villages are passed by several rivers
All villages in TTU and TTS districts are also located in hilly highlands
In contrast, in Cirebon District, sample villages are generally located in low-lying areas, especially Mertasinga and Mundu Pesisir villages that are coastal villages, are bordered by a river that flows to the Java Sea, and directly border the area of Cirebon City
Two kelurahan in Kupang City are also in low-lying areas that are relatively close to the beach
As shown in Appendix 8, administratively, the sample villages in West Java consist of three to five hamlets
The majority of the villages consist of 8 RW,7 with a range of between 5 and 14 RW, and all villages have more than 20 RT,8 In NTT, there are generally fewer hamlets, RW, and RT in each village than there are in the villages in West Java
2.2 Natural and Economic Resources The agricultural sector has become the ‘pillar of life' for the majority of communities in rural areas, both in West Java and NTT
Most communities in West Java are more reliant upon the subsector of food crops that are supported by fertile land conditions, while in NTT, dryland food crops are favored due to the less supportive land conditions in the region
The majority of NTT communities are also reliant on annual or tree crops
Apart from the unfertile land, rainfall is also very low
As a result, communities in NTT are also reliant on the livestock industry and estate crops
The majority of communities in all sample villages in Sumedang District work as lowland rice field laborers
This work is not only done by men; the women are also involved, mainly during the planting, clearing, and harvest times
This is reflected in the proportion of land use which is dominated by agricultural fields, mainly lowland rice fields
Apart from rice, some communities work on secondary crops such as corn, peanuts, and cassava as well as vegetables such as long beans, eggplant, cucumber, and chili as alternate crops
In Bojongloa village, Buahdua Subdistrict, some also have estate crops such as coconut, coffee, clove, pepper, and vanilla bean
Apart from that, they also plant fruits such as mango, papaya, and rambutan although in a limited scale and only regarded as “back yard” crops
Other forms of work often undertaken by sample village communities include agricultural laborers, traders (kiosks or trading in Jakarta), tradespeople (builders, carpenters), motorcycle taxi operators, livestock farmers, laborers or other private employees, and civil servants (including retirees)
In addition, child labor was found in several villages, with the children mainly working as laborers in home industries, motorcycle taxi operators, public transport conductors, domestic workers, and traders
There are more community members working as farm laborers in the majority of sample villages in Cirebon District, when in fact Gegesik Subdistrict is known as the rice barn (lumbung beras) of Cirebon District
As a matter of fact, lowland rice fields dominate the village area
The coastal communities in Mundu Pesisir and Mertasinga villages are mainly fishermen
Other people in Cirebon work as traders, industrial laborers, tradespeople (builders, carpenters), motorcycle or pedicab operators, drivers, and, specifically for many women, migrant workers in Saudi Arabia
In TTU and TTS districts, the majority of communities work not only as farmers planting corn, sweet potato, cassava, peanut, and upland rice, but also as livestock farmers and plantation pickers for crops such as tamarind, areca nut, cashew nut, coconut, and candlenut
Other than that, some also work as traders, motorcycle taxi operators, or civil servants
The majority of community members in the two sample kelurahan in Kupang City work in the services sector as traders, laborers, civil servants, or retirees
With the exception of Fatufetto village, where some also work as fishermen
Housing in Sumedang District are already dominated by permanent buildings, with only a small proportion of semipermanent rumah panggung (a traditional, raised, timber and bamboo sheeting house) remaining
In Cirebon District, housing is also dominated by permanent buildings, except in Jagapura Kidul village, Gegesik Subdistrict, which is still dominated by semipermanent and temporary housing
In villages where some community members work as migrant workers, a fair number of permanent houses have recently been built or are under construction, using the resulting wages
In contrast, in the sample villages in TTU, the majority of houses only have thatched roofs made from reed, walls made from sheets of woven dry palm leaves, and dirt floors
However, in the two kelurahan in Kupang City, housing is dominated by permanent houses
In West Java, electricity from the State Electricity Enterprise (PLN—Perusahaan Listrik Negara) is the main source of lighting in all sample villages, while in NTT not all villages are reached by electricity
Several villages in NTT, like Taunbaen village in North Biboki Subdistrict, both villages in East Miomaffo Subdistrict, and both villages in Kie Subdistrict still use oil lamps and only a small minority have used generators or solar energy
In the villages serviced by electricity, only some community members are able to access it and it only supplies a limited amount of power
Some of the villages in Sumedang District pipe clean water to houses, which is made possible through the community's initiative, while some other community members still use pump wells or dug wells
The majority of sample villages in Cirebon District also experience difficulty obtaining clean water
They cannot use ground water due to intrusion from sea water, so some are forced to buy clean water for drinking
Communities in NTT face even more serious clean water scarcity
Clean water is scarce in the dry season
In Oehela village, Batu Putih Subdistrict, the people must walk for about 30 minutes to reach a source of clean water
In several villages in West Java, mainly villages located in the subdistrict center, the community can easily access economic facilities such as the market and shops (Buahdua, Susukan, and Mundu Pesisir villages)
Apart from that, several villages are home to manufacturing industries
For example, In Nagarawangi village, Rancakalong Subdistrict, there are clothing, furniture, and palm-fibre broom household industries, while Gegesik Kulon village is also home to snackfood processing industry and the waste collection and trading business is growing
In Mundu Pesisir village, there are both large- and small- scale manufacturing industries
2.3 Populations The total population and number of households in the sample villages in Sumedang District are smaller than those in the sample villages in Cirebon District
This is reflected by both the number of household members in each household, which averages at around three household members per household in the sample villages in Sumedang District, and more than three household members per household in Cirebon District; in fact, in Mertasinga village, Gunung Jati Subdistrict, there are five household members per household
In terms of population density, sample villages in Sumedang District generally have less than 900 people per square kilometer (people/km2); in fact, Bojongloa village only has around 600 people/km2
However, there is an exception in Sukaratu village, Darmaraja Subdistrict, which has a population density reaching 1,979 people/km2, which exceeds population densities in the sample villages in Cirebon District
The population number and density in sample villages in TTU and TTS districts are certainly far lower than those in the sample villages in West Java
There is a large difference in the population densities in the two urban villages in Cirebon District
In Mundu Pesisir village, it is around 3,784 people/km2, while in Mertasinga village, it is far higher, at 8,231 people/km2
In the two sample kelurahan in Kupang City, it is even higher, reaching more than 8,400 people/km2, as shown in Appendix 9
In terms of the ratio of men to women, in the villages in Sumedang District, women seem to outnumber men, except in Bojongloa village, Buahdua Subdistrict, and Neglasari village, Darmaraja Subdistrict
In Cirebon District, the reverse is the case; in four of the six sample villages, there are more men than women
In the sample villages in TTU and TTS districts, there also tend to be more men than women, with the exception of Oehela village
In Kelurahan Fatufetto, there are equal proportions of men to women, while in Kelurahan Naikolan, there are more women than men
The majority of the population in both West Java and NTT only enjoy a primary school education
In fact, in both coastal villages in Cirebon District particularly, many of the FGD participants did not graduate from primary school; they generally discontinued their schooling in grades four and five
2.4 Community Groups and Institutions Standard institutions at the village/kelurahan level should consist of
BPD (badan permusyawaratan desa—village people's consultative assembly), which monitors the performance of village officials; 
LPM (Lembaga Pemberdayaan Masyarakat—Institute for the Empowerment of Rural Community), which helps village/kelurahan heads to implement village development; 
Karang taruna, which coordinates various youth activities such as arts and sports; 
PKK (Program Kesejahteraan Keluarga—Family Welfare Program), headed by the wife of the village/kelurahan head), which coordinates women's activities; and 
Kelompok Tani (Farmers Group), which coordinates farmers' activities (specifically in the sample villages in West Java, it is known as Mitra Cai (Ulu-Ulu), which is responsible for the distribution of irrigation water)
All of the above village organizations are not always found or mentioned in each sample village, either in West Java or in NTT
Moreover, the performance of each organization differs between the sample villages, as seen in Appendix 10
The presence of these various formal institutions has not yet been fully utilized in efforts to improve the coverage of health and basic education services
Nevertheless, in several villages, organizations such as PKK have been involved in various activities encompassing MCH services, like in Darmaraja Subdistrict
In this subdistrict, PKK is highly supportive of posyandu activities and always coordinates with village midwives, including in their activities to get their village to reach the status of a Desa Siaga.
The same is true for the existence of karang taruna, which is particularly beneficial for and relevant to various health- and education-related activities at the village level
In several sample villages in NTT, the community worked together with the village board and the church on an initiative to build various support facilities for schools although the conditions tend to be limited
For example, in two villages in North Biboki Subdistrict, a small primary school was built in an isolated hamlet to increase the primary school's capacity and to ease access to school
A similar thing has occurred in Oehela village, Batu Putih Subdistrict
the community and local village officials had taken the initiative to build a kindergarten
In two villages in East Miomaffo Subdistrict, the community had built a dormitory for SMP students in order to overcome the problem of distance, and therefore, the students do not need to go to and fro between home and school each day
Apart from formal institutions, organizations or community groups focused on religious, economic, and social activities, including customary institutions, were found in several sample villages
It is estimated that in every village in West Java, there are religion-based community groups such as kelompok pengajian (Koran reciting groups) and majelis taklim (forums where Islamic sermons are given)
The same can be said for NTT, which has thriving church community activities
In North Biboki and East Miomaffo subdistricts, there is a youth organization similar to karang taruna called Mudika (Muda-mudi Katolik, or Catholic Youth)
Particularly in the village of Jagapura Kidul, Gegesik Subdistrict, there are quite many Islamic education foundations which play a large role in the provision of basic and further education facilities
2.5 Health and Education Facilities 2.5.1 Health Facilities MCH service facilities available at the village/kelurahan and subdistrict levels are dominated by government health services such as puskesmas, secondary puskesmas (pustu), or mobile puskesmas (pusling), and polindes (pos persalinan desa—village maternity post) with the village midwife, followed by privately practicing midwives and posyandu activities
In emergencies, if the midwife and puskesmas are unable to handle a complicated delivery, the patient will be referred to the regional public hospital (RSUD—rumah sakit umum daerah) owned by the local government and generally located in the district capital
In almost all sample villages, there is a polindes managed by a village midwife
In addition, in each subdistrict, there is a puskesmas and in several villages, there is also a pustu
For isolated regions in NTT, puskesmas also provide a mobile facility (a pusling) which services the community three times per week
Posyandu are found in almost every hamlet, or even every RW, and provide routine services once each month
The availability of MCH service facilities in the sample villages can be seen in Appendix 11
Each posyandu is usually managed by three to five cadres
In Sumedang District, posyandu activities are scheduled for a specific date each month, with the exception of Sukaratu village, Darmaraja Subdistrict
Because the local village midwife is currently undertaking further midwifery studies (D310 Kebidanan), the posyandu activities are scheduled for each Thursday when the midwife can attend
In Cirebon District, posyandu activities are generally scheduled for particular days and weeks, but some are more flexible, for example Mertasinga village, depending on the activities of the local women
In NTT, specifically in TTU and TTS provinces, posyandu activities are scheduled for specific dates
In West Java, some posyandu activities are held at their own post, but some others use the house of a cadre, a community figure, the village office, polindes or pustu, or even the puskesmas
In NTT, some posyandu activities are conducted in the village lopo,11 the polindes, or a cadre's house like in Falas village
In Boentuka and Oehela villages, Batu Putih Subdistrict, and Sekon village, Insana Subdistrict, all posyandu activities in each village are based in the one polindes and are conducted simultaneously
This way, the village midwife can more easily coordinate the activities
However, a negative consequence is that the community must travel a reasonably great distance to go to the specific polindes
In West Java, although not all villages have a polindes, midwife services can be accessed very easily considering that generally the midwife stays or lives in the village or close to the village to which they are assigned
Almost all village midwives also open a practice outside the health office's working hours
Consequently, the community can also easily access the village midwife or private midwife services
Nevertheless, dukun beranak services are still used by a small proportion of the community in both Sumedang and Cirebon districts
In contrast to the conditions in West Java, in NTT, specifically in the villages in TTU and TTS districts, village midwife practices are not available because the people in the community cannot afford it
In Kupang City, although it is relatively easy for the community to access midwife practices, the use of dukun beranak services is still quite high
Communities in the sample villages in West Java can access puskesmas or pustu relatively easily, and in fact, some subdistricts in the province have two puskesmas, like Gegesik Subdistrict in Cirebon
Several sample villages in West Java host the puskesmas, such as Buahdua village in Sumedang District and Susukan and Mertasinga villages in Cirebon District
Apart from that, some villages have a pustu, like Pamekaran village in Sumedang District
For the other sample villages, while the puskesmas or pustu is located outside the village, it is still easy to access due to the available public transportation services
In NTT, only Taunbaen village in North Biboki Subdistrict has a pustu
The communities in other villages must access the puskesmas or pustu outside the village
This does not occur in urban areas
Communities in both kelurahan in Kupang City can reach the puskesmas relatively easily; Kelurahan Fatufetto even has a pustu
2.5.2 Education Facilities Primary school facilities are available in all sample villages in both West Java and NTT, while the majority of junior high school facilities are only found in subdistrict centers
The government still has a dominant role in the provision of school facilities at the primary and junior high schools; however, in several regions, the role of private groups is also no less important in broadening the scope of basic education services
In several villages in NTT, there are only private religious primary schools, such as Catholic primary schools (SDK— sekolah dasar Katolik)
In West Java, each sample village has two to three primary schools, while in NTT, each sample village/kelurahan has one to three primary schools
In villages/kelurahan with more than one primary school, the schools are scattered over several hamlets, so the communities can easily access the closest school (Appendix 12)
In TTU District, in an effort to move school facilities closer to the community, principals and teachers cooperated with village officials and the local community to build an additional class in the most remote hamlet
In Taunbaen village, for example, a “small class” (SD Kecil) which services grade one to grade three students was opened, while in Hauteas village, two “far classes” (kelas jauh) have been built
Some sample villages have a junior high school, while the communities in other villages must access them outside the village
In West Java, it is relatively easy for the community to access junior high schools
They are also able to reach other schools outside the subdistrict region
For example, the community in Tangkil village can access the junior high schools in Caringin and Arjawinangun subdistricts
The community in Mundu Pesisir village can also access the junior high school in Arjawinangun Subdistrict or Cirebon City
In Pamekaran village, Sumedang District, it is not difficult to reach SMPN (Sekolah Menengah Pertama Negeri) I (State Junior High School I) Rancakalong, a favorite school, from the village, but because there is no four-wheeled public transportation servicing the village, only motorcycle taxi services, transportation costs are expensive and students must walk
The availability of private religious schools also provides an additional choice for communities
Such schools have a more prominent role in Cirebon District
In Gegesik and Mundu subdistricts, for example, there are several Islamic primary schools (madrasah ibtidaiah—MI) and Islamic junior high schools (madrasah sanawiah—MTs), as well as several other primary and junior high schools that have been established under the name of a particular Islamic foundation
III
AVAILABILITY AND USE OF MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH SERVICES The results of the latest monitoring of Indonesia's performance towards achieving the MDGs in 2007 (UNDP-Bappenas 2007) show that the indicators for reaching goal number 4, a reduction in child mortality rates, have improved
This is shown by the infant mortality rate (IMR), which has experienced a reduction from 57 (57 deaths per 1,000 live births) in 1994 to 35 in 2002–2003, and the under-five mortality rate (U5MR), which in the same years has fallen from 81 (81 deaths per 1,000 live births) to 46
The province of NTT has the third highest IMR in Indonesia after West Nusa Tenggara (NTB—Nusa Tenggara Barat) and Gorontalo at 46, while West Java has the ninth highest IMR at 37
In addition, the indicators for achieving goal number 5, the improvement of maternal health, have also slightly improved
The maternal mortality rate (MMR) has fallen from 390 (390 deaths per 100,000 live births) in 1994 to 307 deaths in 2002–2003, while the proportion of deliveries assisted by skilled birth attendants in 2006 reached 72.41% (UNDP-Bappenas 2007)
Although this shows a tendency to improve, each year around 20,000 women still die as a result of pregnancy or childbirth complications which cannot yet be completely handled
With such conditions, it is predicted that the MDGs' 2015 targets cannot be met
The direct causes of maternal deaths are haemmorage (30%), eclampsia or poisoning in pregnancy (25%), long delivery (5%), abortion complications (5%), and infections (12%)
The risk of death can increase if the mother is suffering from anemia or chronic fatigue, or has an infectious disease (UNDP-Bappenas 2007)
Data for the performance indicators for the decline in IMR and the increase in maternal health is presented in Table 3
The above data shows that the availability (supply) and use (demand) of MCH services still face a number of problems, so service coverage is not yet optimal
The following sections will explain the current conditions of supply of and demand for MCH services
3.1 Supply, Conditions, and Coverage of Basic Maternal and Child Health Services It cannot be denied that community demand for modern MCH services is highly influenced by the supply of services at the village level
With the availaibility of MCH services located close to community residences, the community becomes more aware of the existence of the facilities and can be expected to use them
For years, the government has endeavored to fulfill community need for MCH services, by providing village midwives, polindes, and pustu at the village level
The expectation that these facilities will easily reach the community
In fact, these days the local governments (puskesmas and village administrations) in several areas in West Java that are remote from polindes have undertaken an initiative to implement treatment posts—several of them reaching the RT level
However, these MCH facilities are still insufficient, particularly in isolated regions
Scarcity of modern MCH workers in these regions is one of the causes why the communities use traditional MCH service facilities
3.1.1 Supply of Modern MCH Service Facilities There is a sufficient supply of modern MCH facilities in areas with easy access, but in areas far from reach, supply is still lacking
Village midwives, polindes, and posyandu are available
In several villages in West Java, communities can easily access privately practicing midwives, pustu, and puskesmas
In NTT, however, although there is a puskesmas in each subdistrict and a pustu in several subdistricts, these facilities are unpopular with communities in several areas because they are too distant
In urban areas, both in West Java and NTT, communities can access obstetricians
They can also access the closest public hospital in the event that complications arise during either pregnancy or the delivery process
For isolated areas far from the reach of modern MCH services, additional health facilities are still required, as stated by one village head in Rancakalong, Sumedang, West Java, Health facilities are still considered to be lacking because we are too far from facilities and equipment is lacking
”In NTT, particularly in isolated areas difficult to access, not all village midwives are willing to live in the village, and consequently, polindes are not operational
For example, in East Miomaffo Subdistrict, TTU, out of the 11 villages that have a village midwife, only 6 of the midwives live in the village
While the other five village midwives do operate the polindes each day, they do not actually reside in the village
The midwives in Kuanek and Oenenu villages, East Miomaffo, TTU live in Kefamanu, the district capital of TTU, due to family obligations
Another example is found in Sekon village, Insana, TTU
While the village midwife lives in the village, she is often not there as she is caring for her parents who live in another village
This makes it difficult for the community to access health services in the evening or in an emergency
They must instead walk for kilometers along a steep road to the modern MCH services in a neighboring village
If it rains, the road becomes muddy and slippery
The lack of transportation facilities means that the community must pay a significant fare for a motorcycle taxi
Since 2002, Falas village in Kie Subdistrict, TTS, NTT has not had a village midwife
The community is only serviced by the head nurse during posyandu and pusling services, while the coordinating midwife or officers from Kie Puskesmas only occasionally come to observe
As there is no village midwife, the polindes is also inactive
A lack of water has also meant that a village midwife is not prepared to live in the polindes or the village
To date, there has been no replacement midwife in the village
In NTT, broad working territories mean that village midwives cannot service the entire community, even if the village midwife resides in the village
Some hamlets are remote, located up to 10 kilometers from the village midwife or the polindes
Poor road conditions (rocky, steep, and slippery in the event of rain), lack of transportation, and a lack of electricity make it more difficult for midwives to go out to the community or for the community to go to the midwife
Occasionally, a midwife must make house calls and be forced to “abandon” their assignment at the polindes
This is explained by a nurse who acts as a midwife in Hauteas village, North Biboki, TTU, NTT
“The fact that a midwife is not at the post does not mean that the midwife has left the village
But the size of the village and the number of patients that we must manage in various locations mean that we are sometimes not at the polindes.” Village midwife services generally involve prenatal checkups, delivery assistance, administering immunizations to infants, administering ”suntik sehat” (pain killer and vitamin injections) to women after delivery, controlling maternal and child health, providing information to mothers and prospective mothers about MCH, providing family planning services, treating malnutrition, and treating sick children
While conducting treatment, for instance administering immunizations, the midwife usually explains the immunization timetable to mothers
The entire village falls under the territory of the village midwife and polindes
Polindes services are limited to the hours between 07:00 and 14:00, but the midwives residing the village are usually on call 24 hours a day
There are posyandu in every village in West Java; they even exist in every hamlet
Almost all are active and well-managed by the posyandu cadres
Posyandu are the spearheads of MCH services at the community level managed by midwives together with the posyandu cadres (consisting of three to five people) 
services to note, weigh, measure, immunize, and provide information (often referred to as the “lima meja”, or “five-table”, services)
The normal process of posyandu activities will be disrupted if there are an insufficient number of cadres
This is the case in Tangkil village, Cirebon, which only has nine cadres who actively service six posyandu
As a result, two posyandu do not have any cadres, instead relying on a midwife and a puskesmas officer
To date, posyandu cadres play a highly central role, both in the provision of modern MCH services and in community life
They are usually active in various village activities together with the village head and village midwife
For communities, posyandu cadres are a source of knowledge and assistance related to maternal and child health
Posyandu cadres understand far more of the situation and real conditions of the community in the village and in their hamlet
The majority are women, except in NTT where there are large numbers of male posyandu cadres, for instance in Falas and Oenay villages in TTS
The posyandu cadres are the first to know who is pregnant, which family has under-fives, which under-fives have been immunized, what the nutritional status of under-fives is, where the people live, what the household size is, what the economic status of the household is, who is healthy and who is sick, and also who has children of primary—or junior high—school ages, or which child does not attend school
Unfortunately, village administrations do not fully appreciate the presence of posyandu cadres whose workload is heavy starting from servicing patients in the posyandu, observing community health conditions, and providing information to completing administrative tasks
This affects community members' willingness to become a posyandu cadre
Apart from the main cadre or the cadre leader, there is a high turnover among other posyandu cadres
In Susukan and Tangkil villages, Cirebon, for instance, many posyandu cadres had to leave their assignments due to economic needs; one of the alternatives is by becoming an overseas migrant worker after the monetary crisis
Since then, the posyandu in those villages are only managed by two or three posyandu cadres, less than what is required to meet the standard of a madya (medium) and mandiri (self- sufficient) posyandu
The lack of appreciation for posyandu cadres is not only reflected in the amount of incentives they are provided with—at most only Rp120,000 per year—but also by the training they receive
Although they have a central position in increasing the level of community health, not all cadres receive training
In fact, in various regions, no more than 25% of posyandu cadres have received training, as acknowledged by the head (male) of one Puskesmas in Kupang
Usually only the coordinating posyandu cadres receive training, both at the village and hamlet levels
It is expected that the trained coordinating cadres will pass their knowledge on to the other cadres who have not received training
The training provided to cadres is generally not standardized and differs in each region
Materials usually convered are related to the health of pregnant women or new mothers, the implementation of posyandu services, nutrition, immunizations and weighing, family planning, prevention of certain diseases such as vomiting and diarrhea, dengue fever, and malaria, and environmental health
Puskesmas are unpopular in NTT due to the obstacle of physical accesss
Although there are puskesmas in every subdistrict, they are not too popular for communities in the majority of rural areas in NTT
Distant puskesmas (3–15 kilometers away) will only be accessed in very urgent situations, for example, if a person needs treatment with more comprehensive facilities or because the midwife referred them to the puskesmas
There are also some hamlets, however, that are closer to the puskesmas in a neighboring village than to the polindes in their local village
3.1.2 Modern MCH Facilities and Infrastructure Although midwives have provided health services to the community with the equipment that is available, the equipment is felt to be lacking
In general, the village midwife possesses a “midwife kit”, infusion equipment, and a blood pressure monitor
A midwife (Rancakalong, Sumedang, West Java) states that she “feels that the equipment for either private practice or in the posyandu are currently inadequate, that is, there is no laboratory, no modern equipment for detecting the heart beat, and still many more.” 
Village midwives in urban areas have more comprehensive equipment, such as ultrasound equipment to monitor the condition of infants
Some polindes buildings are permanent and complete with a consultation room and a room where women who have just given birth can stay overnight
In fact, some midwives live at the polindes
Several polindes buildings have been built under community initiative other than through KDP activities
However, some polindes are still in temporary structures and do not have water or electricity
Based on observation, many posyandu in the sample areas do not have a permanent building
This is in accordance with the initial concept of posyandu that they belong to the community, so most of them are not housed in a permanent structure
Nevertheless, many community members wished for the posyandu to be housed in a permanent structure
Therefore, in several villages, permanent posyandu facilities are built by the community and in others, they are built through the KDP activities
Donor institutions also help to build health facilities, as is the case with Plan International which has erected midwife housing, polindes, and lopo for posyandu activities in several villages in NTT
3.1.3 Other Obstacles Faced and the Need for MCH Service Providers A lack of transportation is the main obstacle that village midwives, who must provide health service coverage over wide areas and in isolated areas, face
The situation is even worse where there are no basic facilities such as electricity
Midwives require a motor vehicle or another vehicle that can reach isolated areas on damaged and steep roads
The small number of village midwives compared to the size of the area they must cover results in a heavy workload for midwives
Workloads become even greater in areas with poor roads
Ideally, villages that cover a wide area and are isolated require more than one village midwife
Under existing conditions, there are village midwives that combine two posyandu or more in one posyandu session
Thus, the community in the distant and isolated areas must endure a long journey to attend the posyandu
As a result of the heavy workload due to the obstacle of physical access, village midwives in NTT are more reliant on income from delivery fee reimbursements from Askeskin (Asuransi Kesehatan Keluarga Miskin—Health Insurance for the Poor) or payments ranging between Rp50,000 and Rp100,000 per delivery from the community
The process of Askeskin fee reimbursal occasionally does not progress smoothly
For example, if the administrative details are incorrect (e.g., if the delivery date is incorrect), the insurance claim will not be reimbursed
Delivery fees in NTT are less than they are in West Java, where they range between Rp400,000 and Rp600,000
Because of the presence of private midwife practices, as is the case in West Java, it is difficult to differentiate between official working hours and private practice opening hours
This also makes it difficult for the community to differentiate between government and private fees, as the village midwife will often service a private patient in their house during official working hours
Unlike in West Java, in NTT village midwives do not conduct private practice
3.1.4 Cooperation with the Community and the Reach of Specific Groups The government still dominates efforts to proactively provide MCH services
With the exception of posyandu cadres, in general the entire community still become service users
They are not directly involved in decision-making processes related to service provision
Any increase in MCH services also are still highly dependant on the government and other service providers
Nevertheless, the level of community participation in assisting with the construction of health facilities is very high, as seen in NTT
polindes and midwife housing are generally built by villagers
Cooperation between MCH service providers and the community, including village officials and community figures, is generally very good
In fact, the community is highly supportive of and reliant on posyandu
In several areas, the community voluntarily decided to charge a fee of between Rp500 and Rp1,000 per service for the provision of supplementary food such as green bean porridge or other nutritious food
Community members are also willing to become posyandu cadres, even where there is no incentive or the incentive is negligible
In many areas, community members are prepared to walk for several kilometers to attend the posyandu services
Support from village officials and community figures towards modern MCH services is also great
Apart from providing information about the importance of MCH, they also visit the houses of community members who do not attend the posyandu activities
Village officials are also often present during posyandu activities
In several areas, village officials have also agreed to apply fines supported by village regulations
In Oehela village, TTS, for instance, a fine of Rp2,500 is applied for pregnant women or mothers of under-fives who do not attend the posyandu
In NTT, donor institutions have a fairly dominant role in urging the community to use MCH services
CARE has constructed nutrition rehabilitation posts in several villages, while Christian World Service (CWS) has provided supplementary food aid such as milk for pregnant women as well as vegetables, eggs, et cetera, apart from offering lessons on healthy cooking methods
CWS also provides de-worming treatment for children
In addition, World Food Programme (WFP) provides milk, sugar, cooking oil, and biscuits
In general, MCH service providers do not experience problems reaching specific community groups, including groups that to date use dukun beranak
However, they can experience difficulties when trying to reach at least three specific groups
(1) farmers who work in fields that are far from the settlements, (2) fishermen who sail to other regions, and (3) community groups that still follow the custom of se'i (see Box 1)
In Taunbaen village, TTU, at the end of the dry season, the community usually clears the land, which is usually located far from where they live, before planting it with food crops or commercial crops within a time frame of two months
Women in the later stages of pregnancy are still involved in these activities, so the village midwives cannot reach them as they are too far from the main settlement
This is also the case in Oehela village, TTU
Because there is no farming land in the village, the community generally buys or leases land outside the village which can be up to ten kilometers away from their houses
They build temporary houses on the land which they occupy during the land preparation and harvest seasons
making it difficult for village midwives to reach them
In Cirebon District, fishermen are often forced to look for fish outside their region
This is described by a coordinating midwife in Mundu, Cirebon, West Java, “When fishermen have to look for fish outside the region, they usually take their whole family
Thus, it is difficult for the health workers to ensure they are routinely checked.” In TTU and TTS districts, there are still groups who believe and practice the custom of se'i, as discussed by the head (male) of a puskesmas in TTS, NTT
Thus, the health workers are the ones who have to visit them.” 3.1.5 Traditional Services Although the number and function of dukun beranak are on the decline, they still exist, as outlined in Table 4
The table also indicates that in NTT, the number of dukun beranak is actually increasing
Some areas such as Insana and Kie subdistricts for trained dukun beranak and North Biboki for untrained dukun beranak
It is also astonishing that the number of untrained dukun beranak is actually increasing in urban areas (Alak and Maulaffa subdistricts)
In the majority of areas in West Java, with the exception of the isolated areas, the presence of dukun beranak and their role are steadily declining
In fact, their presence is shifting from being involved from the initial stages of the delivery process to only acting as an assistant for the midwife, having a greater role in caring for the mother and infant, or acting as a supplement to the service provided by the midwife
Several statements from informants are provided below
The paraji is only there as an assistant
(Men's FGD, Sukaratu, Darmaraja, Sumedang, West Java) There are still some [paraji] that use massage
(Men's FGD, Sukaratu, Darmaraja, Sumedang, West Java) An increasing number of the community use a midwife
Apart from the fact that there are no new paraji, it is also because midwives are safer, offer treatment with medicines, and more comprehensive equipment, such as a blood pressure monitor
(Village head in Darmaraja, Sumedang, West Java) The paraji are usually only for customary ceremonies, such as digeyong [swaying the baby to and fro] and things like that
There are also ceremonies for placenta burial that are also done by the paraji
(Men's FGD, Mundu Pesisir, Mundu, Cirebon, West Java) The presence of a government regulation that the delivery process is only to be performed by a midwife has had a role in the reduction of the role of dukun beranak
In Sumedang District, dukun beranak that assist with the delivery process must pay a fine, while in Susukan Subdistrict, the midwive will actually give money up to Rp25,000– 50,000 if the dukun beranak wants to work with the midwife to assist with the delivery
One dukun beranak in Darmaraja, Sumedang, West Java offered the following account
“In the past, each month there were three deliveries on average, but now after the regulation that we must give assistance with the midwife, it is rare.” From time to time, the amount of training that puskesmas provide for existing dukun beranak is cut back and nowadays, no training is provided for new dukun beranak
In NTT, dukun beranak—both women and men—are still involved during pregnancy, mainly for checkups and correcting the foetus's position, and in the delivery process
In Table 4, it is evident that the numbers of dukun beranak in several subdistricts have actually increased
This increase is due to the shortfall in the number of village midwives and the difficulties faced by village midwives in accessing residents living in isolated areas
Communication and cooperation between traditional (health) service providers and (modern) MCH service providers in the majority of sample areas are good
The Sumedang District Government's “Tri Mitra”, or “Three Partners”, policy has strengthened communication and cooperation between village midwives, dukun beranak, and posyandu cadres (see section 3.2.4)
The policy has also reduced competition between traditional health service providers and modern MCH service providers
In Cirebon District, dukun beranak are now involved in quarterly coordination meetings held at the puskesmas
Both village midwives and dukun beranak in Cirebon acknowledge that there is no competition between them
In NTT, dukun beranak have actually become posyandu cadres
3.2 Demand and the Factors Influencing Demand for Maternal and Child Health Services 3.2.1 Community Knowledge and Awareness of the Importance of Modern MCH Services In general, the majority of the community in the sample villages/kelurahan have good knowledge, understanding, and awareness of the importance of modern MCH services
Only in areas which are isolated and/or where a large number of the population is poor are there some community members who do not use modern MCH services
However, there are no communities who have never used modern MCH services
Among all of the modern MCH services available, the community would have at least accessed one or several of the services, as explained by a village midwife in Darmaraja, Sumedang
For pregnant women, it can be said that all of them have done health checkups routinely
During delivery, there indeed are still those who use paraji services; however, it is always asked that they always inform the midwife
While for postnatal, although there are still those who are helped by the paraji, they actually still have themselves checked by the midwife
During pregnancy and delivery, the majority of the community choose to be observed by the village midwife, and after birth, they again have themselves and their infants checked by the village midwife (see Appendices 13–15)
In discussions with groups of women and groups of men that are parents to under-fives, the village midwife often emerges as the first suggestion as the service provider used during pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum, followed by dukun beranak
In the majority of sample districts in West Java and NTT, there are no differences to the order of responses between isolated rural areas or rural areas with easy access, or even urban areas
This is reflected by the following statements from several FGD participants
If Midwife Eulis is not available, then we go to the puskesmas; but, Midwife Eulis is the main one
(Men's FGD, Sukaratu, Darmaraja, Sumedang, West Java) We always go to Midwife Tilde [a village midwife in Kuanek, TTU] because she is always ready, not only at the polindes during opening hours, but also at night if she is telephoned
Even when it is raining, we will go to the midwife because from her, we can get all the health services for mothers and babies here
It is the midwife who gives the injections, immunizations, and medicines, and teaches us how to look after a baby and how to breastfeed a baby
The midwife has done many good things
(Women's FGD, Kuanek, East Miomaffo, TTU, NTT) Nevertheless, in Nagarawangi village, Sumedang; Jagapura Kidul village, Cirebon; Falas village, TTS; and Kelurahan Fatufetto, Kupang, dukun beranak or paraji emerge as the first service provider during delivery
Dukun beranak also emerge as the first choice for providing postpartum services in the following villages
Neglasari and Buahdua in Sumedang, Jagapura Kidul and Mundu Pesisir in Cirebon, Falas in TTS, and Naikolan in Kupang
After delivery, the community in NTT do not generally use dukun beranak, unlike in West Java
A man from Mundu Pesisir village, Mundu, Cirebon, West Java confirms
“Yes
It is like this, Sir
If you go to Ibu Dede, you are also helped by Ibu Ayu
But, it is like this at the house, Midwife Dede and Bu Ayu only monitor
So, after that you get helped by Mbo' Kunah until puput (placenta comes out), until digeyong, and the customary ceremony.” (Men's FGD) Community choice of location to receive village midwife services can differentiate West Java and NTT
In West Java, during pregnancy, the community tends to have their health checks done at the home or private practice of the village midwife, at the posyandu, or in the puskesmas
During delivery, they go to the midwife practice or call the midwife to their house
In NTT, the community is heavily reliant on posyandu and polindes for routine pregnancy checks
During delivery, they also rely on the polindes or call the village midwife to their house
Community dependency on polindes in NTT is so high because they are always open and ready to service the community each day, while in West Java, they are only open once or twice each week
The community bases their choice of the village midwife on their knowledge that the midwife's services will be medically sound
So, the community is more likely to choose the village midwife because they can attend risky deliveries, they possess comprehensive equipment and medicines, they can provide “suntik sehat”, and can write referrals to the hospital, besides their being concerned about their first child being handled by the dukun beranak
Other reasons for choosing the village midwife are that delivery fees can be paid in installments even though they are relatively expensive when compared with the delivery fees for a dukun beranak; they are scared of being fined; they are scared that if they do not deliver with the village midwife, the midwife will not provide any more health checks; and they can obtain other facilities like birth certificates, baby items, and ear piercing for girls
The following several statements provide an overview
In the case of hypertension or a risky pregnancy, the midwife can handle it
She handles it faster
The midwife also gives “suntik sehat” after the mother gives birth
(Women's FGD, Susukan, Susukan, Cirebon, West Java) The midwife has comprehensive equipment
She has infusion equipment, blood pressure monitor, injections, medicines, scales for infants
The midwife also provides a room in the polindes for mothers who have just given birth
(Women's FGD, Kuanek, East Miomaffo, TTU, NTT) The delivery fees with the midwife are actually more expensive, but luckily, they can be paid in installments
You can just defer payment if you don't have any money
(Men's FGD, Sukaratu, Darmaraja, Sumedang, West Java) You can deliver with Rp350,000 with the midwife, including the birth certificate
(Women's FGD, Neglasari, Darmaraja, Sumedang, West Java) If you don't use the midwife, then later the midwife will be angry
(Men's FGD, Hauteas, North Biboki, TTU, NTT) I'm scared to not give birth with the midwife; later, if anything happens, for instance if the child is sick, the midwife will not want to check it
(Women's FGD, Oehela, Batu Putih, TTS, NTT) The majority of the community have had their children immunized with the help of the village midwife
Immunizations are mostly done at the posyandu (see Appendix 16)
High community awareness of the need to immunize their child is evident as generally, when mothers cannot take their child to the posyandu or when they miss the scheduled session for their child's immunization, they will take the child to the nearest polindes or puskesmas
In fact, in West Java, they go to the midwife practice for their immunizations
Several fathers also had knowledge about immunizations, even knowing the number and type of immunizations that their child is given
Below are observations by several community members
All children are immunized at the posyandu
There is BCG, hepatitis, polio, and measles
(Women's FGD, Taunbaen, North Biboki, TTU, NTT) Basically, children must be fully immunized until they are complete
If the immunization schedule is fixed, everyone attends except for children that are sick
(Men's FGD, Gegesik Kulon, Gegesik, Cirebon, West Java) Nevertheless, there are still a minority of under-fives who were not initially immunized because their parents were concerned that their children would run a temperature after being immunized and it would trouble the parents
In cases like this, the village midwife or posyandu cadre will make an effort for the child to be immunized by picking up the child and parent from their house and taking them to the posyandu
In several areas, the hamlet head involved himself by picking up the mothers so that they could attend the posyandu to immunize their child
Concern over possible side effects from immunization is reflected in the following statements
There are certainly children who are not immunized due to fears that they will run a high temperature after being immunized
Moreover, after watching TV that there are some who have died and become paralyzed after being immunized, there are some community members who are scared
(Women's FGD, Jagapura Kidul, Gegesik, Cirebon, West Java) [Parents are] scared that their child will get a temperature; then, later that night, they will be fussy and cry after the injection
(Men's FGD, Tangkil, Susukan, Cirebon, West Java) Community knowledge and awareness of the importance of weighing infants and children are good and the majority of the community use the posyandu for this service (see Appendix 17)
Financially well-off urban residents, such as some of the residents in Kupang City, take their children to an obstetrician to be weighed and immunized
All children are weighed at the posyandu or polindes
We want to know if a child is malnourished or not
(Women's FGD, Kuanek, East Miomaffo, TTU, NTT) Children are weighed at the posyandu and their weight is recorded in a book by the cadre
(Men's FGD, Bojongloa, Buahdua, Sumedang, West Java) Community awareness about malnutrition prevention and nutritional treatment is good
The majority of the community obtained their knowledge about nutrition from the posyandu and the village midwife
In the majority of posyandu, the community in fact voluntarily pay a fee for supplementary food to be provided
The community also knows that when an under-five is undernourished, the child will be treated at a designated puskesmas or will be directly referred to the district hospital (see Appendix 18)
Usually a cadre or the midwife will send children who have reached the red line or are underweight to the puskesmas
The child gets milk for several months so that their weight will increase
Bapak Kuwu [the village head] also occasionally gives food in the village office; the women cook it
(Women's FGD, Susukan, Susukan, Cirebon, West Java) If there is a malnourished child here, then the midwife will provide vitamins
The cadres also give food
Or, the parents are told to take the child to the puskesmas or to Soe where there is a place that receives malnourished children
(Men's FGD, Oenay, Kie, TTS, NTT) Although community knowledge about nutrition in NTT is fairly good, financial limitations cause them to be unable to provide sufficient nutritious food to their children
It is evident that there are still quite large numbers of undernourished, malnourished, and severely malnourished children in each village, between 10 and 40 cases, clearly indicating that there are problems in fulfilling nutritional requirements
In addition, the large amount of assistance in the form of formula, rice, and eggs for undernourished children means that some mothers are inclined to let their child become undernourished and that they are “pleased” if their child is categorized as undernourished, as has occurred in Oenenu village and parts of North Biboki, TTU
I see that the number of undernourished children in this subdistrict tends to increase
In my opinion, the obstacles surround the low awareness of mothers to pay attention to their children's food and it is evident that there is a tendency that where there is a lot of assistance for undernourished childrenmothers are inclined to let their child become undernourished in order to receive assistance
(Puskesmas head (female), TTU, NTT) The additional nutritious food for children [at the posyandu] is not free
Our economy is weak so we have to pay
It's difficult
(Men's FGD, Oehela, Batu Putih, TTS, NTT) We are not satisfied because only malnourished children receive assistance
My child won the healthy child competition, so we don't get anything
Let alone, the mothers that often get assistance are jealous of those who don't get assistance
(Women's FGD, Oenenu, East Miomaffo, TTU, NTT) Posyandu are the spearheads of modern MCH services for the community; however, it is clear that in the majority of sample areas, community interest in posyandu is lacking
This is indicated by the community posyandu attendance levels that are still below target
Based on observation at several posyandu, community attendance levels range from 29%–95%
In urban areas, attendance levels are even lower (Table 5)
In NTT, as posyandu are the mainstay for MCH services, attendance levels are higher
A posyandu cadre comments on posyandu attendance
“Basically, everyone has been to the posyandu, but attendance at each activity only ranges around 50% of the total listed under-fives” (Posyandu cadre, Jagapura Kidul, Gegesik, Cirebon, West Java)
There are several reasons why the community does not use posyandu services, including that 
(1) the child is scared to go on the scales, 
(2) there is a belief that the scales are wrong, 
(3) the child is sick,
(4) they do not want to because their children's immunizations are complete (for children above three years), 
(5) no supplementary food is being provided, 
(6) the location is not interesting or there is no children's play area (Bojongloa, Sumedang), 
(7) they are usually picked up by the posyandu cadre or a village official, 
(5) they are busy working or otherwise busy (e.g., trading at the market, at sea, or harvesting), 
(6) there is no one to take the child (e.g., the mother is a migrant worker and the grandmother is considered to be too old and unable to go to the posyandu), 
(7) there is a false perception that there is no relationship between weighing under-fives and health, 
(8) they are embarrassed to go the posyandu because of having too many (more than five) children and giving birth over the age of 45 (Mundu Pesisir, Cirebon), and 
(9) road conditions are poor or the river cannot be crossed during the rainy season
The following several statements reflect the above findings
When the posyandu is scheduled, the women are selling cloth at Tegal Gubung
They are more concerned about looking for money
Others are lazy
They have been invited, but they don't want to attend, although it has already been announced by the RW head through the mobile loudspeaker
(Women's FGD, Susukan, Susukan, Cirebon, West Java) I don't want to go to the posyandu
My child's weight is not increasing … Maybe the scales are wrong
What's more is that if there is no supplementary food, only half of the patients attend
It's different if there is food; it's full, with a queue
(Women's FGD, Bojongloa, Buahdua, Sumedang, West Java) The parents consider their children to be healthy, so they don't need to be weighed
It [the weight] is irrelevant
(Men's FGD, Jagapura Kidul, Gegesik, Cirebon, West Java) Usually if mothers don't take their children to the posyandu, it is because they have to walk a long way or because of the rainy season and floods, which definitely make it harder
If they are harvesting or busy planting or clearing the grass, then they also won't come to the posyandu
(Men's FGD, Falas, Kie, TTS, NTT) Although community knowledge and awareness of modern MCH services are good and the majority of the community have used modern MCH services, some community members still only use a dukun beranak
In addition, some women only give birth with the assistance from their husband, parents, or other family members, while others want to be assisted by the dukun beranak when delivering with the village midwife
One man from Sukaratu village, Darmaraja, Sumedang, West Java states, “Some [women] still deliver with the paraji, but they are always assisted by the midwife.” (Men's FGD) 
It is explained above that the community already has an adequate understanding of various modern MCH services, such as safe delivery, immunization, weighing infants, nutritious food, breastfeeding, and family planning
It is not surprising that the community obtains most of their information about various health services from the village midwife and posyandu cadres as they can be accessed almost every day
The community also receives information from the puskesmas, doctors, and, specifically for family planning, the family planning officer
A significant number of community members also obtain information from the television, newspapers, books, posters, or pamphlets
Village officials, PKK women, family, neighbors, or friends also contribute to the spread of information about various MCH services although this is not as effective in disseminating information as the other channels mentioned above
From the many sources of information listed above, midwives are placed as the primary source of information that the community can trust
Posyandu cadres hold the second position, followed by doctors
The amount of trust that the community has in the midwife is clearly understandable as the midwife faithfully takes care of and pays attention to their health from time to time, as well as because midwives are formal health officials
The community obtains information from the above actors when they see them for medical needs or during various formal and informal meetings
However, the community has not obtained information from a socialization program deliberately planned to disseminate information about modern MCH services
3.2.2 Obstacles to Physical and Financial Accesses Isolation (difficult physical access) is the main obstacle for the community in accessing modern MCH services and thus they do not use modern MCH services
Isolation is caused by several factors
(1) a great distance to the modern MCH service location, poor road conditions, steep roads, no bridges for river crossings, and forest passes; 
(2) a lack of transportation or high transportation costs (Rp8,000–Rp40,000 per trip); 
(3) no electricity making the road dark and vulnerable to robbery; 
(4) lack of a village midwife; and 
(5) the community's only reliance on posyandu or pusling, or puskesmas officers who are in fact not always present
These conditions are conveyed in the following statements
The midwife is too far away [about 4 kilometers], and there are thieves in the evening
This makes us scared to go there at night
The road to get there is also really bad
You feel like you want to die if you have to go there
Apart from that, the community has to cross a river that does not have a bridge, and so during the rainy season, they automatically cannot cross [the river] and reach the health facilities
(Men's FGD, Hauteas, North Biboki, TTU, NTT) The road to the puskesmas or health facilities has to be good
With the average economic condition of the community being low, combined with long distances and poor road conditions, particularly in the rainy season where the road is usually muddy and they have to cross a river with no bridge, in moments like this, occasionally, they have to take the attitude to not use the available health facilities
(Puskesmas head (female), TTU, NTT) A great distance means that women about to give birth are unable to wait for the midwife to arrive; it's even worse if the midwife is not available when needed
This means that the majority of women are more inclined to choose the dukun beranak
Apart from physical obstacles, financial obstacles, such as the expense of delivery fees, and the need to work far from the settlement are also major obstacles to the use of modern MCH services
In several sample villages, this is mainly caused by the high delivery fees set by the village midwife when compared to the cost of a dukun beranak
Village midwife delivery fees are Rp400,000–600,000 in West Java and Rp50,000– 100,000 in NTT, while dukun beranak charge a maximum fee of Rp100,000 in West Java and Rp50,000 in NTT for their services
If they are helped by a midwife, they do not know what and how much to give
So, it is just better to go to a dukun [beranak], so that the fee is negotiable
(Village midwife, Oehela, Batu Putih, TTS) Reasons for using a dukun beranak's services
because of the problem of fees
If you use a dukun beranak, it is cheaper
Maybe it's also because of the trust factor
(Men's FGD, Jagapura Kidul, Gegesik, Cirebon, West Java) In the Darmaraja Subdistrict region, there are still mothers who use the dukun beranak service for the reason that the fees are relatively cheap, at only half of the midwife's service fees, and the dukun's services are usually given in a longer time
(Puskesmas head (male), Sumedang, West Java) Those who don't deliver with the midwife don't have the fees and it is far from their house
(Men's FGD, Mundu Pesisir, Mundu, Cirebon, West Java) These fees are indeed high when compared to the incomes of farm laborers or other heavy laborers, or fishermen
To demonstrate, a fisherman's income in Cirebon is based on the season and during several months of the year, they often do not go to sea due to the west seasonal wind, while farm laborers may only receive Rp20,000 per day
While delivery fees in NTT are relatively cheap compared to the national measures, the local communities feel that the fees are terribly expensive, considering their low economic ability and infertile land conditions in a large number of villages as described by one village head in Batu Putih, TTS
“If you are born in Oehela, it is as if you have gone straight to hell.” The introduction of Askeskin did not immediately make the community turn to modern MCH services because it does not actually cover all poor families and is only valid for the birth of the first child, while many poor community groups have more than one child
In fact, in several areas, some have many children (in the coastal areas in Cirebon District)
The following statement depicts these conditions
Usually those who cannot afford to go to the midwife or puskesmas are the poorest, but they don't have an Askeskin card
There are a fair number of them because only 141 [of the total of 391] household heads have Askeskin cards
Sure they can get free service as long as they have arranged for an SKTM to be made, but it seems that not many of them want to arrange it
In some parts of Sumedang District, apart from the positive aim of the “Tri Mitra” policy, according to the community, the fees for deliveries handled by the midwife together with a dukun beranak and a posyandu cadre have become more expensive
In the past, if they only used midwife services, they only paid the midwife, but now they must also expend additional fees of approximately Rp100,000 for the dukun beranak and for the posyandu cadre (usually taken from the midwive's fee)
Farming activities that are far from home make it difficult for community members to access modern MCH services, particularly in TTU and TTS
In an area such as Taunbaen village, TTU, at the end of the dry season, the locals usually clear land which is far from their homes, before planting it with food crops or commercial crops over a period of two months
Women in the late stages of pregnancy are still involved in these activities
When they give birth, they are unable to return to their home or to be taken to the village midwife or polindes, so women frequently deliver in the field only assisted by their husband or a dukun beranak that can be called immediately
In Oehela village, Batu Putih, TTU, because there is no farming land in the village, the community generally buys or rents land located up to 10 kilometers away from their house in the village
They build temporary houses on the land which they occupy during the land preparation and harvest seasons
If they need health services, for example if a woman is in labor or if a child has a fever, they have no other choice but to call a dukun beranak or only rely on their husband to help them deliver
A woman from Oehela village, Batu Putih, TTS, NTT shared her account
“I used the dukun [beranak] because when I gave birth, I was in the house in the field and it was raining
My husband called the dukun [beranak] to help me.” (Women's FGD) 
3.2.3 Quality of Modern MCH Services It is of course the case that community choices for MCH facilities are also influenced by the performance of the service, which can be measured by the level of community satisfaction
For the community, a measure of satisfaction and good service quality is friendly attitude towards patients, low fees and the option of installments for the less-well-off, good and clean facilities (location), a queue that is not too long, effective medicine, the ability to provide 24- hour service if needed, and comprehensive facilities
Based on these criteria, Table 6 presents community satisfaction levels towards modern MCH services
Communities are generally satisfied with the services provided by the village midwife and polindes
The reasons that they give include that the village midwives can help the delivery process, the patient does not feel pain after given an injection, there is comprehensive equipment (infusions, blood pressure monitor, suction pump for amniotic fluid), the village midwives can refer patients to the puskesmas or hospital if there is a problem, they can treat sick children, they are able to give good quality medicine, they give sincere and honest services, they are patient and willing to wait until morning, and they are thorough and caring
Communities also like it that they can pay the fees in installments
These feelings are reflected in the following statements
Midwife Yuliana is happy to come at whatever time if she is called
She services us 24 hours a day, and she will even come to our hamlet which is so far
(Women's FGD, Mundu Pesisir, Mundu, Cirebon, West Java) Dissatisfaction to village midwife services is often related to the character of the midwife in question, the ineffectiveness of the medicine they provide, the midwife's lack of experience, difficulties reaching the midwife, and the midwife's not being always available
The community is not satisfied if the midwife is impatient or unfriendly
When a woman is in labor, she usually requires patience and friendliness
In addition, some midwives who are generally younger than the dukun beranak are also considered to be lacking the experience
Almost all communities are satisfied with the services provided by posyandu cadres
Apart from being satisfied with their weighing of infants and cooking for children at the posyandu, the community also consider posyandu cadres to be capable of giving information and care, actively informing the residents, or collecting them to take them to posyandu activities
In Sekon village, Insana, NTT, the community is often dissappointed with the services of puskesmas officers who do not attend posyandu services as this means that immunizations must be postponed until the posyandu session scheduled for the next month
The community is also dissapointed when the puskesmas officers often come late
Some sections of the community are dissatisfied with the MCH service facilities outside the village, particularly puskesmas and referral hospitals
This is related to the character of service providers (not thorough, unfriendly), the long queues, the feeling that Askeskin beneficiaries are often demeaned, the medicine that is ineffective, and the same medicine being provided for different illnesses
Several examples are listed below
I'm less than satisfied because they are not thorough, unfriendly, and sometimes rude
(Men's FGD, Sukaratu, Darmaraja, Sumedang, West Java) In the past, we paid at the puskesmas
Now, it is free, but sometimes they make safety net beneficiaries sometimes feel demeaned
(Men's FGD, Sukaratu, Darmaraja, Sumedang, West Java) I'm quite dissappointed as in the past when I was hemorrhaging, I was admitted but I had to have cash first before I was attended to
(Men's FGD, Sukaratu, Darmaraja, Sumedang, West Java) Yes, we have to be patient
It's good, though
Only, because there are so many patients, you have to queue
The puskesmas is full
(Women's FGD, Sukaratu, Darmaraja, Sumedang, West Java) Unresponsive
(Men's FGD, Sukaratu, Darmaraja, Sumedang, West Java) Nevertheless, another section of the community is satisfied with puskesmas services because the patients are well cared for and given the appropriate medication for their illness and there are doctors that can give checkups
Some community members are satisfied with pustu services (Kelurahan Fatufetto, Kupang), which are mostly available and are accessed by urban communities, while others are dissatisfied (Kelurahan Naikolan)
The main reasons for the dissatisfaction are that the medical equiment is uncomprehensive, there is a rude official, and often, there are no officers attending the pustu
The various sentiments are reflected in the below statements
We are not ignored
The service is fast
1
There is no midwife in the village
In several areas, the community is sometimes forced to use the dukun beranak because the midwife is often not in the village as they may not want to live in the village, they happen to be visiting their parents in the city, or look after their family who do not live in the village
When my third child was born, I was assisted by the dukun [beranak] because the midwife was not at the post at the time
(Women's FGD, Oehela, Batu Putih, TTS, NTT) The fees are cheaper
(Women's FGD, Mundu Pesisir, Mundu, Cirebon, West Java) 2
Embarrassment
Community members may be embarrassed because they have many children, or husbands may not want another person to see their wife's genitals
3
Trust and traditional beliefs
The community trusts and believes in the choice that their parents made to use the dukun beranak, to the point where it becomes the norm
4
The midwife often does not have the same skills and experience as those of the dukun beranak
Dukun beranak are usually older and considered to have more live experience than the midwife
This means that patients feel that they can ask the dukun beranak about many things and that dukun beranak can provide guidance to new mothers about such things as breastfeeding, bathing their child, and other traditional health issues
The fact is that after the 1980s, there were many dukun beranak who were well-trained
Knowing this, the community's concern about the professionalism of the dukun beranak lessens and hence, they choose to use the dukun beranak
5
“A mother's touch.” 
The community considers that dukun beranak have a mother's touch and can position themselves as a “substitute” mother who is patient, able to calm down the mother, able to massage and rub, and able to service intensively and routinely
Customary ceremonies
Dukun beranak help with traditional ceremonies, such as ceremonies for fourth and seventh months of pregnancy, as well as the ceremony held on the fortieth day after the birth
They are also prepared to bury the placenta (in West Java)
A woman from Jagapura Kidul, Gegesik, Cirebon, West Java explains that a “dukun beranak can also massage the mother for the first 40 days after the birth
The midwife only checks the mother and infant two or three times in the first week
After that, the dukun beranak has that role” (Women's FGD)
7
Blood relative
If a community member is related by blood to the dukun beranak, they are more likely to trust them and to not feel shy, and the fee will be very low
If the foetus is positioned correctly and an uncomplicated birth is expected, the community just uses the dukun beranak
This is supported by the following statements
If it is expected that the infant's birth will not be difficult, yes, it's good enough to use the dukun beranak
(Women's FGD, Jagapura Kidul, Gegesik, Cirebon, West Java) My wife goes to the dukun [beranak] first
If the dukun is incapable, then we'll just go to the midwife; let alone, now a paraji also has to cooperate with a midwife
(Men's FGD, Mundu Pesisir, Mundu, Cirebon, West Java) 9
Dukun beranak can correct the position of a foetus in breach position with massage
Feelings of exhaustion and pain after delivery can go after being massaged by a dukun beranak
10
It is believed that dukun beranak can give physical and supernnatural powers by reading prayers and by chanting mantras for the patient to feel calm and safe
“Usually the mothers still need a dukun beranak to attend the birth because they will feel calmer and the dukun [beranak] can usually chant while spraying betel nut onto the mother's belly” (head of a subdistrict, TTU, NTT)
11
Dukun beranak can raise the position of the mother's uterus through massage after delivery
12
Dukun beranak do not give women perineal sutures after delivery
Community members are often scared that perineal tears from childbirth will be sutured
In contrast to midwives, who are sometimes required to suture a women's perineum after tears, dukun beranak do not suture
In NTT, they heal the tears through se'i
13
Dukun beranak are prepared to follow a women's request related to their preferred birthing position
lying down, squatting, or standing
Related to this, the village midwife in East Miomaffo, TTU, NTT explained that midwives are recommended to follow women's requests for delivery position as long as it does not endanger the mother or infant
This recommendation is called “gerakan sayang ibu”, literally meaning “care for mother movement”
14
Belief and trust in the tradition of se'i in TTU and TTS
Se'i is done to restore the health of women after delivery and to heal wounds in the genital area
Aside from the pros and cons of using dukun beranak, dukun beranak have an important role in NTT considering the limititations to modern MCH services in the province, especially midwives
Trained dukun beranak always make an effort to communicate with village midwives
In urgent situations, they will accompany a patient while waiting for the midwife to arrive
And if necessary, they will assist with the delivery process
Later, they will remind the patient to have their health conditions monitored by the midwife
In communities in West Java, although there are traditional beliefs related to women's prenatal and postnatal health and delivery practices (see Appendix 19), the beliefs do not influence their use of modern MCH services
Actually, some no longer believe in or follow the traditional practices
In various discussions on the matter, it emerged that the community is aware of the importance of nutrition during pregnancy and after delivery, as well as the importance of exercise and physical activity, particularly when nearing labor
Other mores that have the potential for impeding the function of midwives are the belief that the husband alone should assist with the delivery of the first child and the taboo for a man's wife's genitals to be seen by another person
This is the case in Taunbaen village, North Biboki, TTU, NTT
In such cases, the village midwife attempts to explain that a midwife is necessary to help with the delivery process and does not attempt to prevent the husband or other family members from being present
3.2.5 Actors that Influence Demand for Modern MCH Services The role of the local government
The good community knowledge and awareness of the importance of MCH services are partly due to concerted efforts by the local governments at the district/city, subdistrict, and village levels to encourage the community to use modern MCH services
The Sumedang District Government, for instance, developed the “Tri Mitra” program in an effort to embrace paraji and communities still using their services
The program delegates prenatal and delivery care tasks and functions between midwives, paraji, and posyandu cadres
Policy implementation is strengthened by pangloh, or fines, for those who do not involve one of the three service providers during the delivery process
Although they do not have a clear understanding of the amount of the fine (according to the local puskesmas head, it is only Rp50,000, but some community members believe it to be as much as in the millions of rupiah), the community has become more inclined to use midwives rather than dukun beranak
Sumedang District Government has also established a policy to make puskesmas services free, which has also attracted community interest in the services, including the puskesmas MCH services
The community is not yet satisfied with the policy's implementation, criticizing the long queues and stating that the same medicine is offered for all kinds of illness
However, the policy has broadened community access to modern MCH services
The development of Desa Siaga is another policy; for example, in Pamekaran village, the village officials have started to collect a fee of Rp1,000 per family for assistance funds for complicated deliveries
In Cirebon District, the local government has applied a policy for institutional development at the village level; in fact, in several villages, these institutions go down to the RT level
For example, in Jagapura Kidul, Gegesik Subdistrict, there is a village health center, or Pusat Kesehatan Desa (PKD), that runs every Thursday, while in Kelurahan Mundu Pesisir, there is a health clinic, or balai pengobatan (BP)
Paraji are also involved in routine quarterly puskesmas meetings and in Cirebon District, preparations are also now underway to form Desa Siaga
The role of village officials
Village officials should be the most influential actors in raising community awareness of the importance of MCH
Nevertheless, their activities and roles vary between villages, leading to differing awareness levels between villages
As an example, the Sumedang District Government's policies are well-implemented at the village level
In Cirebon District, the role of village officials varies
Village heads, hamlet heads, and posyandu cadres always monitor who has not yet obtained MCH services
They always make themselves available to visit posyandu and see that polindes are in place
There are even several village heads who have organized their residents to build a polindes and a simple house for the midwife
Village officials also issue fines of Rp2,500–Rp5,000 to community members who do not attend the posyandu
It is not yet clear whether community awareness of the importance of attending posyandu is a result of a real understanding of the importance of MCH services or simply a matter of attending in order to avoid being fined
However, when the community experiences the benefits, eventually a real understanding should emerge
The women in several sample villages acknowldeged that they always make the effort to go to the posyandu because if they do not, they will be fined or will upset the midwife
The role of health workers at the village level
Posyandu cadres are highly active in urging the community to go to the posyandu and, together with the midwife, explain the importance of MCH services
Posyandu cadres are a source of information about MCH and help and information about general health, as acknowledged by FGD participants
As previously mentioned, posyandu cadres hold a central position in urging the community to use modern MCH services
Role of religious figures and tokoh adat (experts in local customs)
The role that religious figures and tokoh adat play in pushing the community to use MCH services cannot be overlooked
In West Java, kiai are central community figures and often influence their followers to use health services in various sermons or teachings
In fact, one kiai in Nagarawangi, Sumedang is the main figure in the “Clean and Healthy Rancakalong” movement
Of course, there are still some religious figures who do not support MCH programs, mainly on issues related to family planning
Their reasons for this are that the program contravenes the religious doctrine, but this problem does not emerge in the communities
Tokoh adat, particularly in NTT, also have a role in urging women to use particular MCH services
While their role is not too apparent because their number and significance are on the decline, in several areas such as North Biboki and Batu Putih, their role is clearly evident in the formulation of village regulations on fines for women who do not use MCH services
The role of family
At the community level, demand for MCH services is highly influenced by factors within the family
In West Java, decision making patterns for the use of modern MCH services are colored by groups of wives and supported by their husbands and parents or parents-in-law
Some parts of the community also admit that their decision to choose which type of MCH service they will use during their pregnancy or for delivery is the result of a joint agreement between husband and wife
In NTT, family actors, particularly the husband and extended family (parents, parents-in-law), play an important role in the decision for prenatal, delivery, and postnatal care
Of course, the family's decision is much influenced by their knowledge and awareness of modern MCH care 
that knowledge is also influenced by posyandu cadres, friends, and neighbors
Nevertheless, this kind of external influence is not always followed by increased awareness of the importance of modern MCH services
Such change also depends on poverty levels which are also tightly connected to education levels
As an example, Cirebon District, with a poverty rate of 16.6%, is poorer than Sumedang District, which has a poverty rate of 11.7% (BPS 2004 data)
This difference may help to explain why Sumedang has a higher level of demand for modern MCH services than Cirebon
Community social organizations and nongovernment organizations
In some areas, community social organizations are involved in MCH activities
During the research, in Sumedang, SMERU researchers came across women from the PKK who were active in ensuring the success of the MCH program through their assistance in the preparation of the Desa Siaga program at the village level
In efforts to ensure the success of endeavors to improve nutrition in NTT, since 2002, international organizations such as Care International and World Vision International have routinely provided food and milk aid to malnourished and severely malnourished children, particularly in Oenenu village, East Miomaffo
Aid from international organizations and the provision of supplementary food have apparently caused community members to “empoverish themselves” in order to receive assistance
The food is consumed by the entire family, whereas it is actually only intended for children suffering from undernutrition, malnutrition, and severe malnutrition
This problem is described by a midwife from Batu Putih, TTS, NTT
There was a supplementary food program for undernourished and malnourished children that lasted for 90 days
Residents were given packets of dried food
Here, if mothers are instructed to cook for their child, they think it is something that wastes time, consuming their work time
work in the plantation, the rice field, or wherever
So, we made the dried packets
Gave them eggs and formula
We have given information that each day a child must eat one egg
However, as it turned out, it wasn't just the child that was eating it, the whole household would share it
Formula was actually being drunk by the whole household
Problems associated with food assistance were also observed at one posyandu in Sekon village, TTU
At the time, the parents were quarreling because they considered that the milk distributed as supplementary food assistance was not evenly distributed
As it turned out, ineligible community members were actually receiving the milk assistance
IV
SUPPLY OF AND DEMAND FOR BASIC EDUCATION SERVICES According to the latest data gathered to assess Indonesia's performance towards achieving the MDGs in 2007, for the second goal of achieving universal basic education (UNDP-Bappenas 2007), several national indicators (NER–net enrollment rates, GER– gross enrollment rates, and literacy rates) are tending to improve (Table 7)
However, if seen from NER and GER for junior high school, many children aged 13–15 are not continuing their schooling to junior high school
The NER and GER for junior high school in NTT are lower than those in West Java
Other indicators that are used to determine achievements in the basic education sector are attrition levels, graduation levels, and repeat rates
Data from the UNDP-Bappenas (2007) shows that the proportion of students who completed primary school in the 1993/1994 academic year to the 1999/2000 academic year was 73% on average
This figure improves from year to year
however, change is occurring very slowly, 
As shown by the fact that the proportion of students who finished primary school from the 1999/2000 academic year to the 2005/2006 academic year averaged at 75%
While repeat rates have experienced a decline, the figures are still quite high
The attrition rates have increased between the 2001/2002 and the 2005/2006 academic years (Table 8)
From the above developments in the achievement indicators for the education sector, it is clear that there are still great challenges to be faced on both the supply and demand aspects
The following section will explain the conditions of supply of and demand for basic education facilities in a number of districts in the sample provinces
4.1 Supply and Coverage of Basic Education Services 4.1.1 Supply and School Capacity The positive impact from the government policy to build SD Inpres in all corners of the country is evident from the availability of state primary schools in most villages in Indonesia
However, this is not true for the majority of villages in NTT
As noted in Chapter 2, in West Java, each village, both rural and urban, has at least two to three state primary schools on average
However, in NTT, particularly in rural areas, each village has an average of one primary school, the majority of which are not state schools
Falas village in TTS, which is in a mountainous area with fairly difficult access, was the only village from the ten of the rural sample areas that had three state primary schools
Most primary schools in the majority of villages in NTT are private religious schools, dominated by Catholic primary schools
The others are SD GMIT (Gereja Masehi Indonesia Timur—Protestant Christian Churches in Eastern Indonesia)
As an example, of the six research areas in TTU, only Taunbaen village has a state primary school, namely the combined primary and junior high schools in Oenale
Quantitatively, the presence of one primary school in each village is considered to be sufficient
However, qualitatively, facilities for teaching and learning activities and school infrastructure in West Java are still insufficient and in fact, in NTT, the situation is more dire
In Cirebon, there are not enough classrooms in several primary schools, leading to the necessity for class exchanges between grade 1 and grade 2 or overcrowded classes in favorite schools
Apart from that, there are many classrooms that are in an unusable state, such as broken down ceilings and unmaintained school benches that put the comfort and safety of students at risk
Several primary schools do not have a library, or if they do, they are in a poor condition and do not have a comprehensive book selection, especially for textbooks
The same is true for visual aids and sporting equipment, which are not enough in each school
Whereas in West Java almost all primary school and junior high school buildings are permanent, the same cannot be said for NTT
In NTT, there are still many schools, particularly primary schools, which have thatched roofs, woven fibre walls, and dirt floors
These conditions were particularly evident in Hauteas village, North Biboki, TTU and Falas village, Kie, TTS
Unlike the number of primary schools, the number of junior high schools is still considered to be insufficient although the teaching and learning facilities and school infrastructure are better than for primary schools
State junior high schools are generally located in subdistrict capitals, both in West Java and NTT
In West Java, there are an average of more than three junior high schools (or equivalent) at the subdistrict level, while in NTT there are only an average of one or two
Great distances to junior high schools or their equivalent mean that they are unaccessible, leading to the need for schools that are closer to villages or a greater number of schools
Under normal situations, primary schools have sufficient capacities 
some primary schools in rural areas are even short of students
Problems emerge when the majority of the community living in urban areas choose one particular “favorite” primary school over the others that are available
Consequently, classrooms in the popular school become overcrowded, while the other schools experience a shortfall in student numbers
As an example, in Mundu Pesisir village, Mundu, Cirebon, the community tends to favor SDN (Sekolah Dasar Negeri) 3 (State Primary School 3)
Another example is that at SDN Gegesik Kulon 1 and 2 which are adjacent to each other in an urban area in Cirebon, more community members choose SDN 2
there are 70–80 students in grade 1 in one classroom
The community did not explicitly state their reasons for choosing the favorite primary school, but in discussions on satisfaction levels, it becomes clear that community choices are generally related to the quality of service that the school provides and the achievements that it has obtained
In addition, as a participant in one of the FGDs explained, she chose SDN 3, the favorite primary school in her village, because of “safety”, that is, students do not have to cross a busy road
“It is close to home, Ma'am
They don't have to cross
If they had to cross, I would be worried
It would be troublesome” (Women's FGD, Mundu Pesisir, Mundu, Cirebon, West Java)
Issues surrounding capacity also occur in rural areas that have primary schools in each hamlet
Due to distance, more people choose the primary school in the closest hamlet, while there may be a better primary school in another hamlet
Some schools have only 10–20 students, whereas according to the regulations, they could contain 35–40 students
The little ones are still accepted
In Cakrawati, there are three children who are still young and should still be in kindergarten
(Men's FGD, Sukaratu, Darmaraja, Sumedang, West Java) Here, there is a large capacity, but there are few applicants
(Men's FGD, Sukaratu, Darmaraja, Sumedang, West Java) The problem of limited school capacity also occurs in popular junior high schools
Although in several areas, there are junior high schools in villages other than the subdistrict capital, the community is generally more interested in the schools in the subdistrict capital
Apart from the status as a state school, another reason for this is that the school is popular, even though it is far away, even up to 5 kilometers
“Parents sometimes hope that their child will go to a favorite school,” said one father from Mundu Pesisir, Mundu, Cirebon, West Java (Men's FGD)
In order to overcome the problem of limited capacity, in several areas, school management has created enrollment criteria
For instance, age criteria for primary school students that exclude children below the age of seven years
Junior high schools that only receive students whose test scores are in accordance with the schools' standards
In the villages around Jagapura Kidul, the village administration has prevented students from going to the main junior high school in the subdistrict center and instead requires them to go to the new school they built so that the new school is not short of students
In almost all areas, children with mental disabilities are also refused enrollment in primary school
In NTT, the school also requires “birth certificates”, usually from church groups, to ensure the background of the parents of applicant students
If we reject some, it is because they do not fulfill the criteria
Enrollment criteria are that the child who is enrolled is of school age, that is, six or seven years old
The second is to have a birth certificate
The certificate does not have to come from the civil registrar, but the one from the church will do
Those who do not have a birth certificate are not instantly rejected, but are given the opportunity to make one first
Apart from the regular formal schools above, in several areas, there are still actually equivalency program schools like open schools and Kejar Paket A, B, and C
However, various interviews with the community revealed that the community is not particularly aware of the irregular schools and hence, these schools do not become an alternative for their children's education
Some also acknowledged pride (gengsi) if you had to educate a child at the alternative school
Currently, the provision of Kejar Paket B studies has stalled due to a lack of funding
This year's primary school graduates who did not go on to junior high school and enrolled in the Kejar Paket B program were yet to begin their studies at the time of the fieldwork
In NTT, for the past two years, governments and communities have made a concerted effort to overcome the issues of distance and isolation by building combined primary and junior high schools (SD-SMP Satu Atap, or SATAP) and “small primary schools” (SD Kecil)
The combined primary and junior high schools concept means that children who graduate from primary school can continue their education at the same location
This eliminates the problem of distance and physical access for the community
Almost all subdistricts in TTU and TTS now have a combined school
According to an officer from the education office, the effort will be made to develop a combined school in each subdistrict in NTT, particularly in the more remote subdistricts
No less important than the government's effort, communities' efforts have also been initiated to find a solution to the problem of access limitations by building small primary schools
“Small primary school”, or SD Kecil, is the term the local community uses to refer to a remote class of the main school
They are established in remote areas or areas with difficult access
However, unfortunately, such schools have only been established in Hauteas and Taunbaen villages
4.1.2 Obstacles that Schools Face in the Provision of Comprehensive Education Facilities The main obstacle faced by popular schools and schools that have a number of damaged classrooms is a lack of resources, in terms of both funding and human resources, to increase capacity and improve the school's physical condition
As they have no choice, a number of primary schools accommodate high numbers of students, exceeding their class capacity and resulting in disruptions to the learning process, a lack of concentration among students, and poor teacher supervision of students
Based on information from a school committee member in West Java, government funding is also limited, so the school committee must take special fundraising measures in order for school buildings to be improved
Schools with small numbers of students also often complain about lack of funding, as without such funding, they cannot provide satisfactory education services
Schools currently rely solely on the government, through BOS (bantuan operasional sekolah— Operational Assistance for Schools) funds, in order to meet facilities and infrastructure needs
With low student numbers, the school receives little BOS funds and hence is unable to provide standard teaching and learning activities
In addition, since BOS has been available, the understanding of free school has made it hard to ask the community to contribute to school funding
The BOS program does not automatically attract parents interest in sending their children, particularly, to junior high school as it does not cover associated school expenses, such as uniforms, transportation, and snack money
It has been acknowledged that there are still problems with school funding under the BOS program and that actually it is more difficult as funding contributions from communities tend to be lacking
To date, BOS funds are used to fund 12 components, including enrollment/accepting new students, stationeries procurements, teaching equipment, teachers' professional development, funding extracurricular activities, worship equipment, procurement of school furniture, and reporting
Another key obstacle for schools is a lack of teaching staff, particularly teachers for specific subjects
In West Java, the majority of teachers for both primary and junior high schools are civil servants, while in NTT the majority are nonpermanent teachers (guru honorer)
In some schools, as found in Oehela village, Batu Putih, TTS and Oenay village, Kie, TTS, there are only two civil servant teachers
This influences the level of teachers in class during teaching hours as well as teacher attendance levels
Schools in NTT generally suffer from a lack of teaching staff, some even not having a mathematics or science teacher, while primary schools in West Java have a shortage of English teachers for grades 4, 5, and 6
Susukan Subdistrict, Cirebon has only 35% of the required number of teachers and consequently, many schools need class teachers and teachers for religious studies and sport
To illustrate, only 5 of the subdistrict's 27 schools have a religious studies teacher and a sport teacher
In several schools, teacher stortages are handled by recruiting senior high school graduates or D2 (two-year diploma) students as nonpermanent teachers
Low teaching quality is another problem
The majority of teachers, particularly primary school teachers, do not hold a bachelor's degree
Moreover, many parents complained that often the teachers do not have good teaching capacities
To improve their teaching quality, as well as their prosperity, several teachers have received the opportunity to continue their education and become certified
However, teachers must fund these activities themselves
Several teachers have chosen not to undertake the certification process as they are approaching retirement age
They thus are reluctant to improve their education as for them, it is a waste of their funds
Besides this, some teachers, mainly in NTT, consider the certification requirements to be quite demanding and irrelevant to the education situation in their region
Other obstacles are the poor condition of school buildings (damaged or heavily damaged) and a lack of facilities and infrastructure such as books, art and sporting equipment, library, and laboratory
In several schools, the tables and chairs, and toilets are in an unacceptable state
Scarcity of clean water facilities is a separate obstacle
In certain seasons, schools rely on clean water from a well
But there are often no wells close to a school, so sanitation is lacking
In NTT, the lack of water means that students are actually asked to bring water to school each day to provide water for the toilets
An absense of administration staff in primary schools, unlike in junior high schools, means that teachers are also burdened with administration management
In schools with few students, perhaps this does not cause too great a problem
However, in schools with many students, for instance those with more than 400 (as is the case in SDN 2 Jagapura Kidul and SDN 3 Mundu Cirebon), administration becomes a large problem burdening teachers
4.1.3 Obstacles that Teachers Face in Providing Sufficient Services The main obstacle that teachers face is a continuously changing curriculum
When the 2004 Competency-based Curriculum replaced the 1994 curriculum and was still being adopted by teachers, it was again replaced with the 2006 curriculum 
This requires adaptation, particularly in getting a thorough command of the materials, and results in a greater workload for teachers
This is compounded when the application of a new curriculum is not followed by training for teachers
And in reality, almost no training is held for teachers due to a lack of funds; if training is provided, it is usually related to the implementation of a national program and only some teachers participate
A male teacher at one primary school in Gegesik, Cirebon, West Java describes
“Another problem that is also serious is curriculum change
These changes make it difficult because the current curriculum is difficult to apply in a school such as ours because there are so many limitations, like school capacity, teachers, students, and the parents themselves.” The low prosperity of teachers often means that teachers only teach because it is their job, not because they feel a “calling” to be an educator; as a result, they teach only a bare minimum amount of material
This is compounded by a lack of comprehensive facilities for maintaining teachers' health, mainly for nonpermanent teachers
The level of discipline in NTT amongst nonpermanent teachers is particularly low
caused by the appalingly low pay incentives which range around Rp100,000 to Rp150,000 per month
resulting in a lack of committment in their teaching
In addition, teachers' committment is worsened by the fact that they also have to look for additional income in order to fulfill their families' needs
Their wages are only around one hundred to one hundred and fifty thousand per month
That is certainly not enough
With wages such as that we also cannot fully reward their loyalty because they must fulfill their family needs
So, many teachers are absent as often as they please
In fact, some don't come for a week at a time
But, we also cannot hand out disciplinary punishment to them because they can go just like that and we won't have a teacher anymore.” 
These difficulties are even worsened by transportation obstacles as almost all teachers do not live in the village where they teach
There is even a teacher in Insana Subdistrict who lives in Kefamanu (the TTU District capital), which is 25 kilometers away from the school and lacks public transportation to the school or village
As a result of such obstacles, teachers are often late, in the rainy season sometimes arriving at the school at around 11:00 and only going to fill in the attendance sheet
Such issues have a poor influence on the quality of education services
It is a real dilemma that on one side, teachers must recover from falling behind as a result of the curriculum change and students' poor comprehension, while on the other side, they only have a limited education (only few have graduated from tertiary institutions) and do not have a sufficient level of prosperity
Although direct observation in the field showed that teachers usually live in a permanent housing of a higher standard than most and they may have a motorcycle, it appears that the teachers obtain these conditions by using credit facilities
It is easy for teachers to obtain credit as they only need the guarantee of their civil servant decree
As a portion of their wages are docked for credit repayments, most teachers only recieve a small amount of their monthly wage
In the end, teachers experience financial hardship and are unable to pay for their daily transportation to and from school
Teachers (and schools) also face low levels of parental awareness of and interest in their children's education
Parents are still inclined to grant their children's desires, leading to less than optimal study results
Parents also do not take interest in the lessons that their child receives at school or in ensuring that their children receive enough nutrients to concentrate through the day
Many parents still involve their child in family economic activities, mainly in the agricultural sector (during harvest time), fisheries (when at sea), and trade
Teachers also face problems related to students who find it difficult to follow their lessons
Apart from the frequently changing curriculum, a lack of proper nutrition means that students find it difficult to concentrate
To overcome this, in NTT, additional lessons are given in the afternoons, and even at night
In addition, teachers give additional remedial studies and tutoring for students who have fallen behind
In SDK Sekon, for instance, up to three teaching sessions are held each day
morning classes (07:00–13:00), afternoon classes (15:00–16:00), and evening classes (19:00–20:00)
A lack of teaching aids such as books, visual aids, and a laboratory compounds these difficulties
If in fact the facilities are available, the numbers are usually very limited and they are in poor condition or out of date
4.1.4 Obstacles in Reaching Specific Groups In general, schools do not experience problems in getting certain groups to send their children to primary school
However, this is not the case for junior high school
The specific groups in question are (1) fishermen, (2) poor households/ communities, (3) communities in isolated and remote areas, (4) communities that still revere the customs (adat), (5) those who do not see the benefit in education and who feel apathetic about their future, (6) parents of girls, and (7) disobedient or delinquent children
There are different reasons as to why these groups are difficult to reach
Fishing groups go to sea at certain times, taking their children
Poor households find it difficult to find the funds such as transportation costs, clothing, and money for snacks
Families living in isolated and remote areas face problems such as poor roads infrastructure and lack of transportation or high transportation costs
Communities that still revere the customs are difficult to reach if the child's involvement in school activities conflicts with their customary obligations or interests
For example, in NTT, if a girl goes to school outside the area and stays in a boarding house, unchaperoned, their bride price, or belis, will fall because their reputation will be tainted as a result of a presumption that she is not “pure” anymore
Those households or communities who cannot see the benefit in having an education are also difficult to reach
Relatively well-off households may not send their children to school
Such attitudes may be the result of not having a role model in their area who has become successful due to being educated
Apart from issues related to the customs, girls are also difficult to reach as gender bias is still in place, where people will prioritize education for boys
It is also very difficult to make delinquent children go to school due to the environment and lack of parental attention
They are more inclined to play than go to school
4.1.5 Service Quality Communities living in an area with only one school have no other choice but to send their child to that school even though its facilities and infrastructure are limited and the services are unsatisfactory
Perhaps because they have no other choice, it is difficult for the community to evaluate the quality of the school and its teachers
Because of this, usually, after a reasonably lengthy probing process, the community could finally express the criteria that determine the quality of a school
It was also difficult at first for them to express which criteria are important for a good teacher
It is not clear whether these difficulties were because the community did not usually have critical opinions or suggestions, because they were afraid, or because they did not actually know
The opinions regarding the qualities required for a good school and a good teacher are also explained in Appendix 20
According to community perceptions, the criteria of a good school are related to the school's environment and social activities, discipline of both teachers and students, academic achievements and achievements in other activities (sport, arts, Scouts), graduation rates, acceptance levels of graduating students in schools of the higher level, teachers' teaching and creative abilities, success level of graduates, school-teacher interaction, and the physical condition of school buildings and comprehensiveness of facilities and infrastructure
Criteria for a good teacher are related to their teaching abilities, having a good understanding of and ability to deliver the topics taught, teaching methods, discipline, attitude, and character (wise, kind, not leaving the class while classes are in progress, pious, and being a good role model for students)
Some parents are unconcerned about the quality of primary school as measured according to the above criteria as they choose a school not based on quality, but rather on location and safety
The majority of parents are satisfied with the quality of junior high schools
Based on their own evaluation of the quality of primary school teachers, some parents are unsatisfied as the teacher is often late, has a bad attitude (occasionally hitting students), cannot teach, and often leaves the class during class times
The majority of parents are unaware of the quality of junior high school teachers as the school is generally far from their home, while several parents suggested that the teachers cannot teach and are uncreative, bad-tempered (some even hit students), and often leave class
Several accounts are listed below
Several classes appeared to be empty, without a teacher, while several teachers were sitting in the teachers' room
In contrast to the direct observation, according to informants, teacher absenteeism is low, at less than 2 days per month
If a teacher is absent, it is usually because they are sick, attending refresher courses or training, or because of family requirements
Another cause for teacher absenteeism is living far from the school
4.1.6 The Role of Actors and Community Participation in Supplying School Facilities Since the BOS program has been in place, community participation in the supply of school facilities has fallen, but in isolated areas in NTT, community participation is still very high
Because the community in NTT is highly aware of the importance of school and the physical limitations to accessing school, some communities in NTT actively participate in the supply of education facilities and infrastructure
Through pure community initiative, many communities (such as Oehela, Falas, and Oenay villages in TTS and Oenenu and Kuanek villages in TTU) have built houses for the teachers
Some have also built all the school buildings themselves, such as the simple structures for the “small primary schools” (SD Kecil) in Hauteas and Taunbaen villages in TTU, while in Insana Subdistrict, TTU, they built a student boarding house
In the face of the high spirit of participation, some communities regret the prohibition of parent participation in school funding
But, having these BOS funds seems to have killed the committee's creativity
Among the conditions for BOS funds recipients is that schools are no longer permitted to request any kind of financial contribution from student guardians
Whereas in my opinion, parents should take responsibility for the physical improvement of schools
Because if they are not burdened by responsibility like now, they also do not feel like they are making a sacrifice, and so they do not highly “value” their children's education
If people make many sacrifices to obtain something then that something will become very valuable for them
(Village head in Batu Putih, TTS, NTT) Some village officials realize their role in helping to supply satisfactory school facilities by their involvement in meetings to discuss school budget plans (RAPBS—rencana anggaran pendapatan dan belanja sekolah) and in their joint fundraising efforts with the school committees to look for additional funds for school operational funding, mainly for schools whose low student numbers result in small allocations of BOS funds
Village officials are also involved in ensuring student attendance by (1) surveying school- aged children, (2) providing parents with information on the importance of school so that they send their children to school, (3) visiting parents who do not send their children to school, (4) explaining that school fees for the 9 years of basic education are now lighter under the BOS scheme, and (5) issuing SKTM so that parents can obtain discounts for school books and other expenses
To date, school committees contribute more to the provision of school facilities through the search for funds to the community rather than to the teaching and learning activities
The majority of school committee functions are solely conducted by the committee leader
The school committee leader is usually a community figure or a former school principal
Committee members are usually men and member numbers vary, with the majority of members consisting of community figures, parents of students, and teachers
In some areas, school committees have an indirect role in ensuring that children go to school by receiving inputs or complaints from parents, teachers, and the school
This feedback can help to monitor the implementation of education services in schools
In one case, a teacher was considered to be too harsh towards their students
The school committee reacted by informing the school management so that they would admonish the teacher in question over their teaching methods
Various informants gave explanations as to why the school committee was not active
The explanations included that the quality and commitment of committee members are low
Some also considered that BOS funds have had a direct impact on the activities of the school committee
This is a result of the committee's understanding that their task is only to look for additional funds for funding school development, that in the past, these fundraising efforts were directed towards parents
however, with the introduction of BOS, school management and school committees are prohibited from collecting any fees from the students' parents
A male FGD participant from Fatufetto, Alak, Kupang, NTT states that “the school committee does not exist anymore because we no longer pay school committee money.” Other explanations are that the institutional legitimacy of school committees is weak
The school principal receives a decree from the district head for their appointment, while the school committee only obtains the decree from the principal
In fact, structurally, the school committee is positioned on the same level as the principal, as is the case with the president and the House of Representatives
4.2 Demand for Basic Education Services and Factors that Influence Parents to Send Their Children to School 
In Neglasari village, Sumedang, schools are not willing to receive children under the age of seven years as they consider that children under that age are unable to follow the lessons
In contrast to the above, in Oehela and Boentuka villages, Batu Putih, TTS, many parents have sent their children even below the age of 6 years to primary school
This has occurred due to the lack of a kindergarten in the villages which accommodates children below the age of seven
One village head (male) from Batu Putih, TTS, NTT explains, “There is no school for children under school age as yet
Whereas the community here really wants to put their children into school
As can be seen in primary school, there are children who are only three or four years old, but they are already in grade one.” A minority of those who have enrolled in primary school do not end up completing their primary school education or withdraw from school, or after they complete primary school, they do not continue to junior high school, for various reasons
Not all children who have enrolled in junior high school can complete their education, simply discontinuing their studies
The occurrence of withdrawing from primary or junior high school or not continuing from primary school to junior high school is prevalent in all areas in varying numbers between regions (see Box 2)
The results of direct observation in several schools show that the number of primary school graduates is lower than the community estimates
As an example, Table 9 presents the development in number of enrolled and graduating students in SDK Sekon, Insana, TTU
The data indicates that not all students who enrolled in the primary school graduated (see the 1996/1997 cohort that should have graduated at the end of the 2001/2002 school year, or in June 2002)
Some of them may have not gone up to the next grade and/or withdrawn from school
The majority of students who have withdrawn from school or have not continued to junior high school now work
In Nagarawangi village, Rancakalong, Sumedang, many of them work in the small industry of making bags and furniture, while in Tangkil village, Susukan, Cirebon, they become laborers at the roof tile factories
In Bojongloa village, Buahdua, Sumedang, they choose to work as public transportation conductor, while in Jagapura Kidul village, Gegesik, Cirebon, they work as shoe polishers
In fact, some of the children have become beggars in Jakarta at the request/demands of their parents
In Mertasinga village, Gunung Jati, Cirebon, one girl who discontinued school when she was in the sixth grade became a migrant worker at the request of her parents
While the majority of children who withdraw from school or do not continue to junior high school work, some of them become unemployed
Apparently, some parents in certain areas in NTT are still not aware of the need to send their children to school
Some of them do not see the benefit and importance of school or they do not see that they can have a good future by being educated
A man from Hauteas village, North Biboki, TTU, NTT points out the common feelings of those who do not consider school important
The community in this region considers that one's life can only be improved if one's children become an official
Hence, a measure of one's success is becoming an official or a civil servant, or obtaining good employment
Unfortunately, in this research area, it is very rare to find a role model who has achieved their success as a result of their education
The majority of the community who have been to school in the region end up working in the same job as their parents, usually in agriculture or raising livestock, so the perception of going to school as an instrument to change one's destiny has foundered
Because of a lack of awareness, while some community members are willing to sacrifice several livestock for the requirements of a customary ceremony, they do not want to sell even one animal to pay for their children's school fees
They prioritize the customs over their child's education
This is the case in Insana Subdistrict
According to junior high school teachers, if a community member has a reduced number of cows, for example, to fund their children's education, they will feel that their wealth will be reduced and as a result, their reputation will be lost from the “customs”
This is in contrast to when they sacrifice a cow for customary ceremonies; while the number of their livestock is reduced, the loss will be made up in the “customs”
Still related to the customs, in North Biboki Subdistrict, TTU, a minority of parents do not want to send their daughters to junior high school as they are afraid that this will reduce their bride price (belis) value
Because the schools are far from the village, female students are forced to stay in a boarding house or dormitory, and their parents cannot chaperone them
To the parents, there is a risk that a girl's reputation will be tarnished if they live away from home
They may mix with boys in a nearby dormitory, or get a boyfriend, have sex, and possibly get pregnant, and so will no longer be considered to be “suci”, or “pure”, and thus their belis value will be reduced
4.2.2 Community Choice of and Access to Existing Schools In West Java, the existence of primary school facilities in almost every hamlet has enabled rural communities to send their children to school
For the majority of parents, school fees are the reason for selecting a specific school
Even though BOS generally covers tutition fees, the community still incurs other expenses such as transportation costs
In Buahdua village, Sumedang, for example, the village administration has suggested that residents send their child to the closest school, while in Mundu Pesisir village, Cirebon, parents choose primary schools with regard to their children's safety
According to one man from Buahdua, Buahdua, Sumedang, West Java, “The village has suggested that they send their children to the closest school.” 
The Buahdua village administration's decision for community members to send their child to the closest school is related to the very low number of students at some schools against their capacity
The success of the Family Planning program in Sumedang District has resulted in a fall in numbers of school-aged children in several villages
This has led to student numbers in several primary schools being lower than the school's actual capacity
According to the regulations, normal capacity per class is 40 students
However, one state primary school in Buahdua village has only 15 students per class
Similar numbers are found in all three state primary schools in Pamekaran village, Sumedang and in SDN 1 Jagapura Kidul, Cirebon
In fact, in Buahdua Subdistrict, which has had the most successful Family Planning program in all of Sumedang District, the junior high school with the highest number of students is still running under its maximum capacity
In addition, all the village administrations in Jagapura (Lor, Kidul, Kulon, and Wetan), Cirebon have adopted the policy that all junior high school-aged children in the four villages are required to go to SMPN 2 Jagapura due to its low student numbers
Because the majority of state junior high schools are in subdistrict centers or are outside the village, rural communities do not have a choice but to sent their child to the closest school, without consideration of school quality
This is not the case in regions with several schools, both in urban areas or in rural areas bordering cities
Apart from having far better access, these communities also have several choices
Both of these factors enable the community to begin to consider school quality rather than only distance and costs
However, as a result, better quality and popular schools may suffer from capacity limitations
A small number of those students who do not continue to junior high school are encouraged by officials or schools to take the Kejar Paket B program
However, there are still very few students interested in the Kejar Paket B program, and in several villages, it is not available
In Pamekaran village, Sumedang, as the school is still waiting for funding certainty, this year's Kejar Paket B program will not be running
As a result, this year's primary school graduates who have not enrolled in junior high school are adrift
Unlike in West Java, the limited supply of education facilities in several areas in NTT has implications for the communities' limited choice in schools
Parents do not have a choice and must send their child to the only primary school in their village
In urban areas, this is not always the case
In Kupang City, for example, there can be more than one state primary school in a village, so the community has a choice
Usually, they select the closest school
Interestingly, religious affiliation is also a consideration for parents when choosing a school for their child
This is the case in villages with more than one primary school with different religious affiliations, such as Boentuka village, Batu Putih, TTS
As explained by the village head, the village is dominated by Protestant Christians, who usually choose to send their children to SD Inpres Boentuka, while the Catholic parents usually send their children to SDK Yasuari, a Catholic school
For the junior high school level, in general, the community chooses the closest or popular school, both in urban and rural areas
For example, more choice is available in Insana Subdistrict, TTU, which has a state and a Protestant junior high school, but the community chooses the closest SMP, SMPN 2 Insana
In Susulaku village, the community prefers to choose the Protestant junior high school
It should be noted that ”closest” does not necessarily mean that the school is nearby
From most villages, it is roughly more than 4 kilometers to the nearest junior high schoo
But from others, such as Oenay village, Kie, TTS, it can be up to 10 kilometers
However, since combined schools (SD-SMP Satu Atap) and open schools (Kejar Paket B) have been established in several areas, conditions are changing for the better, to the point where some communities now have a choice
4.2.3 Physical and Financial Accesses Isolation is the main issue that rural communities complain about as it means that their children are unable to continue their education to junior high school or have no choice but to withdraw from school
Regional isolation is connected to great distance, unfavorable road conditions
poor road conditions, hilly conditions, and muddy roads during the wet season, and sometimes nonexistence of a bridge to cross the river; unavailability of a junior high school in the area, and a lack of transportation facilities
In NTT, children in rural areas sometimes have to cover a distance of 3–4 kilometers to reach their primary school; junior high school students have to travel even further
In Taunbaen village, North Biboki and Oenenu village, East Miomaffo (both in TTU), junior high school students have to travel more than 10 kilometers
Children in Susulaku village, Insana (also in TTU) are slightly better off as the closest junior high school is 4 kilometers away
In TTS, for instance in Oehela village, Batu Putih, and Oenay village, Kie, the students have to travel 4–5 kilometers
In urban areas, distance is not as much of a problem as transportation is widely available
However, in villages in NTT, sometimes great distances cannot be overcome as sufficient transportation facilities 
Thus, many school children must walk for 2–3 hours
This is a problem not only because it requires a great amount of the children's energy and time, but also because it reduces their enthusiasm for learning and leaving for school
Their concentration is also diminished after such a long journey, more so if they have not been provided with breakfast before leaving
Sometimes it also means that the children do not make it to school, truanting instead
If they do make the effort to go to class, they are afraid that the teacher will punish them for being late
In the end, the problem of distance cannot be separated from the problem of limited financial ability
Families of school children who are unable to walk for such long distances or face distances that are so great that walking takes too much time must provide the funds for transportation costs
Although the problem of distance has been seemingly overcome in several areas that have built a boarding house near the junior high school, this also creates its own problems; children are required to provide their own food and pay their boarding house rent, and the boarding houses can only accommodate a limited number of students
Limited financial access is the main reason for not continuing education to junior high school and for attrition
According to school management, poor families are received; in fact, in Sumedang, they are prioritized
BOS funding, which can be directed towards tuition fees, has enabled this
Nevertheless, families must still bear the burden of associated school expenses and daily family needs
Associated school expenses include transportation costs, purchasing books, LKS (lembar kerja siswa—students' exercise sheets), school equipment, uniforms, and snack money (see Box 4)
The economic prosperity or ability of a prospective student is not a criterion for acceptance to school, but when some poor families come up against such associated expenses, they withdraw their child from school
As an example, in several state junior high schools in Sumedang, prospective students are required to pay chair/building money, book money (LKS and some textbooks), and clothing money (uniforms, batik, sport uniform, muslim uniform) which in total range between Rp400,000 and Rp600,000
This is also the case in NTT
Mothers of children at one junior high school must pay no less than Rp700,000 at the start of the school year (see Box 4)
Parents' inability to fulfill such high associated education costs sometimes causes embarrassment for children and so they discontinue school
A small amount of BOS funding is kept aside to help less-well-off families to fulfill transportation costs, but in most cases, BOS funds are only enough to eliminate monthly tuition fees
The majority of BOS funds are used for school operational expenses, extracurricular student activities, and the wages of nonpermanent teaching staff
Assistance for poor children is only provided by parties external to the school, for instance foreign donors, such as the biscuits from the Australian Government for primary schools in Batu Putih Subdistrict, TTS; cash grants and scholarships for primary school and junior high school students in North Biboki from the Dutch Government; DBEP (Decentralized Basic Education Project) assistance for school construction and renovation in TTS; and aid from several international NGOs such as Plan International, CWS, WVI (World Vision International), and Care
A significant number of children are forced to help their parents earn money because of the family's poor financial situation
In NTT, children work as farmers helping in the field or rice paddy, herdspeople, motorcycle taxi operators, public transportation conductors, or peddlers
In West Java, children may also be required to work as fishermen or laborers (roof tile factory laborers, clothing factory laborers, domestic workers, shop assistants), migrant workers, traders and scavengers in Jakarta, or buskers
Some children who have been required to work discontinue their schooling as school time is taken over by work
Others may have felt the ”pleasure of money” and so lose the motivation to attend school
“Yes, there are [children who withdraw from school]
Usually, their parents take them to Jakarta
If they have already been to Jakarta, the child knows how it feels to have money, so yes, the child becomes unmotivated to go to school”
In NTT, some parents are not prepared to pay absentee fines their children have accumulated
The majority of districts in TTU and TTS issue fines for children who are absent
The fines vary among the regions
In Hauteas village, TTU, for instance, the fine is Rp1,000 for each day that the child is absent
If the fines accumulate and the parents cannot pay them, the child then becomes the victim and withdraws from school
4.2.4 Other Factors which Influence Primary School Graduates to Not Continue to Junior High School and Discontinue Their Education Apart from issues surrounding distance and financial access, other reasons why children do not extend their education to junior high school is that they do not want to go to school and they did not graduate from primary school
Attention must be given to reasons why children do not want to go to school
Apart from wanting to help their parents, for example by earning money, they also do not see that they can make a better future for themselves by extending their education
Besides factors such as lacking parental supervision, being undisciplined or disobedient, or being delinquent, they may also not want to go to school because it is difficult for them to retain the lessons, perhaps as a result of a low nutritional intake
Such conditions make it difficult for the children to progress to the next grade and can mean that they do not graduate
Juvenile delinquency appears to occur as a result of environmental influences such as associating with friends who do not attend school, playing computer games such as the Playstation, being persuaded by their friends, and getting little parental supervision
because there are a lot of influences
influence from their outside friends
(Women's FGD, Oenay, Kie, TTU, NTT) The motorcycle taxi driver persuaded them not to go to school
(Women's FGD, Hauteas, North Biboki, TTU, NTT) I've got one like that
Last year, he took Paket C but it was useless because of environmental influences
So, now he goes with the boats
(Men's FGD, Fatufetto, Alak, Kupang, NTT) If a child discontinues their education because the school refuses to admit them, it is usually related to the child's behavioral problems
Most cases are related to behavior leading to pregnancy or drug use
As a result, the child may be embarrassed to continue their education or be expelled by the school
Information provided by community members and school management shows that a significant proportion of attrition is caused by behavioral issues
School management and village administrations often attribute poor behavior to inadequate parental supervision as the parents are working
In any case, financial problems, parental supervision, and a child's behavioral issues are indeed interrelated, as reflected in the following statement
But, certainly you can't pin the blame on the children
They are only 6–12 years old and aren't yet able to understand the importance of school
Consequently, a lack of a child's desire actually reflects a lack of awareness and motivation from their parents for the child to get a good education
The parents' lack of motivation is caused by their being poor
So, instead of paying attention to their child's education, they are actually looking to earn a living for the family, and so not too much attention is paid to the children
A lack of parental supervision can be caused by the impact of divorce, the death of a parent, and as a result of entrusting the child to a relative who is unable to give the child full supervision
This is reflected in the following statements from informants
There is one whose father died, so they don't want to go to school
(Women's FGD, Kuanek, East Miomaffo, TTU, NTT) If the mother dies, the father usually remarries and he only takes care of the new wife, not paying attention to the children from the first wife
So, the children do not like to be with their parents again and more often choose to withdraw from school and look for work
(Women's FGD, Oenenu, East Miomaffo, TTU, NTT) As is the case in Jagapura Kidul village, Gegesik and Susukan village, Susukan (both in Cirebon), some community members work in far away places or become migrant workers, so they entrust their children to family members, who may not give their full attention to the child
In Mundu Pesisir village, where the majority of community members are fishermen, usually the parents and young children go on fishing expeditions outside the area, while school-aged children are left with a relative
In Susukan village, Kecamatan Susukan, Cirebon, many cases of attrition at the primary school level are as a result of parental divorce
Another example of combinations of lack of parental supervision and financial pressures are when a child leaves school to go with their parents when they are working outside the region (for example, going to trade in Jakarta)
In most cases, however, financial issues lead to poor nutrition as the family cannot afford to provide sufficient amounts of nutritious food
Financial limitations can mean that a child's diet is limited and does not vary, so children may be reluctant to eat
In addition, sometimes children have to leave for school before their parents have had a chance to prepare food
One teacher shares their experience in teaching children who are undernourished
Here we can only seriously teach until ten o'clock
even if you force it
They get tired
4.2.5 Irregular Attendance and Influential Factors 
The majority of students have never been absent from school for extended periods and have regular attendance, at both the primary school and junior high school levels
Nevertheless, short absences (less than 3 days) were prevalent in all areas for different reasons
Only in Tangkil village, Susukan, Cirebon, parents give their children permission to be absent during the harvest season (for a period of a week)
In this village, where the majority of community members work as farmers and farm laborers, the harvest season is considered to be a “blessing”, so parents allow their child to be absent from school to help
It can go for 3 to 7 days
They don't ask for permission because it is already the norm here
Illness is the main cause of absenteeism
Only a minority of students are absent from school due to financial reasons, with the exception of Tangkil village, Cirebon (see above)
Financial limitations often mean that parents cannot buy a spare uniform for their child
This can mean that a child truants if their only uniform is dirty or damaged
Sometimes parents are also unable to provide money for snacks, resulting in the child not going to school
If the uniform is torn, they don't want to go to school
There are children that ask for snack money
Sometimes students are absent if they have not completed their homework, as they are afraid of the teacher's reaction
“When they don't do their homework 
hey are afraid that the teacher will be angry 
A child not completing their homework or other assignments may be the reflection of a lack of parental supervision
It may also be as a result of a combination of lack of concentration, sleeping in, and behavioral issues
In urban areas such as Kupang, computer games such as the Playstation are quite disruptive for both primary school and junior high school students, often causing students to truant
In East Miomaffo, TTU, for instance, many students living in a boarding house or dormitory near the school skip school every Saturday as they need to go home to pick up food
School management does not issue sanctions for those students as food is a primary requirement for the children
Many children's houses are more than 10 kilometers from the junior high school, so girls usually stay in a boarding house
But, for boys there is no boarding house
So, they board in houses around the school
On Saturdays, they are often absent because they have to go home to pick up provisions
In NTT, customary celebrations and “market days” can cause students to be absent
Preparations are usually made for customary celebrations many days before the event and the community often works together to prepare for the festivities until late at night
In addition, as markets are difficult to access, weekly or monthly market days are an interesting attraction for village residents and their children
Some children are absent because of family matters, that is, because their parents have brought them along to attend family activities, or religious or customary activities, or because their parents have asked them to look after younger siblings while the parents work
There are also students who truant because they overslept, besides other reasons
Issues regarding the school and teachers can also lead to a student's reluctance to attend school
Insufficient or unsatisfactory facilities and infrastructure, poor or unstimulating teaching methods, teacher not setting a good example (often leaving class during lessons, admonishing students in an unacceptale manner, etc.), and the teacher often arriving late can all cause a student to lose their motivation to attend school
(Men's FGD, Oenenu, East Miomaffo, TTU, NTT) The teacher is mean
(Men's FGD, Naikolan, Maulaffa, Kupang, NTT) [Children are] not happy with particular lessons
(Women's FGD, Naikolan, Maulaffa, Kupang, NTT) Some parents employ several strategies to ensure that their child regularly attends school, reflecting community awareness of the importance of education
These strategies include asking their children about their activities at school when they come home, checking their homework and lessons, asking about their child to their friends or teachers, or taking the child directly to school
Below are some examples
Usually, their mother asks, ‘What were you studying earlier
Do you have homework or not?' (Men's FGD, Buahdua, Buahdua, Sumedang, West Java) [Parents] check their lessons
(Men's FGD, Buahdua, Buahdua, Sumedang, West Java) [Parents] monitor [their] children through the children's friends or teachers so that parents are not deceived
(Men's FGD, Buahdua, Buahdua, Sumedang, West Java) If the school is close, you can just check
(Men's FGD, Gegesik Kulon, Gegesik, Cirebon, West Java) [Parents] take them to school
(Women's FGD, Gegesik Kulon, Gegesik, Cirebon, West Java) 4.2.6 Actors at the Village Level that Influence the Community to Send Their Children to School In the family, the greatest initiative to attend school comes from the child themselves
Apart from support from parents, a child's desire to go to school is also influenced by their everyday environment
Most parents consider that it is their obligation to send their children to school, and so if the child does not want to go to school, parents feel that it is their responsibility to order or force their child to attend, to the point where they may use violence
there are also many cases where the initiative to go to school comes from the child themselves, who are also encouraged by their peers
At the primary school level, it is usually the parents who determine which school the child will attend
But at the junior high school level, usually the child determines which school they will attend usually because they want to go to the same school as their friends
Village officials in several villages also serve to encourage community understanding and awareness concerning sending their children to school
In West Java, this is particularly aimed at poor families by providing them with SKTM
In Tangkil village, Susukan, Cirebon, junior high school enrollments are directly managed by the school using BOS funding, while poor children who wish to continue to junior high school are directly received by the schools without undergoing an entrance test first like the children from other backgrounds
In the last teaching year, six children from one primary school in Tangkil village received an SKTM to continue to junior high school
The role and concern of village officials are also evident in Pamekaran village, Rancakalong, Sumedang
Village officials and the school committees are well aware of the number of primary school graduates and how many of them who are not continuing to the junior high school
In Buahdua village, Buahdua, Sumedang, the village administration cooperated with school management to establish the Posko Wajar Dikdas to process school-aged children by visiting the houses of parents of school-aged children 
In Darmaraja Subdistrict, Sumedang, the school management for one state junior high school has a policy to make visits to all the primary schools so that all primary school graduates can continue to the junior high school
extending the application period and seeking explanations for why a student is not continuing their education
In NTT, village regulations formalize encouragement from community leaders
In some villages, there are penalties under the customs that give fines to citizens who do not send their children to school
Apparently, the formulation of such regulations and fines are a local initiative to translate the national stipulation on compulsory education
The high level of school participation here can be caused by the stipulations we made that if there are children of school age who do not go to school, then their parents will be issued a sanction, that is, “Balek Tanah”, which is working on school land and then planting the plants that the school needs
This stipulation has been in effect since 2004
(Village head (male) in Batu Putih, TTS, NTT) Nevertheless, the researchers still came across village officials that do not play such a role
low levels of community awareness of the importance of educating their children or about the community's problems, making it difficult for community members to send their children to school
In contrast to the role of village officials, school committees in the majority of villages are still falling short in efforts to support or urge parents and the community to send children to school
It is suspected that some school committee members also do not yet fully understand the functions and roles of the school committee
Often, school committees only take part in fundraising for school development
Yes
(Women's FGD, Buahdua, Buahdua, Sumedang, West Java) The committee is a representative of the students' parents
They are usually assigned to fundraising, resolving problems
(Women's FGD, Tangkil, Susukan, Cirebon, West Java) The school committee's work is good, built the school, renovated it
(Women's FGD, Pamekaran, Rancakalong, Sumedang, West Java) The committee's function is indeed raising funds for school infrastructure
(Men's FGD, Sukaratu, Darmaraja, Sumedang, West Java) The school committee is comprised of students' parents who are trusted to allocate funds for school needs
(Women's FGD, Neglasari, Darmaraja, Sumedang, West Java) As the main function of school committees to date has been fundraising, since BOS funds have been available, many school committees are not fully operational except when signing off on RAPBS reports
Several schools still involve the school committee in the preparation of RAPBS reports and in school meetings with parents, both at the start and end of the year or at graduation
Nevertheless, in a few villages, school committees work together with parents and the school to resolve problems related to student learning activities
As an example, in Buahdua village, Buahdua, Sumedang, the game of dingdong (an arcade game that involves gambling) had entered the village
All the children were obsessed with the game and so did not go to school
In the end, parents, together with the school and school committee, created a rule to forbid children from playing the game
In several cases, school committees also have a role in accommodating the aspirations of parents and becoming intermediaries in disagreements between school management and parents
With relation to teaching and learning activities, the management of a school in Tangkil, Susukan, Cirebon involved the school committee in the preparation of the school's curriculum (KTSP) and teaching program
The school committee is also involved in monitoring teachers by disseminating the results of their monitoring to the principal or school supervisor
As is the case with school committees, other community members have a very minor role in the encouragement of parents to send their children to school
Some communities are reluctant to intervene if a parent does not send their child to school and only feel sorry for the children
According to the community, the Biboki and Insana regions have had a primary school since 1928 and a junior high school was established in the 1930s
While not many of the community have experienced education, at least memories about schools and other related issues have taken root in their minds
In addition, the dominance of the Catholic and Protestant religions, which are closely related to a tradition of formal education, have been quite influential
4.2.7 Other Actors that Influence the Community to Send Their Children to School The district/city government is the main provider of education facilities, both in West Java and NTT
However, they do not play a great role in encouraging parents to send their children to school
Compared to those in West Java, local governments in NTT play a more active role
Across levels of government, the subdistrict government has a greater role in encouraging, even forcing, parents to enroll their child in school than does the district government
The North Biboki Subdistrict Education Office, for example, in 2006 conducted an education campaign for the whole village designed to encourage the community to send their children to school
The subdistrict office head of North Biboki states, “In 2006, we held an education campaign in all the villages
It tried to increase awareness, while for problems with facilities, we can only make suggestions
In addition, the subdistrict head of East Miomaffo applied an inducement policy that involves issuing fines to parents who do not send their children to school
The subdistrict head of Insana even asked that people who are aware of a child who is not attending school report it to the subdistrict office for further processing by the police
Although in practice this has not occurred, the policy has resulted in an increase in the number of community members who send their children to school
NGOs, particularly international NGOs, and both unilateral and multilateral donor institutions also play a role in encouraging parents to send their children to school, but this was only found in NTT
WVI, for example, provides aid for both education and health in almost all regions in NTT through programs such as the Caring Parents (Orang Tua Asuh) program which is funded by a foreign donor (Canada)
This program not only provided financial support, but also moral support, so that parents would send their children to school
Certain donor countries also encourage parents or children to go to school
The Australian Government, for instance, provides supplementary food aid (such as biscuits) to children who attend the primary school in TTS
According to school management, attendance rates have increased since the supplementary food has been provided
For the last one year, we received aid [from Australia] in the form of biscuits
The biscuits were distributed each day to children
They liked them
And since we have distributed the biscuits the children are rarely absent
So, this is like a present for the children so that they will actually come to school each day
(Primary school teacher (female) in Batu Putih, TTS, NTT) The Government of Holland is another donor that urges parents to school their child by providing scholarships for children who are categorized as poor
It is hoped that the assistance will enable children who do not routinely attend school due to economic reasons to routinely attend school
V
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
5.1 Conclusion
Sample region characteristics that influence demand for modern MCH and basic education services 1
It is difficult to physically access the majority of villages in NTT and isolated and remote areas in West Java
In NTT, the majority of roads have rock-hardened surfaces, are steep, windy, and slippery and muddy when it rains
Several hamlets are separated by rivers that do not have bridge crossings and so cannot be crossed in the rainy season due to high water levels
Rural transportation facilities are almost nonexistent, with the exception of motorcycle taxis, which are relatively expensive by local standards
In West Java, several villages are relatively easy to access and have adequate public transportation facilities
Some villages have rural transportation (usually minibus) available and almost all villages have many motorcycle taxis
Nevertheless, the rural transportation does not reach several villages and isolated or remote hamlets
2
The main livelihoods of the majority of sample communities in NTT and West Java are farming and fishing
While West Java is relatively fertile, land in NTT tends to be rocky and infertile
Apart from tending cash crops like tamarind and raising livestock, farmers in NTT often rent or buy land outside the village for planting various varieties of seasonal crops
In doing so, the whole family, including pregnant women and school-aged children, usually leaves the village for several months
Particularly in coastal regions in West Java, fish shortages in fishing areas close to villages
fishermen must leave the village to go to sea with the whole family, including pregnant women and school-aged children, for a short period
3
In the majority of study villages in NTT, basic facilities such as electricity and water are very limited or unavailable
It is difficult for village communities in NTT to obtain clean water for household and agricultural needs and schools 
only villages close to subdistrict centers can access state electricity
Such conditions, compounded by poor road conditions and transportation facilities, mean that many village midwives and teachers are unwilling to live in their assigned village
In the majority of study villages in West Java, basic facilities are satisfactory, except in the coastal villages in Cirebon, which must purchase water for drinking and cooking needs
Why do some communities in Indonesia not use maternal and child health services
Supply 1
There are adequate numbers of modern MCH facilities in areas where physical access is not a problem, but in areas far from reach, these facilities are still lacking
Village midwives are the main providers of modern MCH services in all villages
In hard to reach or isolated areas in NTT, not all village midwives are willing to live in their assigned village due to the minimal level of basic facilities and/or because their family lives in another village
Consequently, the polindes can become inactive
2
Large working territories can mean that village midwives are unable to service all community members even if the midwife resides in the assigned village
In addition, the polindes is left unattended for long periods of time when a village midwife conducts house calls
Ideally, wide territories should have more than one village midwife
3
All villages, in fact all hamlets, have a posyandu
Most of them are active and routinely held each month, and each is well-managed by three to five cadres
Nevertheless, attendance levels for posyandu participants (pregnant women and under-fives) are still low
To date, posyandu cadres have been central to providing MCH services
In West Java, all posyandu cadres are women, while in NTT, there are many male cadres
4
Village midwives face their main obstacles in servicing the community when they try to reach certain groups, which are (1) those who are unaware or not particularly aware of the importance of MCH services, such as communities that still revere the customs
In NTT, this constitutes communities that still practice se'i, while in West Java, this may be communities where men do not want their wife's genitals to be seen by another person; (2) farming communities that work in fields far from the main settlement; and (3) fishing communities who go to sea far from the village
5
Other obstacles for village midwives include the absence of transportation facilities to help them cover their large territories and isolated areas, the small number of village midwives, and irregular incomes
In NTT, village midwives are more reliant on income from the reimbursement of delivery fees from Askeskin, which in reality are not that easy to claim, while in West Java, patients are occasionally late in paying their installments for midwife services
6
Although their numbers are declining, dukun beranak are still operating
Between one and five dukun beranak are operating in each research village/kelurahan
In West Java, their role in the delivery process is increasingly shifting from being involved in the delivery process to only becoming an assistant to the midwife and taking more of a role in caring for the birthing mother and infant
In NTT, while in general the community uses midwife services, in areas difficult for the village midwife to reach, dukun beranak are involved in prenatal care, mainly in checking and correcting the foetus's position, and in the delivery process
Demand 1
Communities choose to use a village midwife based on their knowledge that medically, midwives can be relied upon
For example, they can be trusted to assist with risky deliveries, they have comprehensive equipment and medical supplies, they can give “suntik sehat”, and they can provide referral letters to the hospital
In addition, people may choose to use a village midwife as they can pay the delivery fee in installments even though the fees are relatively expensive compared to those of a dukun beranak; they are afraid that they will be fined if they do not; afraid the midwife will not be willing to check them again if they do not deliver with the assistance of the village midwife; and they obtain additional services such as a birth certificate, a gift of baby equipment, and ear piercing for baby girls
2
Almost all children are immunized by the village midwife
However, some infants were not initially immunized usually because the parents were concerned that the infant would run a fever and would be fussy if they were immunized
Immunizations are mostly done at the posyandu
3
Although there is good community awareness about the importance of weighing infants and under-fives and most community members rely on posyandu, some still do not attend the posyandu
Reasons for this include that 
(1) the child does not want to go onto the scales;
(2) they believe that the scales are inaccurate; 
(3) the child is ill; 
(4) they are unmotivated as the child has been fully immunized (for children over 3 years), no supplementary food is being provided, the location is not stimulating for children or there is no play area, usually the posyandu cadre collects them to take them to the posyandu, or the road is muddy; 
(5) the guardian is busy working; for example, trading at the market, fishing at sea, or harvesting;
(6) no one is available to take the child, for instance, because the mother is abroad working as a migrant worker and the grandmother is considered to be too old and unable to go to the posyandu; 
(7) the false perception that a child's weight has no relation to health; 
(8) the mother is embarrassed to attend the posyandu because she has many children (more than 5) and gives birth over the age of 45 years; and 
(9) there is flooding, meaning that the river is uncrossable
Physical access limitations and isolation, economic access limitations, and belief in se'i in NTT are the main reasons why community members do not use modern MCH services for pre- and postnatal monitoring or for delivery
Isolation can be caused by great distances from modern MCH services; poor road conditions, including being difficult to pass and mountainous, having to cross a river without a bridge, or passing through forest; a lack of transportation facilities; a lack of basic facilities such as electricity, meaning that the road is dark and attracts thieves; and an unavailability of a village midwife
These factors can mean that community members rely on posyandu, pusling, or puskesmas officers who are not always available
Limited economic access is related to the high cost of delivery and transportation and can also lead to the need to work far from the main settlement
Moreover, women who are undergoing se'i cannot go out for 40 days and therefore the midwife is unable to access them
5
Other causes for non-use of modern MCH services include that (1) the midwife is not available; (2) mothers are embarrassed or ashamed due to having many children or husbands do not want their wife's genitals to be seen by another person; (3) there is a traditional belief in the use of dukun beranak services; (4) there is trust in the expertise of the dukun beranak
6
Service quality does not dissuade community members from using modern MCH services, but some community members are dissatisfied with midwife services
Dissatisfaction is often related to the midwife's character, ineffective medicine, minimal experience of the midwife, difficulties in reaching the midwife, and a midwife's absence from the post
7
Some community members use neither modern MCH services nor dukun beranak during delivery as they are assisted by the husband, close family, or neighbors
This is usually as a result of the infant being delivered before the village midwife or dukun beranak arrived
8
Actors at the village level that support the use of modern MCH services are village officials, village midwives, posyandu cadres, religious figures, neighbors, spouse, extended family (mother or mother-in-law), and tokoh adat
Why do some Indonesians not send their children to primary or junior high school or their equivalents
Supply 1
In terms of quantity, the existence of a primary school in each village is considered to be sufficient
However, from both the quantitative and qualitative sides, the facilities for teaching and learning activities and school infrastructure in West Java are still inadequate
The situation is more dire in NTT
In West Java, each village has two to three state primary schools, while on average, villages in NTT have only one primary school, the majority of which are private religious schools
Apart from having too few classes, many classrooms are no longer suitable to be used
the plasterboard ceiling is broken and school benches are unmaintained
Several primary schools do not have a library; if there is a library, conditions are poor and the book collection is lacking
This is also the case with visual aids and sporting equipment, which are still minimal
In NTT, there are still many schools, mainly primary schools, that only have thatched roofs, woven fibre walls, and dirt floors
2
In terms of quantity, there are too few junior high schools although the facilities for teaching and learning activities and school infrastructure are better than those in primary schools
State junior high schools are usually found in the subdistrict capital
In West Java, each subdistrict has more than three junior high schools, but in NTT, there are usually only one or two
The long distance makes junior high schools or the equivalent difficult to reach, leading to the need for schools that are closer to villages or a greater number of schools
3
Under normal conditions, primary schools have adequate capacities
Several rural primary schools even have student shortages
Problems emerge when the majority of the community living in urban areas with more than one primary school chooses a “favorite”, or popular, school
Similar problems are found in popular junior high schools as usually the community chooses to send their children to the junior high school in the subdistrict capital
4
In order to overcome capacity limitations, school managements in several regions have issued criteria for a student selection process
For instance, setting a minimum age requirement for primary school students, grade standards for prospective junior high school students, and in NTT in particular, schools also stipulate that students must have a birth certificate from the church to ensure the background of the prospective student
In almost all regions, children with mental disabilities are refused enrollment at primary school
5
To overcome the problems of distance and isolation, in the past two years, the government and communities in NTT have established combined primary and junior high schools in one location (SD-SMP Satu Atap) and “small primary schools”, or “SD Kecil” (a remote class of the main school)
6
The main obstacle that popular schools and schools with damaged classrooms face is a lack of funds and human resources, which are needed to increase their capacity
Since the BOS program has been in place, it has been difficult for schools to ask the community to contribute to school funding due to the understanding that BOS funds are to be used to make school free
7
Other obstacles that schools face are a lack of teaching staff, particularly teachers of specific subjects (such as mathematics and science teachers), and the low teaching quality of teaching staff
The majority of both primary school and junior high school teachers in West Java are civil servants
In NTT, the majority of teachers are nonpermanent staff
Some recruited as senior high school graduates or as D2 students
8
The main obstacles that teachers face are frequently-changing curriculums, a low parental supervision of their children's education and nutritional intake, as well as the difficulties that students have in absorbing their lessons
In addition, many parents still encourage their children to help with the family's economic activities, for example, during harvest time or when fishermen are at sea
9
Other obstacles that teachers face are the low prosperity level of teachers and the limited available transportation to isolated areas
Almost all teachers do not reside in the village in which they teach
In addition, teachers are also burdened by administrative tasks, as the majority of primary schools do not have administrative staff
10
In general, there are no obstacles to getting specific groups to send their children to primary school
However, this is not the case with the junior high school
Groups requiring special attention include (1) fishermen, (2) poor communities, (3) those living in isolated and remote areas, (4) communities that still revere the customs, (5) those who do not see the benefit in going to school and who do not see how going to school can benefit them in the future, (6) parents/guardians of girls, and (7) children with behavioral issues
11
Since schools have been receiving BOS funding, community participation in the provision of school facilities has tended to decline
This is not true for isolated areas in NTT, where high awareness of the importance of going to school and the existing barriers to physical access to school has led to active community participation in the provision of education facilities and infrastructure
12
In general, school committees at both the primary school and junior high school levels are not functioning to their full potential and generally only the committee leader has an active role
School committees are more involved in the provision of school facilities through fundraising efforts rather than in taking a role in the teaching and learning activities
Demand 1
Some parents in isolated areas in NTT are still not fully aware of the importance of sending their children to school
Some still cannot see the benefit of going to school or they cannot see that they can have a better future by going to school
These opinions are also often connected to the absence of a role model whose success is due to their education
2
Some communities in NTT also prioritize the customs and honor
They are willing to sell livestock for customary needs, but not for their children's school needs
A small number of parents do not send their female children to the junior high school as living unchaperoned in a boarding house may reduce the girl's bride price (belis) value
3
Problems related to physical access and financial access are the main reasons for attrition and are why some parents do not send their children to the junior high school
Physical access or isolation are connected to great distances between home and schools; roads that are in poor condition, hilly, and muddy, and have unbridged river crossings; a lack of junior high school facilities or equivalent nearby; and a lack of transportation facilities
4
Financial access problems are connected to the associated school costs and the cost of everyday family needs
Associated school costs include transportation costs, purchase of books, LKS, school equipment, uniforms, and snack money
Parents' inability to fulfill these high associated education expenses cause students to become embarrassed or ashamed, finally resulting in attrition
In addition, many children are forced to withdraw from school as they must help their parents earn a living by working
Financial access problems are also related to parents' inability to pay absenteeism fines that a child may have accumulated
While BOS can cover tuition fees, associated school expenses can be particularly burdensome for families
5
Another reason for attrition from the junior high school or for not continuing to the junior high school is that the child does not want to go to school
Children may instead choose to help their parents who may be experiencing financial difficulties by working or earning money and they cannot see how going to school will afford them a better future
This may also be due to an inability to retain lessons, possibly caused by a low nutritional intake, a lack of parental supervision, or behavioral issues
6
The majority of both primary school and junior high school students have never been absent from school for an extended period and attend school as per the regulations
Generally, if a child is absent from school, it is because of their suffering from an illness, having uncompleted homework, going home from the boarding house to pick up food for the following week (for junior high school students), or attending a customary ceremony, family matters, or a market day
7
Economic reasons also cause students to be absent
During harvest time, students who do not directly help their parents in the fields are usually required to look after younger siblings or leave the village with their parents when the parents are working
In addition, financial limitations may mean that parents are unable to purchase a spare or replacement uniform for their child
So the child may truant if their only uniform is dirty or damaged
8
Several reasons for students' being absent from school are related to school or teacher quality, including inadequate school facilities and infrastructure, unstimulating or boring teaching methods, the teacher's providing a poor example (for instance, the teacher often leaves class during lessons or has an inappropriate method of addressing or admonishing students), and the teacher's often being late to school
9
Actors at the village level who actively urge parents to send their children to school are village officials, school committees, and neighbors
Village officials may issue fines to parents who do not send their children to school, explain the importance of educating one's child to parents, and make an effort to ensure that children who do not attend junior high school participate in Paket B
School committees always attend school meetings with parents even though their role is more directed at fundraising
Neighbors usually contribute by reminding parents to send their children to school although the parents may be offended
5.2 Recommendations 1
Based on the above findings, at the very least, PNPM Generasi and PKH administrators should give attention to the following three main points
a
how both programs can respond to the main issues that frame why some people do not use modern MCH services and why some parents do not send their children to school; 
b
how the programs can reach specific groups, such as 1
communities living in isolated and remote areas; 2
the poor; 3
farming and fishing communities who work far away from their normal place of residence; 4
communities that usually use dukun beranak because of beliefs and traditions; 5
families with many children; 6
communities that prioritize the customs over the importance of school; 7
communities who do not see the benefit of going to school; 8
parents/guardians of girls; and 9
children with behavioral problems
c
how the programs can harness the participation of influential actors at the village level
2
Taking note of the data and information obtained in the field and the methodology used, researchers that conduct impact assessments and program evaluations need to pay attention to the following aspects
a
Researchers need to look deeper into specific topics, such as the policy of fines, various community initiatives, the role of institutions, dynamics in the relationship between officials and the community, community structure, social capital, the provision of supplementary food at posyandu and schools, locations where children absent from school congregate during school hours, and gender dimensions
b
Informants should not be limited to specific informants, depending on the needs and comprehensiveness of information obtained in the field (via snowballing method), so there are clarification and triangulation of information
c
In connection with point b above, informants at each level should not only be limited to specific informants
For example, at the subdistrict level, group interviews should be held with the subdistrict head and staff that handle or are knowledgeable about MCH services, basic education, and the village context
Then, at the village level, hamlet heads, section heads for villagers' welfare affairs, and others should be interviewed
d
Comprehensive evaluation methods must be determined as various aid programs have entered almost all areas in NTT
This may blur the impact being observed
Besides this, researchers should also be cautious when choosing control and treatment areas as some areas that are not receiving assistance according to the program regulations are in reality already receiving or have received some form of assistance
e
A longer period of time (at least 10 days) is needed to conduct field research in each village

ABSTRACT The Role of Social Protection Programs in Reducing the Impact of the Global Financial Crisis 2008/2009 The global financial crisis (GFC) 2008/09 has impacted on Indonesia's economy
In order to minimize the impact of the GFC, the Government of Indonesia issues several monetary and fiscal policies, besides continuing various social protection programs
This report is the outcome of research on the implementation of various social protection programs and their role in alleviating the impact of the crisis
The research is part of the activities under the Monitoring the Socioeconomic Impact of the GFC 2008/09 research that has been undertaken by SMERU since July 2009
This is a qualitative research project to draw a general picture of the impact of the crisis, the implementation of various social protection programs, and the role and benefit of these programs in overcoming the impact of the crisis as well as for community livelihoods
In general, the outcome of this research shows that the impact of the crisis is still continuing although the intensity is declining
Many government authorities, however, do not sufficiently understand conditions at the community level due to the absence of a tiered, periodic, and systematic information system on the socioeconomic condition of the community
One of the consequences is that the government has not taken any special measures for communities that have been affected by the crisis and has only maintained existing social protection programs with a standard regulatory mechanism or previous implementation mechanisms
In general, the role of various social protection programs in responding to the impact of the crisis has been relatively poor and varies across programs
Nevertheless, in the effort to reduce poverty, although it has been limited, the presence of social protection programs has had a positive benefit on communities, especially in fulfilling basic needs such as food, health, education, business costs, and the provision of infrastructure

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The global financial crisis (GFC) that hit the world in 2008/09 also had an impact on Indonesia's economy, although the impact was not as serious as the impact in other countries and was different to the impact of the economic crisis of 1997/98
In 1997/98, the domestic financial market was in a poor condition
This was evident from the high number of outstanding debts
However, demand for export goods remained high
In fact, the fall in the value of the rupiah at that time tended to benefit the export market
On the other hand, during the GFC 2008/09, the financial markets and Indonesia's economic fundamentals were relatively good, but demand for export goods tended to fall due to the weakening economies of advanced countries
In order to minimize the impact of the GFC, the government issued monetary and fiscal policies, while various social protection programs (program perlindungan sosial—PPS) continued operating
The preparation of effective policies need the support of a rapid monitoring
Since July 2009, The SMERU Research Institute, with the support of the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) and in cooperation with the National Development Planning Board (Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional—Bappenas), has been monitoring the socioeconomic impact of the GFC
This monitoring is conducted through four groups of activities
(i) news monitoring, (ii) community studies, (iii) quantitative analysis, and (iv) case studies
The case studies are conducted every four months and the first case study was conducted between August and November 2009
The objective of this qualitative study was to obtain a general picture of the impact of the crisis as well as the implementation, role, and benefits of the various social protection programs in overcoming the impact of the GFC and supporting community livelihoods
The social protection programs examined cover various central and regional government programs with an emphasis on the National Program for Rural Community Empowerment or PNPM (Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat) Mandiri Perdesaan
Field visits were undertaken in the main areas of export commodity production that had been relatively badly hit by the impact of the crisis, namely Kabupaten Musi Banyuasin (Muba) in the Province of South Sumatra as a rubber producing area and Kabupaten Banjar in the Province of South Kalimantan as a coal and rubber producing area
In each study district (kabupaten), two or three villages in one or two subdistricts (kecamatan) were visited
The Impact of the Global Financial Crisis In all study villages, the GFC had an impact on almost the entire community at various welfare levels because, in general, community livelihoods were associated with the rubber and coal commodities whose prices had experienced a dramatic fall as a consequence of the GFC
The price of rubber lump at the farm gate that was previously around Rp11,500 per kg slumped to approximately Rp2,500 per kg in October 2008 with the result that average community incomes fell sharply to less than one-fourth of their previous level
As a result, markets were quiet, the turnover of stalls (warung) and traders dropped, motorcycle loans defaulted and were repossessed by dealers, the quality of consumption declined, there were fewer snacks for children, and community social activities dropped off
Nevertheless, the seriousness of the impact of the GFC varied between community groups who were directly associated with rubber production businesses such as tappers, plantation owners, and intermediary traders
In general, tappers were the worst-affected group due to their limited incomes and savings
For other groups, savings or assets that they accrued when the price of rubber was high were still relatively able to maintain their welfare level
When the price of rubber was very low, various survival strategies emerged, especially amongst the rubber tappers, including
(i) becoming a worker in a palm oil factory; a sand mining worker, and a farm laborer; (ii) moving outside the province as far as Java; and (iii) selling assets
In early 2009, the price of rubber started to creep up again
Although, at the present time, the price of rubber is still approximately 60% of the precrisis price, the community feels that their economic conditions have started to improve
On the other hand, the impact of the GFC on the coal mining community was not that extensive because there were still many mining companies that were able to survive
The price of coal that fell approximately 50% was still considered economically viable
However, several companies experienced falls in their sales volumes, so this had an impact on their workers
There was, however, little impact on workers because there were few retrenchments
Nonpermanent workers experienced a greater impact in the form of a decline in the volume of employment and the premiums that determined the income that they received
The impact of the GFC was then compounded by the enactment of the Regional (Gubernatorial) Regulation (Perda) of South Kalimantan Province No
3/2008 on Regulating the Use of Public and Special Roads for the Transport of Mining and Plantation Company Products dated July 23, 2009
This perda banned the transport of mining products and oil palm on public roads
As a result, hundreds of coal trucks that normally used the main road of Simpang Empat in the direction of the harbor in Banjarmasin could no longer operate
The ban had serious consequences for coal companies located near public roads, transport service providers, providers of land for stockpiling, mine workers (permanent and nonpermanent), workshops, tire repairers, food stalls, petrol pumps, and other associated businesses
The worst-affected group was mine workers, both permanent and nonpermanent workers
Those who were previously earning an average income of Rp1.5–6 million per month lost their jobs
Many of them then moved to other areas to work as farm workers or took their trucks outside the province to transport other commodities
Some of them returned to their previous employment as rubber farmers, either on land they owned or on land owned by other people
Some other workers do odd jobs or are still unemployed
The community can still feel the negative impact of GFC, although it tends to decline in intensity
Nevertheless, many government officials do not have an in-depth and comprehensive understanding as to what impact the crisis has on the community
This is primarily due to the nonexistence of a tiered, periodical, and systematic information system
The Implementation and Role of Social Protection Programs 
In general, the PNPM has a positive role in community welfare
However, it has had less impact in the effort to reduce the impact of the crisis
This is related to the strictness of the internal program mechanism and funding limitations
In the development of infrastructure, other factors such as limited employment opportunities created, the brevity of the implementation period, the slow process of fund disbursement, and the program not being implemented during the same time as the crisis contribute to the impact on the effectiveness of the PNPM's response
Nevertheless, infrastructure development has the potential to raise local economic activity through improving market access and the utilization of 40% of the local material
Infrastructure development contributes to the building/improvement of village roads, bridges, and clean water infrastructure
These developments benefit the community by making it easier and faster to travel to the plantation, markets, and health and education facilities
Nevertheless, this study found infrastructure that could not be used because it was inferior in quality due to poor maintenance
In addition, there are cases of development projects that were undertaken by the contractor without any community involvement
There were also quite a lot of activities that were not completed as planned, for reasons that included a time-consuming consultation process, slow funds disbursement, weather delays, and problems with the supply of raw materials
Women's savings and loan scheme (SPP) activities are felt to be more helpful in alleviating the impact of the crisis because funds were disbursed when the crisis first started
SPP activities also have a role in developing economic activities although the number of borrowers and the volume of funds are limited
Through the SPP activities, the PNPM also provides low-interest loans
In general, borrowers use the funds to add capital to businesses that are already operating or to open new businesses
However, the tendency for borrowers to come from the nonpoor has an impact of the significance of the benefit from the PNPM for the poor who have been most affected by the crisis
PNPM activities have been fully determined by the community through a long competitive process
Nevertheless, there have been cases where kecamatan administrations intervened to allocate activities to the whole villages to prevent the emergence of intervillage jealousies
In addition, there are villages that have not submitted proposals for PNPM activities because the process is too long, there is no one prepared to manage it, or the previous year's proposals were not accepted
The number of villages that do not submit proposals for activities is estimated to increase because there has been a fall in the budget from Rp3 billion to Rp900 million per kecamatan in 2009
The lack of a program information board in all villages and the low level of community awareness about activity funding indicate a less than optimal level of program transparency and accountability at the community level
However, determining the activities through an intervillage consultative process (MAD) is acknowledged to be an effective means of encouraging community participation in the development process
Rice for Poor Households (Beras untuk Rumah Tangga Miskin—Raskin)
Until now, Raskin rice distribution managers at the village level have, in practice, been able to adjust the program's implementation to local requirements, although not in accordance with regulations, for example in determining targets, the selling price, and the amount of rice per household
Such practices should be able to be utilized to respond to the impact of the crisis, but implementing authorities do not use them
Nevertheless, Raskin is generally quite helpful in alleviating the cost of living
This role is increasingly clear when the price of rice rises, the supply of rice in the market is disrupted, and in times of famine or when the harvest fails
The distribution of Raskin rice to households varies between RT and villages
In some places, an equal share is given to everyone who is interested and others prioritize poor households, so there is no guarantee of targeting accurately
In addition, not all poor households receive Raskin rice each month
Many of them only receive the rice two to four times per year because there is no money, it is during the rice harvest season, they are unaware that the Raskin rice has arrived, or there is no distribution each month
They buy Raskin rice for Rp2,000–Rp3,000 per kg according to the distance from the distribution point (kecamatan office) to the allocation point
This price is higher than the stipulated price of Rp1,600 per kg at the distribution point, but it is still cheaper than the market price that ranges from Rp4,000 to Rp6,500 per kg
Education
School Operational Assistance (Bantuan Operasional Sekolah—BOS), Free Schooling Program (Program Sekolah Gratis), and Regional Education Operational Assistance Program (Program Bantuan Operasional Pendidikan Daerah—BOPD)
Education programs can lighten the burden on the community, especially for the poor during crisis
The motivation of the community to send their children to school rises, so cases of children dropping out of school are rarely found
Many villagers admit that if this program were not available, their children would probably only attend primary school
The impediments that the community is still frequently facing is the cost of transport to school
BOS, which is supported by the Free Schooling Program in Kabupaten Muba and BOPD in Kabupaten Banjar, has succeeded in providing a broader opportunity for children of school age to enjoy a free education service (primary to senior high school in Muba, primary to junior high school in Banjar)
Both kabupaten also provide scholarships to poor students and these scholarships are funded by the National Movement of Foster Parents (Gerakan Nasional Orang Tua Asuh—GNOTA) with Rp360,000/student/year
Health
Jamkesmas, Askes Semesta, and Jamkesda
The Jamkesmas program, which is supported by Askes Semesta in Kabupaten Muba and Jamkesda in Kabupaten Banjar, provides the certainty of health protection for the entire population
Those who have a local identity card can obtain basic health services at the puskesmas (community health center)
Free referral services at the hospital can be enjoyed by the entire population of Kabupaten Muba and by the poor population of Kabupaten Banjar
Because of the availability of free services, the number of patient visits to health facilities did not experience a fall during the crisis
Nevertheless, there are two important matters that need attention
Firstly, the poor generally still face the impediment of transport costs to attend a puskesmas or hospital
Secondly, the community considers that free health services are less than satisfactory
For that reason, many communities prefer to use medicine purchased from a neighborhood stall or the services of the nearest health worker/midwife although they have to pay for this service
Direct Cash Transfer (Bantuan Langsung Tunai—BLT)
The BLT program provides a clear benefit because it is in the form of cash assistance, some of the funds were disbursed during the crisis, and the majority of recipients were farm laborers who are the group most affected by crisis
In general, recipients utilize BLT funds for daily consumption
Some use the funds for medical treatment, school needs, or paying up debts
General complaints that are often made by authorities as well as program recipients relate to undercoverage due to limited allocations of BLT funds or a data collection process on poor households that is less than perfect
Communities receive BLT funds fully and without any deductions, but they have to spend up to Rp35,000 for the cost of transport to receive the funds at a post office
In several cases, recipients could give authority to collect the funds to village officials on their own initiative or the initiative of the village officials'
During 2009, for example, recipients in one RT were asked to give authority to collect the funds to the head of the RT by paying him the cost of transport of Rp15,000
Family of Hope Program (Program Keluarga Harapan—PKH)
Although the number of recipients is very limited, the implementation of the PKH in Kabupaten Banjar is considered to have been helpful for very poor households who are generally farm laborers and the most affected by the GFC
In general, target households use the PKH funds for health needs and the education of their children
Some households use some or all of the PKH funds to improve the quality of consumption by their family
At the kabupaten level, the data on very poor households in receipt of PKH funds has to be revalidated every time there is a disbursement of funds, so their number changes
During the second phase of funds disbursement in 2009, the number of target recipients declined 13.4% from the 4,991 very poor households in the first disbursement phase
This change occurred because some households no longer fulfilled program requirements
However, the validation was questionable because there were households who no longer fulfilled the requirements but still became PKH recipients
Loans for Small-scale Businesses (Kredit Usaha Rakyat—KUR)
The role of KUR has had little impact in alleviating the effects of the crisis because KUR funds are allocated to those who already own a business, which is generally not the group that is most affected
In addition, the role of KUR in the empowerment of micro and small businesses is very limited
Very few villagers in the sample villages know of, applied for, or obtained KUR loans because the socialization of the program is very limited
According to village authorities, KUR loan schemes are no different to commercial loan schemes and this is also a factor in the low level of community access to KUR funds
Other Programs/Assistance
The local government in the study kabupaten does not provide special assistance/programs to reduce the impact of the crisis
But some assistance has been provided by the local government and private sector since prior to the onset of the crisis
The government of Kabupaten Muba has provided death benefits and free services for the production of drivers' licenses (surat izin mengemudi—SIM), identity cards (kartu tanda penduduk—KTP), birth certificates, and the administration of first marriages
The government of Kabupaten Banjar has provided death benefits and free KTP services
In addition, since 2007, the local government in Kabupaten Banjar has operated a villageowned enterprise (badan usaha milik desa—BUMDes) at the kecamatan level to empower the rural community's economy
This BUMDes has the tasks of conducting business activities, such as a loan service for production inputs, provision of agricultural inputs, the development of livestock enterprises, marketing services for agricultural products, and other activities in accordance with the need and potential of the village
In two kecamatan visited, the BUMDes have not developed effectively because of the poor performance of their managers and the lack of interest in borrowing by the community
In Banjar, coal mining companies provide various assistance and compensation to the community in the vicinity of the mining location
Assistance is provided in the form of benefits for orphans and poor people, incentives for teachers paid by honorarium, contributions to the mosque, madrasa (Islamic boarding school), or school, and other activities
Compensation is provided in the form of “dust money” and village fees for households and village officials that are provided each month
Conclusions Although the impact of the GFC is still taking place in the community, many government officials do not understand what is really happening at the community level due to the lack of a tiered, periodic, and systematic information system
This results in further consequences, one of which is that the government at various levels has not planned or conducted any special action to help the affected community
Government officials keep carrying on operating the existing social protection programs by the book, just similar to the implementation in previous years
In the effort to reduce poverty, social protection programs provide a positive, albeit limited, benefit for the community, especially in fulfilling basic needs such as food, health, education, business expenses, and infrastructure development
In relation to the effort to reduce the negative impact of the GFC, the following are some of the findings
a) Apart from the existing social protection programs, the government has not provided any other programs as a special response to the crisis
b) There has been no attempt and plan by government authorities to adapt the PPS to response to the GFC
This is because
(i) authorities have an inadequate sense of the crisis; (ii) the PPS is planned as a poverty reduction program; and (iii) not all PPS provide the space for authorities to adapt them because the program implementation schedule and targets have already been pre-determined
c) Certain PPS such as PNPM and Raskin that could possibly be adapted by authorities have not been utilized to respond to the GFC
d) PPS have certain targets that tend to cover the poor, while the GFC has had an impact on the entire community which has various welfare levels
e) Programs with general targets (health and education) can assist the community that has been affected by the GFC
However, some community members are still unable to access them due to transport and administrative requirement problems
Recommendations a) In facing the crisis or socioeconomic fluctuations, there is a need to develop a crisis information system that is fast, on time, and accurate through news monitoring, the utilization of communication technology (quick count), and field surveys
This information system should involve various relevant stakeholders from the government and private sector, both at the center and in the regions
b) In the context of assisting community groups who have been affected by a socioeconomic shock such as the GFC, especially the poor or those who have fallen into poverty as a result of the GFC, the central and regional governments need to
(1) Create an umbrella legislation that allows for the legal modification of the implementation of existing social protection programs
in response to the impact of the socioeconomic shock or to recover from the impact of the shock
(2) Adapt the implementation mechanisms of
(a) PNPM
Simplify the phases of the process and disbursement of funds, if necessary, by using bailouts
(b) Raskin
Provide the authority to program managers at the village level to adapt the targets, the volume of rice per target, and the quota of rice between regions; if necessary, distributing rice at no charge
(c) BOS
Encourage regional participation to raise the budget (Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Daerah—APBD) contributions for the education sector, so free education services are provided to the affected communities
(d) Jamkesmas
Encourage regional participation to raise the APBD contributions for the health sector, so free health services are provided to affected communities
(e) BLT
BLT is implemented on an ad hoc basis in affected regions
(f) PKH
Development of PKH pilot regions is directed towards affected regions
(g) KUR
Raise the intensity and effectiveness of socialization activities and simplify the credit requirements and procedure
(3) Create special programs to respond to the impact of the crisis, for example, intensive work programs (cash for work)
c) To ensure the achievement of various government initiatives in improving the welfare of the community and sharpening an understanding of all PPS, the concept of PPS needs to be examined and understood under the following four objectives
(1) Universal program that is conducted as a government responsibility to develop Indonesia as a welfare state, such as free medical treatment (the development of Jamkesmas) and free schooling programs (development of BOS)
(2) Poverty reduction programs that are implemented sustainably in the effort to reduce the number of poor families through programs such as PKH, PNPM, and KUR
(3) Mass and local recovery programs from the impact of the crisis and disaster that are specially provided for communities hit by a socioeconomic shock to guarantee basic needs and recovery/provision of community businesses, such as through Raskin, BLT, and intensive work projects
(4) Social assistance programs that are specially provided to poor citizens who are not yet productive or not productive anymore, such as assistance for orphans, people with disabilities, and the elderly
d) The implementation of all PPS has to be integrated and be under the control of an institution at the central level that has strong authority
In addition, in their implementation, all PPS have to consider the politics of decentralization and regional participation
e) Universal programs need to oblige well-to-do community groups to contribute to funding
I
INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background The global financial crisis (GFC) 2008/09 has started to have an impact on Indonesia's economic conditions
However, several analysts have estimated that the impact has not been as severe as the experience of other countries due to Indonesia's relatively low level of economic integration with the global economy
The latest data confirms this negative impact
For example, BPS (Statistics Indonesia) (2009) stated that Indonesia's economic growth in the second quarter of 2009—although positive at 4%—slowed in comparison with economic growth of 4.4% in the first quarter of 2009
BPS also reported a significant fall in Indonesian exports
Export growth in December 2008 and January 2009 fell 20.56% and 36.08% respectively compared with the same months the previous year
This fall in exports caused a contraction in employment in various export-oriented industries such as automobiles, electronic goods, as well as iron and steel
In addition, the price of various plantation commodities for the export market also came under pressure which, in turn, put the welfare of farmers under stress
The impact of the GFC on Indonesia's economy is different to the impact of the economic crisis of 1997/98
In 1997/98, the crisis occurred as a consequence of the poor condition of domestic financial markets, evidenced, inter alia, by a high number of loan defaults, but demand for export goods remained high
In fact, the fall in the value of the rupiah at that time tended to benefit Indonesia's export products
On the contrary, during the GFC, although financial markets and Indonesia's economic fundamentals were quite good, demand for export goods tended to fall due to poor economic conditions in advanced countries
For that reason, the negative effects of the GFC are considered different to those experienced during the economic crisis of 1997/98
The GFC will probably also trigger the emergence of new groups of poor and/or vulnerable groups
In order to minimize the impact of the GFC, the government has issued a number of monetary and fiscal policies aimed at protecting economic stability and providing the stimulus for economic growth
In addition, various existing social protection programs (program perlindungan sosial—PPS) in the areas of food, education, health, business costs, and community empowerment continue to operate
All of these are expected to provide support for the community in facing the shocks of the crisis
Nevertheless, poverty is still a serious problem because approximately 15.5% of Indonesia's population is still living below the poverty line and around another 42% live just above the poverty line and are vulnerable to falling into poverty (BPS, 2009)
In this regard, the government and various other interested parties need to make efforts to overcome the negative effects of the GFC, so socioeconomic conditions in Indonesia do not worsen
Preparing programs and policies that are effective in minimizing the negative effects of the GFC needed a rapid appraisal of the impact of the crisis in order to determine the various socioeconomic changes that were occurring
The SMERU Research Institute, with the support of AusAID and in cooperation with the National Development Planning Board (Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional—Bappenas) has, since July 2009, been monitoring the socioeconomic impact of the GFC on Indonesia
This monitoring has been undertaken through four groups of activities, one of which is via case studies
These four activity groups are presented in
Case studies are conducted every four months to examine a particular issue or problem in depth
The research topic is determined on the basis of discussions with Bappenas and the development of information or the latest issues that are occurring in relation to the crisis
The first case study examined the role of social protection programs in responding to the negative effects of the GFC
1.2 Research Objectives The objectives of the first case study were to
ascertain an overall picture of the impact of the GFC on the community's socioeconomic conditions in the study areas
ascertain an overall picture of the social protection program policies of the central and regional governments
ascertain an overall picture of the benefits of existing social protection programs, both those of the central government and regional governments, in reducing the negative impact of the crisis
determine the benefits of existing social protection programs, both those of the central government and regional governments, for community livelihoods
investigate how implementing agencies have adapted or adjusted various existing social protection programs in responding to the impact of the crisis
provide policy recommendations to the government with the hope of improving the effectiveness of social protection programs or government programs that are aimed at responding to the impact of the crisis
1.3 Research Methodology
The first case study was undertaken during the August to November 2009 period
This was a qualitative study done through in-depth interviews by using semistructured guided questions
The collection of information and data was undertaken in two phases
During the first phase, information and data collection was done at the central level to ascertain an overall picture and implementation of social protection programs as well as indicators of the impact of the crisis
In the second phase, field visits were undertaken to two study kabupaten/kota (municipality) to collect information and data on the impact of the crisis on the community's socioeconomic condition, the implementation of social protection programs in the field and their effectiveness in reducing the negative effects of the crisis and alternative policies for those community groups who have been affected by the crisis
The policies or social protection programs examined cover
a) National Program for Community Empowerment (Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat —PNPM), 
b) Rice for Poor Households (Beras untuk Rumah Tangga Miskin—Raskin), 
c) School Operational Assistance (Bantuan Operasional Sekolah—BOS), 
d) Community Health Insurance Scheme (Jaminan Kesehatan Masyarakat—Jamkesmas), 
e) Direct Cash Transfer (Bantuan Langsung Tunai—BLT), 
f) Family of Hope Program (Program Keluarga Harapan—PKH), and 
g) Loans for Small-scale Businesses (Kredit Usaha Rakyat—KUR)
Research on policies or programs at the central level and the study kabupaten/kota was a bit different in emphasis
At the central level, research was undertaken on all programs, while in the study kabupaten/kota, the research was more focused on the implementation of the PNPM program
In addition, information was sought on regional government policies and programs that had the objectives of social protection and responding to the impact of the crisis
At the central level, the collection of information and data was undertaken through in-depth interviews with program implementing institutions and a literature study
In the study kabupaten/kota, the collection of information and data was undertaken through in-depth interviews with implementing agencies of various programs, especially PNPM, and associated regional government agencies
At the subdistrict (kecamatan) level, interviews were conducted with the camat (kecamatan head) and his or her staff who manage programs, PNPM facilitator, puskesmas, and junior high schools (sekolah menengah pertama—SMP)
At the village/kelurahan (urban village) level, in-depth interviews were conducted with the village head/lurah (kelurahan head) and his or her staff, the PNPM program management unit, primary schools (SD), social protection program recipient communities, communities affected by the crisis and food stall owners/traders
The communities in receipt of social protection programs and affected by the impact of the crisis were chosen with a snowball technique, were dispersed across several RT/dusun, and were a minimum of two different households for each PPS
In general, study areas were purposefully determined based on two criteria
the impact of the crisis and they received PNPM funding
The selection of areas hit by the crisis commenced by determining the economic sectors that had been most affected, namely plantations and mining
From each respective sector, one commodity that had been significantly affected by the crisis was selected, namely rubber and coal respectively
The Province of South Sumatra was selected as it is the largest rubber producer in Indonesia and the Province of South Kalimantan was also selected as it is a center for the production of both rubber and coal
On the basis of the same criteria, in each of these provinces one kabupaten/kota was selected as the study location
This was Kabupaten Musi Banyuasin (Muba) in the case of South Sumatra and Kabupaten Banjar in South Kalimantan
In each kabupaten, one kecamatan was chosen using the same criteria
At the kecamatan level, two study villages/kelurahan were determined because they were a production center for each respective commodity as well as the location for PNPM
These two villages/kelurahan also varied in their tendency to be either urban or rural as well as their access to, or distance from, the kabupaten capital
In South Kalimantan, in particular, the PKH also became an additional criterion in determining the research location because this province is one of the pilot sites for the implementation of PKH
By using these criteria, two villages in Kabupaten Muba—Desa Sukarami and Desa Muara Teladan in Kecamatan Sekayu—were visited
In Kabupaten Banjar, two villages in the Kecamatan Simpang Empat—Desa Batu Balian and Desa Cinta Puri—were visited
Desa Sukarami and Desa Batu Balian are semi-urban villages that are traversed by the interprovincial road and public transport and are close to the kecamatan capital
On the other hand, Desa Muara Teladan and Desa Cinta Puri are located quite far from a main road and the kecamatan capital and are not serviced by public transport
In fact, access to Desa Cinta Puri is via an asphalted road that is in quite poor repair and a dirt road that is difficult to use during the rainy/wet season
In South Kalimantan, there is one additional study village, that is, Desa Rantau Bakula in Kecamatan Sungai Pinang
This village is the location for coal mining and is located in the largest coal producing kecamatan in Kabupaten Banjar
However, this village and kecamatan have been less affected by the crisis because the communities there have a variety of farming activities and there is quite a large mining company that has been able to survive and has not reduced the size of its workforce
1.4 Report Structure The report on the outcome of this first case study is divided into five parts
Chapter one is the introduction that describes the background, objectives of the study, and the methodology used
Chapter two is a brief observation of social protection program developments in Indonesia and a policy overview of each PPS originating from the center and regions
Chapter three discusses a general overview of the impact of the GFC on the socioeconomic conditions of the community in the study region
Chapter four analyzes the implementation of central and regional government social protection programs, their role in alleviating the impact of the crisis, their benefits for the community, and whether or not there has been an attempt by implementing agencies to adapt or adjust them as a response to the crisis
Chapter five is the final chapter which draws some conclusions as well as makes recommendations for the effort to respond to the crisis and reduce its effects
II
GENERAL PICTURE OF THE SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS 2008/2009 
In all study villages, the GFC 2008/09 had an impact on almost all the community from various levels of prosperity
This occurred because most villagers have livelihoods that are directly connected to rubber or coal whose price fell dramatically as a consequence of the GFC
2.1 Impact of the GFC on the People's Rubber Economy Fluctuations in the price of natural rubber are a normally occurring phenomenon (Figure 2)
In general, rises and falls in the domestic price of rubber are a dynamic reflection of the rise and fall in the supply and demand for world rubber
Fluctuations in the price of rubber are often worsened by a slump in the world oil price as the raw material for the production of synthetic rubber which is used as a substitute for natural rubber
The global crisis that shook the world economy last year is the main causative factor for the freefall in the price of rubber at the end of 2008
The price of rubber lump at the farm gate that was previously around Rp10,000 per kg (monthly average), according to several respondents even reaching Rp11,500 per kg in October 2008, slumped to approximately Rp2,500 per kg
This slump in the price of rubber caused the average income of rubber plantation workers/tappers to fall by up to three quarters
When the price of rubber was Rp11,500 per kg with an average of 15 kg of rubber tapped per day, a farmer's monthly income (20 days work) was Rp3.5 million
When the price fell to Rp2,500 per kg, their monthly income was only Rp750,000
Nevertheless, the seriousness of the impact of the GFC varies between community groups working in rubber production, such as tappers, plantation owners, and intermediary traders
Tappers are the group that has been most seriously affected
Their welfare level fell significantly due to their limited incomes and savings
The welfare level of plantation owners and rubber traders remained relatively stable because they had savings or assets that they accrued when the price of rubber was high
In addition, the total income they received when the price fell remained relatively higher than the income of tappers
A series of following impacts occurring as a consequence of the fall in rubber farmers' incomes included
quiet markets, 
less turnover in food stalls and for traders, 
loans for motorcycles defaulted or the motorcycles were seized
the quality of consumption fell
children received fewer snacks than before
there were fewer community social activities
The following are some of the comments made by respondents in Muba about the impact of the global crisis on the communities whose main income source is rubber during the field visits in October 2009
a) “When the price of rubber was high, the market was busy and the streets were clogged
When the price of rubber fell, the market was quiet
And when the price of rubber fell sharply, the community panicked” (Social Affairs Agency of Kabupaten Muba, October 14, 2009)
b) Food stalls became quiet
Many community members had debts and were no longer able to make payments (several respondents, October 15–19, 2009)
c) “When the price of rubber was high, our turnover reached Rp1 million per night with Rp700,000 on credit
When the price of rubber fell, we only took Rp400,000–Rp500,000 per night with a credit level of Rp300,000” (coffee stall owner, female, 40 years, October 15, 2009)
d) “When the price of rubber was high, almost every family owned a motorcycle
In fact, some owned two to three motorcycles” (community figure and village staff, October 14, 2009)
e) Loans defaulted
A lot of motorcycles were seized or returned to dealers because the community was unable to make payments on their loans
Of a total of 1,200 household heads in Desa Muara Teladan, Kabupaten Muba, approximately 700 returned motorcycles to the dealer (several informants, October 15–16, 2009)
f) “I was forced to return my motorcycle because I was no longer able to make repayments” (household respondent, male, 32 years, October 16, 2009)
g) “There were fewer snacks for children and children were sometimes taken to the plantation to accompany and assist their parents to reduce their snacking” (village head, male, October 15, 2009)
h) Although the price of rubber fell, the community did not go hungry and were still able to eat rice and fish because fish were easily obtained (several informants, October 14, 2009)
i) The amount and variety of food consumed declined
Food was regarded more as the source of energy
What was important was that rice and kerosene were available
Sugar was no longer used as a sweetener because it was expensive
j) “There was no change in the eating pattern and quantity, but the quality fell” (several village community figures, October 15, 2009)
When the price of rubber was very low, several survival techniques emerged, especially amongst the tapping community, including
(i) becoming a laborer for an oil palm company, sand mining, and people's plantation; (ii) leaving the province to move to another place as far as Java; (iii) selling assets; (iv) becoming a worker on a PNPM project; and (v) opening other people's land for daily wages or on contract
In early 2000, the price of rubber started to rise
During the visit of the SMERU team, the price of rubber at the farm gate had risen to Rp6,500 per kg
Although this price was still about 60% of the pre-crisis price, the community felt that their economic conditions had started to improve
In fact, some of them considered that conditions have fully recovered because, even before the crisis, the price of rubber also fluctuated and farmers sometimes sold at this price
2.2 Impact of the GFC on Communities Near Coal Mining Sites The impact of the GFC on coal mining communities has been relatively less extensive because many companies have been able to survive
The price of coal that fell approximately 50% is still considered economically viable
A fall in the sales volume also did not result in large-scale mining companies ceasing operations
Although companies experienced a fall in profits, in fact even recording losses, this was still better than having to close the business, given the scale of the investments that they had made
The certainty that conditions would improve also had an impact on their decision
However, some small-scale mining companies were forced to close down, resulting in a direct impact on their workers
In general, the GFC has had relatively little impact on workers being laid off
In fact, it could be said that there have been no layoffs in large coal mining companies and workers are still receiving an income as was the case before the crisis
For that reason, the GFC has had relatively little impact on formal or permanent workers
Nevertheless, casual workers such as truck drivers, workers putting a canvass cover on trucks, parking attendants, and security guards on the coal stockpile (the place where coal is kept before it is transported to the port) have experienced a greater impact
The volume of work available to them has fallen with a consequential less of income
In fact, for coal truck drivers in particular hauling coal from the stockpile to the port have also seen a fall in the value of the premium
Previously, they could obtain a premium of around Rp1 million for one load, but after the crisis, this fell to only Rp250,000
Although the coal market has started to improve recently, mining activities, stockpiling, and coal cartage in Kecamatan Simpang Empat, Kabupaten Banjar, has suffered a dramatic decline
This is the result of the enactment of Regional (South Kalimantan) Government Regulation No
3/2008 on Regulating the Use of Public and Special Roads for the Transport of Mining and Plantation Company Products
This regional regulation, among other things, bans the transport of coal mining and oil palm plantation products on public roads and has been in effect since August 23, 2009
This regional regulation, which was enacted in January 2008, has actually been socialized for quite long time and its enactment was delayed so the relevant parties had the opportunity to construct special roads
Several companies in other areas already have special roads, while special roads in the vicinity of Kecamatan Simpang Empat that were pioneered by a number of companies in 2007 have not yet been completed
As a consequence of the enactment of this regional regulation and the special coal roads that are not yet ready, hundreds of coal trucks that normally use the main roads of Kecamatan Simpang Empat on the way to the port in Banjarmasin have had to cease operating
Almost all coal companies, transport service providers, and providers of stockpile sites in the vicinity of this main road have been forced to close their businesses
As a consequence, various kinds of businesses along this road such as workshops, tire repairers, snack/food stalls, and petrol stations have experienced a decline in trade or have closed
Few companies have been able to survive
The ones that have are located close to the special coal transport roads that had previously existed
They have to transport coal on roads in a roundabout manner and use other ports so the cost of transporting the coal is far more expensive
As a result, their business activity has gone into decline
The following are some of the stories describing the impact of the GFC and the application of the regional regulation banning the transport of mining products on main roads
a) One operator of mining company heavy equipment who was earning Rp6 million per month lost his employment several months ago without receiving any separation pay
b) One driver for a coal company has suffered a fall in his working hours and now receives a basic wage of only Rp500,000 per month and in several months time, his company will be closing
He previously had an income of approximately Rp1 million to Rp1.5 million per month
As a result, he has started to find it difficult to fulfill his family's basic needs
c) A shop that sells daily needs, agricultural equipment, and motorcycle spare parts has experienced a fall in its turnover from Rp1.5 million to Rp1 million per day because the community are economizing and tend to use non-original spare parts for their motorcycles
d) Since early 2009, a store that sells basic needs and instant food has experienced a fall in its turnover from approximately Rp1.5 million to Rp800,000 per day
e) A vegetable trader in a pasar kaget, a momentary market taking place when there is an event or celebration, has seen a fall in turnover from around Rp1.5 million per day to Rp500,000 to Rp1 million per day
f) A clothes seller who could previously sell Rp2 million worth of clothes per day has experienced a fall in sales since the onset of the crisis and has seen the situation worsen since this regional regulation was enacted
At the present time, it is difficult to turnover Rp200,000 per day
g) In general, the weekly market has seen a fall in the number of traders, especially clothes sellers, so almost half of the available kiosks are empty
In addition, the number of buyers has also fallen sharply
The community that has lost jobs in coal mining is trying to survive by undertaking other kinds of activities
Most of them have taken work as rubber farmers, both in their own plantations and those of other owners
Those who have a rubber plantation have gone back to working the plantation intensively
Those who do not own a plantation have been able to work on their parents' or relatives' plantations
This has caused a reduction in the area under cultivation and/or a conversion from other people's land
As a consequence, former coal workers, rubber plantation owners, and rubber plantation tenant farmers have experienced a fall in their income
Some former coal workers who do not have land to cultivate in the local village have become cultivators outside the kecamatan, or even outside the kabupaten
Many truck drivers have also taken their trucks outside the province to cart other commodities
A sign of the number of households who have moved from the kabupaten is reflected in the number of primary school students who have changed schools
Other former coal workers have changed profession to become motorcycle mechanics or odd-job workers
Some of them are also still unemployed
2.3 Authorities' Awareness of the Impact of the GFC Even now the negative impact of the GFC is still being felt by the community although the intensity has declined and varies across different business activities and community groups
However, many government authorities are insufficiently aware and do not have an in-depth and overall understanding of the various effects of the GFC at the community level
Some government officials do not know there has been any effect
In fact, some state that the GFC has had no impact on their area
Some other officials are only aware of the general impact of the GFC, especially on the business sector that operates in the local area
For example, the GFC has caused the price of certain commodities such as rubber and coal to fall
However, the level of knowledge of government officials on the impact of the GFC on community livelihoods is very limited
In general, government officials, especially at the kabupaten level, do not understand what is really happening and what the follow-on impact of the GFC is on various aspects of community livelihoods
This situation has occurred due to the lack of a tiered, periodic, and systematic means of collecting information on the socioeconomic conditions of the community
Knowledge on the community's socioeconomic condition is usually only held by government officials at the village or kecamatan level
Even then, the information that they have is usually only partial in nature
III
SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMS IN INDONESIA 3.1 A Brief Review of Social Protection Program Developments at the National Level 
Prior to the economic crisis of 1997/98, Indonesia had succeeded in lowering the country's poverty level
This is evident from a fall in the proportion of the population living in poverty from 40.1% in 1976 to 11.3% in 1996
However, the economic crisis of 1997/98 had an impact on the incidence of poverty by adding more than 14 million people during the 1996– 1999 period
Government efforts to reduce the impact of this crisis included the implementation of the Social Safety Net Program (Program Jaring Pengaman Sosial—JPS) and boosting economic growth in the form of developments in various sectors
The outcome is evident from a fall in the poverty rate
In fact, the level of poverty in 2005 was lower than the pre-crisis level
However, at the end of 2005 through 2006, the poverty level again rose, which was mainly due to a jump in the price of fuel oil products (bahan bakar minyak—BBM) in March and October 2005 that had a consequential impact in rising prices for various basic commodities
In addition to a poverty rate that was still quite high, Indonesia also faced problems of inequity that were quite serious
Access for poor households to various basic services, for example, was worse than that for nonpoor households
Inequity arising from gender relations was also still a problem in the daily socioeconomic life of the community
During the first five Pelita (five-year development programs) from 1969–1994, the government did not explicitly include poverty reduction on its development agenda
During this period, poverty reduction was undertaken through a general development approach that emphasized agricultural development
Then in Pelita VI (1994), the government included poverty reduction as an objective of national development
Until today, this policy is still the main focus of the national development agenda
Social Protection Policies 
In general, social protection covers social security and social assistance
Law No
40/2004 on the National Social Security System (Sistem Jaminan Sosial Nasional—SJSN) states that social security is one form of social protection to ensure that the community can adequately fulfill the basic needs of life
In a formal social security system, participation is compulsory for each citizen and funds are sourced from participants' contributions
On the other hand, social assistance is a temporary and ad hoc social protection mechanism to overcome community disempowerment caused by natural disasters, epidemics, and crises
Funding for social assistance is sourced from government subsidies, either partially or fully, without any community contribution
The target is the poor, including nonformal workers
The SJSN law also aimed to broaden the scope of social security participation to cover workers in the formal and nonformal sectors as well as the poor and vulnerable groups
Section 14, for example, requires the government to pay the contributions of the destitute and those who are not well-off to a social security management agency
Furthermore, Section 17 states that, in the first phase, these contributions should be paid by the government for health security programs
This is now being undertaken by the government through the Jamkesmas Program and the Community Health Service Scheme (Jaminan Pelayanan Kesehatan Masyarakat—JPKM)
Various types of existing social assistance schemes can be categorized in the JPS program and social rehabilitation
The JPS program was launched not long after the economic crisis of 1997/98 to assist in reducing the impact of the crisis
The JPS program covered the health sector (Social Safety Net-Health Sector, or Jaring Pengaman Sosial-Bidang Kesehatan—JPSBK), education (scholarship program and Operational Assistance Fund, or Dana Bantuan Operasional—DBO), food (Special Market Operation, or Operasi Pasar Khusus—OPK), revolving funds, and intensive work programs
Until now, the government is still providing various programs of this type or their continuation only under a different name
In 2000/01, the Fuel (BBM) Subsidy Re-orientation Program covered cash transfers, revolving funds, community empowerment, education (Special Assistance for Students, or Bantuan Khusus Murid—BKM, and Special Assistance for Schools, or Bantuan Khusus Sekolah—BKS), and health
In 2005, the Compensation Program for Reduced Fuel Subsidies (Program Kompensasi Pengurangan Subsidi BBM—PKPS-BBM) covered the health sector (Health Insurance Scheme for Poor Families, or Jaminan Pemeliharaan Kesehatan Keluarga Miskin—JPK Gakin), education (BOS), food (Raskin), and BLT
For social rehabilitation, assistance was directed to the victims of natural and social disasters such as earthquakes, floods and civil disturbances
Targeted Poverty Reduction Policy 
In general, targeted poverty reduction consists of community empowerment and social protection programs
National community empowerment programs commenced with the Presidential Instruction Program for Disadvantaged Villages (Program Inpres Desa Tertinggal— IDT) that operated between 1993−1997 and the Prosperous Family Development Program (Program Pembangunan Keluarga Sejahtera) that was implemented through the Prosperous Family Savings Program (Program Tabungan Keluarga Sejahtera—Takesra) and Prosperous Family Business Credit (Kredit Usaha Keluarga Sejahtera—Kukesra) between 1996−2003
Long before these two programs, there was a similar program on a smaller scale (in 12 provinces)
the Income Generating Program for Small-scale Farmers and Fishers (Program Pembinaan dan Peningkatan Pendapatan Petani/Nelayan Kecil—P4K) that was implemented between 1979−2005
These three programs had similar components, namely providing business capital assistance and mentoring
The IDT program was supported by the assistance with physical infrastructure development to support the community's economic activities undertaken through the Supporting Infrastructure Development Projects for Disadvantaged Villages (Proyek Pembangunan Prasarana Pendukung Desa Tertinggal—P3DT)
National community empowerment programs that are similar to the three programs described above include the Kecamatan Development Program (Program Pengembangan Kecamatan— PPK) and the Urban Poverty Reduction Program (Program Penanggulangan Kemiskinan di Perkotaan—P2KP)
The PPK commenced in 1998 and the P2KP in 1999
In 2007, the government integrated these two programs into the PNPM that was larger in scale
PNPM, also known as PNPM Mandiri, provided an umbrella for two categories of activities
PNPMInti (the core program) and PNPM-Penguatan (the support program), each of which consists of a number of programs
In 2007, the government also introduced two new programs, a pilot program for conditional cash transfers or PKH that was more directed to assisting in improving the education and health level of very poor households (rumah tangga sangat miskin—RTSM) and the KUR program, as a continuation of Presidential Instruction No
6/2007 on Policy on Accelerating the Development of the Real Sector and Empowerment of Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Businesses (Usaha Mikro, Kecil, dan Menengah—UMKM)
In 2008, the government launched the Jamkesmas program that is the successor to the Askeskin program (Health Insurance Program for the Poor, or Program Asuransi Kesehatan untuk Masyarakat Miskin)
Several Important Lessons 
The following are the general trends with the implementation of the various social protection programs in Indonesia
a) PPS is sectoral in nature and not integrated, are insufficiently coordinated across programs, differ in the concept of a poor household (rumah tangga miskin—RTM), and ignore the nonformal sector—whereas more than one-half of the Indonesian population depends on this sector for their livelihoods—and those who do not have official identification
For that reason, from one perspective, there is often mistargeting, while, on the other hand, there is undercoverage
b) PPS are centralistic; the central government regulates, plans, implements, and supervises the programs
In other words, PPS do not take sufficient of decentralized politics that results in many regions taking the attitude of dependency on social protection for their citizens from the central government
c) PPS do not have an exit strategy, so poor households that receive assistance and succeed in moving out of poverty will continue to receive assistance
On the other hand, those who are still trapped in poverty often lose the opportunity to receive assistance because of inaccurate targeting, the need for equitable distribution of assistance, or the program's sudden termination
3.2 An Overview of National Social Protection Program 
When the GFC 2008/09 hit Indonesia, the government continued with several existing PPS
The national PPS or those that emanated from the central government included PNPM, Raskin, BOS, Jamkesmas, BLT, PKH, and KUR
With the exception of BLT that was only carried out until February 2009, all the other PPS are still in effect
Several of these PPS have aims, mechanisms, and specific targets that vary from one to another, as is now analyzed in the following discussion
3.2.1 National Program for Community Empowerment (PNPM Mandiri) PNPM Mandiri was launched on April 30, 2007 and is a successor to the PPK and P2KP
PPK was introduced in 1998 for rural areas, while P2KP was introduced in 1999 for urban areas
These two programs use a local institutional development model to apply the principles of participatory development and gender equity
Given that empowerment processes generally need five to six years, PNPM Mandiri will at least continue until 2015
Basically, PNPM Mandiri results from the harmony and synergy between various poverty reduction programs which are empowering in nature
PNPM Mandiri is divided into two main categories; the core program (PNPM-Inti) and the support program (PNPM-Penguatan)
PNPM-Inti is a regional community empowerment program that incorporates PPK, P2KP, the Rural Infrastructure Development Program (Program Pengembangan Infrastruktur Perdesaan—PPIP), the Regional Socioeconomic Infrastructure Development Program (Program Pengembangan Infrastruktur Sosial-Ekonomi Wilayah—PISEW), and the Development Acceleration Program for Disadvantaged and Special Regions (Program Percepatan Pembangunan Daerah Tertinggal dan Khusus—P2DTK)
PNPM-Penguatan is a sectoral and regional community empowerment program that is particularly directed towards supporting poverty reduction which is aimed at achieving specific targets
PNPM-Penguatan consists of, among others, PNPM Healthy and Intelligent Generation (PNPM Generasi Sehat dan Cerdas—PNPM Generasi), Green PNPM (PNPM Hijau), Development of Rural Agribusinesses (Pengembangan Usaha Agribisnis Perdesaan—PUAP), Community-based Sanitation and Drinking Water Provision (Penyediaan Air Minum dan Sanitasi Berbasis Masyarakat—Pamsimas), and Direct Community Financial Assistance for Agricultural Investment (Bantuan Langsung Masyarakat untuk Keringanan Investasi Pertanian—BLMKIP)
The broad scope of PNPM Mandiri is presented in Figure 3
The total budget for PNPM Mandiri has risen since the program was initiated
In 2007, the budget was only Rp3.8 trillion for the implementation of two programs—PPK and P2KP
In 2008 and 2009, the total budget had risen to Rp11.1 trillion and Rp13.7 trillion for the implementation of all PNPM-Inti and PNPM-Penguatan programs
The planned budget for 2010 will rise to Rp16 trillion, among others, in anticipation of the impact of the GFC
For PNPM-Inti, in particular, the budget and number of kecamatan has also increased
In 2007, PNPM-Inti only covered 2,831 kecamatan with a budget of Rp3.8 trillion and in 2009, this had risen to 6,408 kecamatan with a budget of Rp10.36 trillion (see Table 1)
In general, the objective of PNPM Mandiri is to accelerate poverty reduction and broaden employment opportunities through consolidating existing community empowerment programs
In particular, the objective of this program is to enhance the role of the community, the capacity of community institutions, the capacity of government (in providing services, empowering, and building community autonomy), community social capital, and innovation in and the utilization of technology/information
The main characteristic of this program is that the planning and decision-making are done by the community through intergroup competition
For that reason, the community is required to be actively involved in each step of the decision-making process and work together in the implementation
The range of possible PNPM Mandiri activities is basically open (open menu) to all poverty reduction activities that are suggested and agreed by the community
Several of these possible activities include the provision and repair of the infrastructure of residential areas as well as social and economic infrastructure through labor-intensive projects, and the provision of financial resources through revolving funds and micro-credit to develop the economic activities of poor communities
The management of PNPM Mandiri is based on participatory principles in the form of planning at the village/kelurahan level, intervillage/kelurahan planning (at the kecamatan level), and coordinative planning at the kabupaten/kota level
The important issue in participatory planning at the village/kelurahan level is the role of village/kelurahan officials in community facilitation
At the kecamatan level, participatory planning is aimed at prioritizing activities across villages/kelurahan based on the outcome of the participatory planning process at the village/kelurahan level and at the same time synergizing this with the kabupaten/kota development plan
The institutional structure of PNPM Mandiri covers various parties from the center to the village level, from government and the community, with a tiered system of account-giving and reporting
At the central level, there is a control team consisting of a command team and an implementation team whose activities in each program are undertaken by a work unit (satker) in each relevant department
At the central level, there is also a national consultant who provides technical assistance on program implementation
At the provincial and kabupaten/kota levels, there is a coordination team, a satker, and a consultant
At the kecamatan level, there is an implementation taskforce known as the local project manager (penanggung jawab operasional kegiatan—PJOK)
PJOK is assisted by associated elements such as an intervillage coordination body (badan kerja sama antardesa—BKAD), an intervillage/kelurahan consultative forum (musyawarah antardesa/kelurahan—MAD/K), activity management units (unit pengelola kegiatan—UPK), and facilitators
At the village level, there is an NGO (lembaga keswadayaan masyarakat—LKM) that, together with associated elements at the kecamatan level functions as the manager of PNPM Mandiri activities in the village/kelurahan
The PNPM Mandiri satker at each level is responsible for funding and disbursement activities
Funds for the implementation of PNPM Mandiri are channeled directly to the community via a joint account at the nearest government bank
Each bank account opening or fund withdrawal needs the signature of at least three recipient community members
The disbursement of BLM (bantuan langsung masyarakat or direct community assistance) funds to the community's account and its use are done in stages
If there is any digression or irregularity in implementation, the PNPM Mandiri satker, based on a recommendation from the mentoring consultant or the local regional government, can cancel the funding disbursement
To ensure the transparency and accountability of activities and the use of BLM funds at the community level, the UPK or LKM is obliged to spread out the decision that has been made, reports on the financial position, the activity management group, members of the funding recipient/s, and other information
This effort to ensure accountability is evidenced by providing access to all interested parties to conduct audits, ask questions, and/or demand accountability from decision-makers, at the program, region, or community level
3.2.2 Rice for Poor Households (Raskin) Poverty reduction programs in the food sector have been rolled out by the government since June 1998 under the name of Special Market Operations (OPK) which is one of the JPS programs
The OPK program was initially only to reduce the impact of the economic crisis of 1997/98 for the poor but was then continued as a social protection program for poor households and groups with food scarcity
In 2002, the name OPK was changed to Raskin, which is still running until today
The objective of Raskin is to reduce the expenditure burden on poor households through the provision of assistance in the fulfillment of some basic food needs in the form of rice
Through this program, the government provides rice at a subsidized price to poor households each month
During the implementation period, the price, volume, and frequency of distribution of Raskin has changed several times
During the period of 1998−2007, the price at the distribution point was set at Rp1,000 per kg and since 2008, this has risen to Rp1,600 per kg
The allocation of rice per target household changed from a range of 10–20 kg to 15 kg in 2008
The distribution is not always monthly but varies from 10–12 times per year
Early on in the implementation of Raskin (1998−1999), the program planner and manager were the office of the State Minister for Food and Horticulture in cooperation with the National Food Logistics Agency (Badan Urusan Logistik—Bulog)
At the present time, the managing coordinator is the Coordinating Minister for Peoples' Welfare (Menko Kesra) and the agency responsible for rice distribution is Bulog together with local governments
Bulog is responsible for distributing rice to the distribution point, while local governments are responsible for distributing the rice from the distribution point to target households (rumah tangga sasaran—RTS)
Initially, the program recipients were the poor; however, the basic data being used changed
Until 2005, Raskin recipients were determined from data on Pre-prosperous Families and Prosperous Families 1 (Keluarga Prasejahtera and Keluarga Sejahtera 1) from the National Family Planning Coordination Board (Badan Koordinasi Keluarga Berencana Nasional— BKKBN)
Since 2006, program recipients have been determined from BPS data based on the Socioeconomic Data Collection 2005 (Pendataan Sosial-Ekonomi 2005—PSE-05) and the outcomes of the update
Nevertheless, this reference data was not always fully used because the number of target households was less than the number of poor households identified in the data collection process with the exception of 2008 and 2009 (see Table 2)
In addition, at the village/kelurahan level, the reference data was verified through community consultation to determine recipient households
The funding of Raskin has become part of the routine national budget (Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Negara—APBN) and is no longer being sourced from loan moneys
Table 1 shows that, from year to year, APBN funds applied to this program have been growing because of a rise in the number of target households and an increase in the price of rice
In 2009, the budget had risen to Rp12.98 trillion or approximately 2.5 times the budget in 2005
3.2.3 School Operational Assistance (BOS) Poverty reduction programs in the education sector commenced in 1998 when the government initiated the Scholarship Program and DBO that were part of JPS
To complete this program, the government in 2001 introduced similar programs under the name BKM and BKS that were part of the BBM compensation program
Through the Scholarship Program and BKM, assistance was only provided to certain students from poor families
To lighten the burden on the community for education costs and to achieve the objectives of the Nine Years of Compulsory Basic Education Program (Program Wajib Belajar Pendidikan Dasar—Wajardikdas), the government introduced the BOS program, which is a universal program for all students, in July 2005
Initially, the program was part of the PKPS-BBM, but later it formed part of the poverty reduction program, a situation that still continues
Through this program, the government provides operational funds for primary schools and junior high schools, both public and private, with the objective of providing free education to poor students and lowering the costs for nonpoor students
In 2008, the gross participation rate (angka partisipasi kasar—APK) in junior high schools reached 96.2%, meaning that the target of Wajardikdas had been reached
For that reason, in 2009, the government altered the objectives, approach, and orientation of BOS
BOS is expected to not only maintain the APK but also to raise the quality of education
In 2009, the allocation of funds to BOS also rose significantly
The allocation per student per year in primary schools rose from Rp254,000 to Rp397,000 for kabupaten areas and Rp400,000 for urban areas
The allocation to junior high schools rose from Rp354,000 to Rp570,000 for kabupaten areas and Rp575,000 for urban areas (see Table 3)
With this rise in funding, BOS is expected to become the main pillar in providing free basic education
BOS funds are channeled through a bank or post office to each school each quarter in accordance with the number of students
Funds are managed autonomously by schools with the involvement of the teachers' council and school committee
Schools are obliged to use some of the BOS funds to purchase text books whose copyright has been procured by the government
In addition, BOS funds can also be used to fund various activities and school needs within limits
For open junior high schools (SMP Terbuka), in particular, BOS funds can be used for supervisory, counseling, learning, and administrative activities as well as for transportation for guru bina, guru pamong, and administrative officials
BOS funds may not be kept long-term to earn interest; loaned to other parties; and used for medium and major rehabilitation, construction of buildings/new rooms, or activities that are already being funded by government (central or regional), either wholly or in part, for example paying the cost of contract teachers or assistant teachers (guru bantu)
All public schools are obliged to accept BOS funds and if they refuse, the relevant school is prohibited from levying costs on students
All private schools with an operating permission which are not being developed as a school with international standard (sekolah bertaraf internasional—SBI) or a local school with superior standard are obliged to accept BOS funds
Schools can only refuse BOS funds if they obtain the agreement of parents by guaranteeing to continue educating poor students
In parallel with a rise in BOS funding allocations since 2009, all public primary and junior high schools have to exempt students from school operating costs, with the exception of pilot schools with international standard (rintisan sekolah bertaraf internasional—RSBI) and SBI
Public schools categorized as an RSBI and SBI are permitted to raise funds from well-off parents with the agreement of the school committee and on condition that they have to exempt poor students from educational costs
In the implementation of the BOS program, regional governments are obliged to control the collection of operational costs in private primary and junior high schools, so poor students are exempt from levies and nonpoor students are not levied excessively
Local governments are required to sanction schools that breach these stipulations
In addition, local governments are responsible for issuing regulations on the determination of “reasonable limits” in the use of education funds by taking into consideration socioeconomic, geographical, and other factors
If BOS funds are not sufficient, the local government is obliged to make up the shortfall from their own budget (Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Daerah—APBD)
3.2.4 Community Health Insurance Scheme (Jamkesmas) Government efforts to provide a guarantee to the poor in obtaining health services commenced in 1998 with the implementation of the Health Card Program (Program Kartu Sehat) which was part of the JPS
Health Cards can be used to obtain free treatment at a puskesmas and referral for inpatient or outpatient treatment at a Class III room at a government hospital
Since 2001, this program has been succeeded by the PKPS-BBM Health Sector
In 2005, the government changed the program mechanism to an insurance system by establishing Askeskin
The government appointed PT Askes as a partner in the implementation and management of the funds
The scope of Askeskin is broader as it provides free inpatient and outpatient care at a puskesmas; inpatient care in a Class III room and outpatient care in a government hospital; the provision of funds to support the revitalization of posyandu (pos pelayanan terpadu or integrated health services post), nutritional supplements, and operating funds for puskesmas; health services in isolated regions; and additional funding for medications and vaccines
As the successor to Askeskin, the government launched the Jamkesmas program in 2008
The scope of the two programs is basically the same; however, the priority of the Jamkesmas program is the provision of health services to poor pregnant women in order to lower the maternal and infant mortality rates
The implementation mechanism of the two programs is rather different because the management and payment under Jamkesmas are separated into separate agencies—the Ministry of Health/Health Agency and PT Askes respectively
This change aims to hasten the hospital's claim by assigning a verification officer at the hospital and transferring funds directly from the state's cash reserves to the hospital
In general, the objective of the Jamkesmas program is to enhance access to and the quality of health services to provide an optimal standard of health care effectively and efficiently to all participants
The program's targets are the poor and the not well-off covering 18.9 households or 76.4 million people, not including those who already have other forms of health insurance
The target number is based on BPS 2006 data, while participation is determined by a decree from the kabupaten head (bupati)/mayor (walikota)
On the basis of this decree, a national database of participants was prepared and was then used as the basis for printing and distributing the Jamkesmas membership cards
Over the two years it has been operating, budget allocations to Jamkesmas have remained stable at Rp4.6 trillion
Of this amount, Rp3.6 trillion is allocated to pay out services at referral hospitals and Rp1 trillion to pay for the cost of services at puskesmas
During the implementation of Jamkesmas 2009, the government made several amendments
Improvements related to participation covered
(i) local governments can update the data on participants in accordance with BPS data from the end of 2008; 
(ii) the homeless, beggars, and abandoned children who do not yet have an identity card are guaranteed coverage by Jamkesmas by using a certificate or a recommendation letter from the local Social Affairs Agency; and 
(iii) PKH participants are guaranteed services under the Jamkesmas program and those who do not yet have a Jamkesmas card can use their PKH card
Under the Jamkesmas program, the role and function of the local government at the provincial and kabupaten/kota levels are quite clear
They form a coordination team and a management team for the Jamkesmas program at the provincial and kabupaten/kota levels
In addition, the local government must contribute to ensuring the success of Jamkesmas and the inclusion of the poor who are not included in the participants' quota
3.2.5 Direct Cash Transfer (BLT) Program 
Under the PKPS-BBM, the government has undertaken several BLT programs
The first BLT program, known as BLT 2005, was rolled out in October 2005 over the following 12-month period
The second BLT program, BLT 2008 (also known as BLT-RTS) was rolled out over a seven-month period from June until December 2008
Finally, BLT 2009 was only paid over a two-month period, January–February 2009, on the basis that the impact of the rise in the price of subsidized fuel products on the poor had already subsided
The legal basis for this program was Presidential Instruction No
12/2005 and Presidential Instruction No
3/2008
Actually, in 2000, the government also undertook a similar BLT program under the name of cash assistance (bantuan dana tunai); however, its scope was limited and it only provided Rp10,000 of assistance per poor household over a three-month period
The objective of the BLT program is to assist the poor to continue fulfilling their basic needs, prevent a fall in the welfare level of the poor as a consequence of economic difficulties, and enhance collaborative social responsibility
During BLT 2005, there were 19.1 million target households which were determined by BPS in their PSE-05 data collection exercise and were later adjusted with additional recipients in early 2006
These target households consisted of poor, very poor, and almost poor households
BLT 2008 used data on target households produced through a verification exercise by BPS through the Basic Health and Education Services Survey (Survei Pelayanan Dasar Kesehatan dan Pendidikan—SPDKP) of 2007 in 1,023 kecamatan associated with PKH, so there were fewer target households—19.02 million
Under BLT 2009, the number of target households fell again to 18.5 million in accordance with the outcome of BPS's verification and evaluation via the Social Protection Program Data Collection 2008 (Pendataan Program Perlindungan Sosial 2008—PPLS08)
This reduction in numbers occurred because some targeted households had died, changed address, or improved their welfare level, while there were fewer replacement households
Through the BLT program, each target household receives Rp100,000 per month every two to four months
As proof of their status as a BLT recipient, the household is given a BBM compensation card (kartu kompensasi BBM—KKB) that contains their identity details and a photograph of the head of the recipient family
The KKB card is printed by PT Pos Indonesia on the basis of RTS data obtained from the central office of BPS
The KKB card is used by the target household when collecting their funds at the post office
Over the years, the budget allocation for the BLT program has fallen
The budget allocations for BLT 2005, BLT 2008, and BLT 2009 were Rp23 trillion, Rp14.1 trillion, and Rp3.7 trillion respectively
In 2010, the government did not set aside a budget for the BLT program because social protection will be provided through various other programs
This decline in the budget allocation is particularly related to the length of time that assistance is provided under the program (the number of months assistance is paid)
The execution of the BLT program is coordinated by various sectors who work cooperatively on the basis of the main functions and duties of the respective institution
At the central level, the responsible agency is the Ministry of Social Affairs that has appointed PT Pos Indonesia and BRI to undertake the task of disbursing funds to target households
A program execution unit (unit pelaksanaan program—UPP) was formed to coordinate activities at each level of government from the center to the kecamatan, with the authority to establish, supervise, and monitor the execution of the program
Each UPP is headed by the department/social agency with a membership drawn from various associated government bodies at each level of government
3.2.6 Family of Hope Program (PKH) 
In order to accelerate the reduction in poverty, the development of social protection policy, and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the government has been running the Family of Hope Program (PKH) since 2007
The main objective of PKH is to reduce poverty and raise the quality of human resources, especially that of the very poor
PKH is specifically aimed at enhancing the socioeconomic conditions of very poor households (RTSM); raising children's education level; improving the health and nutritional status of pregnant women, women who have just given birth, and children under six years of age; improving the access to and quality of education and health services; and improving school enrollment rates in primary and high school for very poor households
The targets of PKH are RTSM that have children from 0–6 years of age and/or children 7–15 years of age or less than 18 years of age who have not yet completed the nine years of schooling and/or pregnant women or mothers who have just given birth
Unlike other social protection programs, PKH recipient households must fulfill several special requirements related to health and education
putting children 7–18 years of age through nine years of schooling, bringing children 0–6 years of age to health facilities, and having checkups for pregnant women and their unborn child at a health facility
It is intended to continue this program until at least 2015
The scope of recipients will be expanded in phases up to 6.5 million RTSM
decline as these households experience an improvement in their welfare level and move out of the target group
PKH provides assistance in the form of cash, in the range of Rp600,000–Rp2,200,000 per RTSM per year
This range is in accordance with the condition of members of the household related to the basic health and education needs that have to be fulfilled (Table 5)
This cash assistance is the incentive for participant households to access basic health and education services
If participant households do not fulfill this commitment, the amount of assistance provided will be reduced in stages or even halted altogether
PKH assistance is provided through the mother or adult female who has responsibility for the children of the PKH participant household
Assistance is distributed via the post office once every four months or three times per year
Assistance will be provided for a maximum of six years
The experience of similar programs in other countries shows that after five to six years, the quality of life of participants can improve
For that reason, there is an evaluation of the participant's status every three years
If after six years the PKH participant households still live below the poverty line, an exit strategy for the relevant household needs to be coordinated with other associated programs
The organizational structure for the delivery of PKH includes several agencies such as the Coordinating Ministry for Peoples' Welfare, Ministry of Social Affairs, Bappenas, Ministry of National Education, Ministry of Health, and BPS
At each level of government from the center to the kecamatan, there is a management unit (Unit Pengelola PKH—UPPKH) that, among its tasks, has to ensure the successful delivery of the program in accordance with its plan, resolve problems that arise, and distribute information to relevant stakeholders
The UPPKH is located in the Ministry of Social Affairs and Social Agencies
The UPPKH at the kecamatan level is the spearhead of the program because this unit has a direct relationship with PKH participants
Its personnel consist of PKH mentors who are recruited from amongst community social workers, youth groups, development activist scholars, or other social organizations
They are recruited by the UPPKH at the central level and provided with training in undertaking the task of mentoring the program recipient community and assisting in the smooth operation of PKH
The mentoring is in the form of motivating recipients to utilize health and education facilities that have been provided by the government
In 2007, PKH was introduced in seven pilot provinces
West Sumatra, DKI Jakarta, West Java, East Java, North Sulawesi, Gorontalo, and NTT
These provinces were selected on the basis of the willingness of the provincial government as expressed at the Musrenbangnas (National Development Planning Consultative Forum) 2006 and the diversity of regional characteristics 
the high/medium/low level of poverty; urban/rural; coastal/ archipelagic; and easy/difficult accessibility
Of these seven provinces, 48 kabupaten/kota and 337 kecamatan were selected on the basis of the high level of poverty, rate of malnutrition, transition rate from primary/Islamic primary schools to junior high/Islamic junior high school, availability of health and education infrastructure, and commitment of the regional government
In 2008, the number of PKH regions was increased with a focus on regions that experienced disasters
The additional provinces covered Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam, North Sumatra, DI Yogyakarta, Banten, NTB, and South Kalimantan
In 2009, no additional provinces or kabupaten/kota were added, so the number was the same as in 2008—13 provinces and 70 kabupaten/kota
An additional 150 kecamatan were, however, added to the existing 631 kecamatan in the program in 2008, raising the number to 781 kecamatan
The number of RTSM participating in PKH has risen from year to year
In 2007, there were 500,000 PKH participant RTSM, rising to 700,000 in 2008, and 720,000 in 2009
The number of RTSM participants that were determined by the UPPKH at the central level was still far below the number of target households in the program plan (see Table 4)
Basic data on RTSM participants was obtained from the results of the BPS data collection exercise in PSE- 05 which was then verified through SPDKP 2007
3.2.7 Loans for Small-scale Businesses (KUR) 
KUR was launched by the government on November 5, 2007 as a means to encourage the banking sector to direct credit or funding to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (UMKM) and cooperatives
The launch of KUR was a continuation of the government's commitment to triggering increased access by UMKM and cooperatives to bank credits or loans by increasing the capacity of guarantying companies
The last objective of KUR is to improve economic conditions, reduce poverty, and absorb labor
The delivery of KUR involves various parties
Several ministries and departments have a role as policymaking and coordinating bodies
Perum Sarana Pengembangan Usaha and PT Asuransi Kredit Indonesia (Askrindo) are the guarantying companies, while Bank BRI, Bank Mandiri, Bank BNI, Bank BTN, Bank Bukopin, and Bank Syariah Mandiri are the executing banks
In general, KUR applies the loan scheme as follows
a) the maximum loan value is Rp500 million per debtor; 
b) the maximum interest on loans is an effective 16% per year; 
c) the division of risk on loan guarantee is 70% guarantying companies and 30% executing banks; 
d) assessing the credit worthiness of the borrower is the responsibility of the executing banks; and 
e) debtors are not levied guarantying service fees
KUR is basically a funding facility that can be accessed by UMKM and cooperatives, especially those that have businesses that are worthy but not yet bankable
This means that the business has good prospects and the capacity to repay a loan but does not have sufficient collateral as required by banking regulations
UMKM and cooperatives that are able to access KUR are those that operate in the productive business sector, such as agriculture, maritime and fisheries, industry, forestry, and savings and loan services
UMKM and cooperatives can access KUR directly at a branch office or assistant branch office of the executing bank
To increase accessibility, especially for micro businesses, KUR can also be accessed indirectly through micro-finance institutions (lembaga keuangan mikro—LKM), savings and loan cooperatives (koperasi simpan pinjam—KSP), and cooperatives' savings and loan business unit (usaha simpan pinjam—USP) or via other linkage program activities that are collaborating with the executing banks
The flowchart of the management or disbursement of KUR funding is broadly presented in Figure 4
3.3 Social Protection Program at the Regional Level 
To realize one objective of regional autonomy policy—improving the welfare of the local community—many regions are pursuing local social protection policies that complement national policies of the same type
Many of these policies are local initiatives and only operate in the relevant region
The following is an analysis of local social protection policies in the study areas
Education Sector 
To improve access to quality education for all levels of society, the Government of Kabupaten Muba has, since 2002, applied a number of local policies in the education sector
These policies include
(i) free schooling from the primary level to senior high school (sekolah menengah atas—SMA) or vocational high school (sekolah menengah kejuruan—SMK) in public or private schools, including religious and sporting schools; (ii) provision of free text books, reference books, and writing books; (iii) betterment of teachers' quality by mandatory free lectures to achieving qualification at the D2 and S1 levels; and (iv) development of education equipment and infrastructure
The Free Schooling Program is provided in the form of a subsidy to replace BP3 (biaya penunjang penyelenggaraan pendidikan—education operational cost) and routine funding assistance for schools
The replacement subsidy for BP3 is allocated to schools on the basis of student numbers
Preschools/kindergartens receive Rp10,000, primary schools/Islamic primary schools (MI) Rp10,000, junior high schools/Islamic junior high schools (MTs) Rp15,000, senior high schools/Islamic senior high schools (madrasah aliah— MA) Rp80,000, and vocational high schools Rp90,000 per student per month
Routine funding assistance of Rp200,000 per month is provided to primary schools, Rp6,450,000 for junior high schools, Rp13,000,000 for senior high schools and Rp19,950,000 for vocational high schools
Since 2006, the Government of Kabupaten Banjar has also allocated quite a large volume of funds to supplement BOS funds in the form of the Regional Education Operational Assistance Program (Program Bantuan Operasional Pendidikan Daerah—BOPD)
This assistance is provided to schools from primary level to senior high school, including pesantren14
The amount of funding provided ranges from Rp6,000 per student per month for primary schools to Rp10,000 for junior high schools and Rp5,000 for senior high schools
In addition to assistance from the central and regional governments, scholarships are also provided in both kabupaten by the National Foster Parents Movement (Gerakan Nasional Orang Tua Asuh—GNOTA)
Scholarships of Rp360,000/student/year are allocated for poor students at the primary school or the equivalent level
Health Sector 
To supplement the health insurance and assistance already provided to participants through Health Cards/Askeskin/Jamkesmas, Jamsostek (Jaminan Sosial Tenaga Kerja—Employees' Social Security), and Health Insurance for Civil Servants (Asuransi Kesehatan Pegawai Negeri Sipil—Askes PNS), the Government of Kabupaten Muba has had a Universal Health Insurance (Asuransi Kesehatan Semesta—Askes Semesta) policy since 2002
Under this policy, all levels of the society in Muba are provided with free health services in all available health facilities
If the local health facility is not able to successfully treat a patient, the local government will refer the patient to a hospital in Palembang, Jakarta, or even Singapore
In such cases, the local government takes responsibility for all costs, including the costs to transport the patient and one other accompanying person
In addition, the Government of Kabupaten Muba also provides health insurance for village officials (Askes ALBA) and Echelon II officials (Askes GOLD)
The Government of Kabupaten Banjar has also devoted quite a lot of attention to the health sector through the provision of a Regional Health Insurance Scheme (Program Jaminan Kesehatan Daerah—Jamkesda) since 2006
This program provides free services by focusing on 11 types of services from the village level to hospital
Through the provision of this program to complement the Jamkesmas program, all levels of society can receive guaranteed free medications and treatment in puskesmas
Free services at puskesmas were initially only provided during normal working hours; however, since 2008 this has been expended to 24 hours per day
For the poor who are not participants in Jamkesmas, in particular, the types of free services that are provided by the local government had been extended in parallel with the increases in funding allocations
Since the end of 2009, through the collaboration between Jamkesda and the Provincial Health Insurance Scheme (Jaminan Kesehatan Provinsi—Jamkesprov) by the province, the poor in Kabupaten Banjar who are not participating in Jamkesmas have the right to free medical treatment and medications up to referral hospitals in the kabupaten and province
Other Sectors 
In addition to the health and education sectors, each of the study kabupaten also have local policies to deliver social protection in other fields, such as the provision of death benefits and producing free identity cards (kartu tanda penduduk—KTP)
Kabupaten Muba also has the policies of providing driver's licenses (surat izin mengemudi—SIM) at no cost and covering the administrative costs of first marriages
Several other local policies in Kabupaten Banjar that are aimed at improving welfare and social protection, both those provided by the local government and private parties, cover the following programs
a) Village-owned Enterprise (Badan Usaha Milik Desa—BUMDes)
In order to empower economy in rural communities, the Government of Kabupaten Banjar in 2007 created BUMDes Barakat Bersama that is located at the kecamatan level
The BUMDes was established to anticipate the free market in 2010 as well as to create entrepreneurs and work opportunities in the village
The business activities undertaken include credit services for production means, agricultural production, trade in agricultural products, and other businesses or activities that are consistent with the needs and potential of the village
The local government allocated a budget of Rp10 million per village as seed funding, provides assistance in the form of agricultural machinery, and expects the village to provide matching funds
b) Community-based Savings and Loan Institution Program (Program Lembaga Simpan Pinjam Berbasis Masyarakat—LSPBM)
This program has been underway since 2001 with funds coming from soft loans provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
LSPBM operate in the savings and loans sector for the community and are only found in a few villages
Their formation and activities are under the control of the kabupaten Social Affairs Agency
c) Compensation Programs for the Communities of Coal Mining Areas
Several coal mining companies usually provide compensation or assistance, either regularly or incidentally, to communities near mining locations
This compensation or assistance is provided in the form of fees or “dust money” for the village community and administration in accordance with agreement between them, the provision of honorarium to teachers in pesantren/madrasa, orphan benefits, contributions for various activities, clean water, and development as well as the repair and renovation of infrastructure
IV
A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE IMPLEMENTATION AND ROLE OF SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMS AND OTHER POLICIES 
4.1 PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan 
In Kabupaten Muba and Kabupaten Banjar, the implementation of PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan has been ongoing since 2007
These two kabupaten had previously been participating in the Kecamatan Development Program (PPK), which was the predecessor to PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan, since 1998
Both kabupaten also have other PNPM, namely PNPM-Inti consisting of PNPM Perkotaan, PPIP, and PISEW; as well as PNPM-Penguatan that consists of Pamsimas and PUAP
The number of kecamatan in the PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan in these two kabupaten has risen
In 2007, there were five kecamatan in Kabupaten Banjar participating in PNPM, a number that rose to seven in 2008 and ten in 2009
In Kabupaten Muba, the respective numbers were four, five and seven in 2007, 2008 and 2009 respectively
This increase in the number of kecamatan was accompanied by a significant increase in the budget at the central level—from Rp1.841 trillion in 2007 to Rp4.284 trillion in 2008 and Rp6.987 trillion in 2009 (see Table 1 in Subchapter 3.2.1)
4.1.1 Program Budget Funds for PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan comes from both the national and regional budgets in the form of BLM and deconcentration funds
BLM funds are used to fund project activities and deconcentration funds are used to fund the costs of consultants, facilitators, and other supporting office activities
To fund the cost of operational management, there is a maximum allocation of 5% from BLM funds, with 2% for the operational costs of UPK at the kecamatan level and 3% for the operational costs of the activity management team (tim pengelola kegiatan—TPK) at the village level
In addition to funds from the BLM, PNPM operational activities at the kecamatan level are also supported by subsidies from the central government in the form of activity operational funds (dana operasional kegiatan—DOK) that are used for planning and training
Table 6 provides an example of the allocation of BLM funds in Kabupaten Muba for budget year 2008
Funding allocations for kabupaten vary across kabupaten and years, depending on the number of executing kecamatan recommended by the kabupaten and agreed by the central government.
The regional budget allocation for the BLM, that is 20%−50% by regulation, also varies between kabupaten and across years
For example, in Kabupaten Banjar in 2007, there were Rp5.7 billion in BLM funds available, with 60% coming from the national budget and 40% from the regional budget
In 2008, the BLM allocation rose to Rp14.5 billion with equal contributions of 50% from the national and regional budgets
In 2009, the BLM allocation fell to only Rp9 billion and the contribution from the regional budget also fell to only 20%
At the kecamatan level, the allocation of BLM funds for all kecamatan across Indonesia was determined uniformly; however, it has changed from year to year
Each executing kecamatan received Rp1.25 billion in 2007, Rp3 billion in 2008, and only Rp900 million in 2009
BLM funds from the regional budget were disbursed simultaneously, while funds from the national budget were distributed in three tranches
A disbursement of funds in each phase was only made after 90% of the activities in the preceding phase had been completed
Requests for a release of funds is submitted by the UPK at the kecamatan level and the funds are transferred to the UPK account
Ant then, the UPK will direct these funds to the TPK at the village level in stages in accordance with the plan and level of activity completion
Behind these budget allocation figures, there are several problems related to budget governance
For example, in the third week of October 2009, all APBD funds had been released by Kabupaten Banjar for PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan 2009; however, the allocation from the national budget had not yet been released
According to information from a number of sources, this occurred because there were still many kabupaten in South Kalimantan that had yet completed certain activities in PNPM 2009 according to schedule
For example, some kabupaten had still not implemented MAD III
The same situation occurred in Kabupaten Muba; in mid-October 2009, not all kecamatan had conducted MAD III
A similar condition will probably result in delays in the overall schedule for implementing projects
4.1.2 Program Governance Practices at the Village and Community Levels 
In general, development activities being conducted with the framework of PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan consist of two types of activities 
development of infrastructure to support economic, health, and education activities as well as women's savings and loans activities (simpan pinjam perempuan—SPP)
As a program that follows a bottom up development process, PNPM tries to the extent possible to avoid a process of instructional determination of activities
Determining and implementing activities originated from intensive discussion and debate on community proposals at the lowest administrative level—the RT or dusun
These proposals then become the basis for formulation at the village level through a village consultative forum (musyawarah desa— musdes)
In addition to providing a forum to decide on proposals for activities (a maximum of three proposals), the musdes is also a forum to determine six people who will become the village's representatives in the MAD forum at the kecamatan level
The are two types of consultative forum at the village level, special village consultative forum for women and mixed consultative forum (for men and women)
A special consultative forum for women is recommended to consider two proposals, namely a proposal for an SPP activity and that for the development of physical infrastructure
A mixed village consultative forum only has the right to submit one kind of activity proposal in the form of developing physical infrastructure
Each village brings these three proposals to the MAD forum at the kecamatan level
In the MAD forum that is held in three phases, all proposals from all villages that participate in the PNPM will be discussed, assessed, and finally decided
The winners of this proposal competition will then receive PNPM funds
In general, many parties, especially at the kecamatan and village levels, consider the process for determining PNPM activities to be too long and to take too much time and energy
The process can take several months from the collection of proposals at the community level to the determination of the winners at the MAD forum
And then there is the wait for the funds to be disbursed
Nevertheless, this mechanism is acknowledged as an effective means to grow community participation and initiative in the process or implementation of development activities in their village
Unfortunately, optimizing this role of the community is sometimes not fully supported by the program manager or implementer
This is evident from cases where the kecamatan has intervened to allocate infrastructure development activities to every village to avoid the emergence of intervillage jealousies
In addition, there have been cases of certain individuals being appointed (contractors) as the infrastructure project implementer by the village-level manager without going through a consultation at the community level (elite capture)
In fact, there is an infrastructure project that is being done by a contractor and workers from outside the kecamatan with no involvement from the local community
If we look at the nature of the activity, the local community is probably capable of doing the work because they are only a small concrete bridge construction approximately four meters in length and the installation of a storing place for clean water
The implementation mechanism of PNPM which is quite long, has many requirements, and is quite competitive has given rise to disappointments and dissatisfaction in the community and amongst officials
The problem becomes increasingly complicated when funding disbursements from the national budget are often late
Such disappointments appear to have an element of truth because activity proposals that win tend to be determined by the skill of the argument for the project and are not based on the urgency of the activity for the interests of the local community
This phenomenon of community disappointment with the PNPM mechanism is caused by at least two issues
Firstly, the community itself is not mentally ready to conduct a competitive bottom up development process
The top-down development process that they have been used to for dozens of years is normal and is still deeply rooted
Secondly, the party responsible for the PNPM at the lowest level has not provided sufficient publicity on the “rules of the game” and/or consequences of their participation in the PNPM activities
There is still inadequate emphasis given to the risk that activity proposals will be rejected
As a result of these disappointments, some villages do not submit proposals of activities or are not willing to participate in the implementation of the next PNPM
the process is too long, nobody in the community is willing to be the activity manager, or they would like to provide the opportunity to other villages
It is estimated that the number of villages not submitting activity proposals will rise as funding allocations to kecamatan fell in 2009
All activities are expected to be participatory, fair, and transparent; however, in practice at the community level, not all the proposals and implementation of activities can run effectively
The implementation of programs, commencing from socialization to activity implementation, is quite varied
On the one hand, there are villages that are idealistic in implementing activities in accordance with regulations, while, on the other hand, there are practices that breach regulations
Some socialization of the programs at the village/dusun/RT level, for example, is undertaken by inviting all villagers, while some others are limited only to the community elite such as village officials, RT heads, dusun heads, and community figures
The involvement of villagers in physical development activities also varies
There are villages that offer work to all villagers; however, there are also villages that only involve a group of people who are related to the village head/dusun head/RT head or activity manager
As the implementation of the programs varies, the view of the community towards the PNPM also varies
Several parties state that all aspects of the management of PNPM are very good, be it the implementing organization, community participation, objectives of the activities, or quality of work done
However, others state that the implementation of PNPM tends to be dominated by the village elite or people who have a close relationship with the village elite
Even though villagers attend meetings to discuss the PNPM, their attendance is only a formality
The activities that will be suggested have already been predetermined by the village officials, so the community is just there to concur
The following statement by a respondent is an example
“We were once invited to attend a meeting to discuss proposals for the PNPM, but everything had already been determined
More often than not, we remained silent
After that, we were never involved or invited back” (Husein (not his real name), male, 49, Kabupaten Muba, October 16, 2009)
In fact, there are more than a few community members who do not know the implementation of the activity, although the location of the development activity is not far from their house
They only know that the project is a PNPM project
They do not know who is managing the project or what the budget is
For that reason, it is not surprising that there is a perception that the implementation of the PNPM is tainted by nepotism
Such practices then give rise to suspicions that funds are siphoned off from the development activities
Perceptions or speculation such as this arise because transparency and accountability that are the bases for PNPM have not been fully implemented
In some villages, the information board is installed in a strategic place, so the community can access it easily
In fact, to clarify the aspects of transparency and accountability, there is a monitoring team at the village level whose tasks are to directly supervise the work and evaluate the management of the activity
However, some other villages do not do this
In study villages in Kabupaten Banjar, for example, there is no information board about the PNPM
Even at the kecamatan level, an information board that should be used for the PNPM is used to announce other matters that have absolutely no connection to the PNPM
There are quite a large number of infrastructure development activities that are not completed on time
In Muba, approximately 30% of activities are not completed in the same budget year
In Kabupaten Banjar, there are outstanding activities from PNPM 2007 that had not been completed in September 2009
Some of the reasons for these delays include the long process of proposal and determination of the activities, delays in BLM funds from the national budget, and weather problems
In addition, in several villages in Banjar, there have been problems with the supply of raw materials because the relevant villages have not received the raw materials that they ordered, even though they have paid for them
It is predicted that the same problems will be repeated with PNPM 2009 because delays in the disbursement of funds from the national budget mean that there is a more limited amount of time to execute projects
In addition, the funding disbursement which is expected in November and December coincides with the height of the wet season which will make it difficult to work in the field and add to the workload
There are concerns that this will have an impact on the quality of the outcome and program activities
Although national budget funds have not been disbursed, many villages have started to implement their infrastructure development activities by using third party funds or community funds
They are doing this because they are sure that APBN funds will eventually be released
However, because the release of funds is delayed longer than predicted, many activities cannot be continued
In one village, the cessation of these activities has left a debt owing to workers whose wages have not yet been paid
4.1.3 Benefits of PNPM and Its Role in Responding to the Impact of the GFC
In general, the community suggested physical development activities to fulfill basic infrastructure needs such as roads; bridges; bathing, washing, and toilet facilities (mandi, cuci, and kakus—MCK); and clean water
In accordance with the limitations of the proposal process for activities, which by design place women as the dominant stakeholders, it is not surprising if the majority of proposals come from women and in the form of SPP proposals
a) Physical Development Activities The majority of funds (75%) available under PNPM are used for labor-intensive and selfmanaging physical infrastructure development
Through such schemes, it is expected that a lot of labor, especially from the poor, will be employed
Nevertheless, the ability of PNPM to employ labor is considered to vary across regions, even across villages, because it is dependent on the scale of community involvement
Respondents in several villages stated that PNPM activities have quite a significant capacity to employ workers
To harden a pathway to the plantation, for example, it required the equivalent of 900 person-days
However, respondents in other villages consider that PNPM does not employ a lot of labor on activities because the local community are only involved as workers on hardening some village streets and the project only employs around ten workers over 30 days
The construction of some other village streets, a bridge, and a storing place for clean water is done by a contractor
In fact, the construction of the bridge only involves three workers who come from outside the village
The presence of PNPM is generally quite beneficial even though it is only temporary—that is, for as long as the physical development process (which is in general two to five months)—and only employs limited numbers of workers
In study villages in Muba, PNPM provides wages in accordance with local standards, namely Rp80,000 per day for masons and carpenters and Rp60,000 per day for the assistants with an eight-hour working day
In one study village in Kabupaten Banjar, wages were set at Rp30,000 per day for female workers and Rp40,000 per day for men
In addition to providing employment opportunities, PNPM activities are also able to contribute to get the wheels of the local economy moving, although only to a limited extent
Approximately 40% of PNPM project material is sourced locally, including rocks, gravel, sand, and timber, so PNPM has provided an economic stimulus for the local economy
From the perspective of direct poverty reduction, the role of PNPM is less than optimal
Not all workers who are involved in constructing physical infrastructure are poor
Quite a number of community members are not poor, including village officials who have been employed on these projects
This community group generally has a close relationship with village officials and/or PNPM managers in the village
Given that not all of them are used to hard or bluecollar work, the quantity and quality of work is less than good
What is of more concern is that some of them come to the project location only to sign the attendance list, get their hands a little dirty, or act like a foreman
Based on this reality, the role of PNPM in alleviating the impact of the GFC in the study areas, especially for the poor which is the group hardest hit, is minimal
This is also related to the tightness of the internal program mechanism and the limited funds
In addition, other factors such as limited employment opportunities, late funding disbursements, and implementation time that is brief and is not coinciding with the crisis contribute to have an impact on the responsiveness of PNPM
The design character of the PNPM that tends to strengthen community institutions makes them less than capable of lessening the impact of the global crisis
Nevertheless, infrastructure development activities have contributed to the construction or improvement in the quality of existing infrastructure at the village level
In general, the community believes that physical infrastructure development has provided a clear benefit, such as making travel easier and shortening the time it takes to reach the plantation, the marketplace, and the health and education facilities
In addition, it has brought clean water closer to home
Given that the type of projects undertaken under the PNPM are those that the community itself wants, then normatively the effectiveness and sense of belonging of the community for these facilities should be high
Several facilities can be used to their maximum extent by involving the community members through the fees that they determine together
One business activity providing a makeup service for brides in one village that was funded by PNPM through skills training and the procurement of equipment has also developed quite well
However, not all PNPM projects have the same success story
In the study areas, the outcome of several physical development activities can no longer be used
In fact, there are facilities that could only be used during the pilot phase
This occurred because the quality of construction work was inadequate and it was not maintained
b) Women's Savings and Loans Activities (SPP) PNPM has given special priority to SPP activities that are allocated a maximum of 25% of the funding
The BLM budget disbursed has to be allocated firstly for SPP projects before being allocated to physical infrastructure developments
In Kabupaten Banjar, for example, when BLM funds from the APBN 2009 had not been disbursed, all the funds from the regional budget in September were used for SPP projects
Through the SPP program, PNPM provides relatively low interest loans to women, at around 18% interest per year
In general, SPP activities are felt to be more helpful in alleviating the impact of the GFC because funds from PNPM 2008 fell at the onset of the crisis
SPP also has a role in developing economic activities although the number of borrowers and the size of loans is limited
In general, borrowers use the loan funds to add capital to their existing business or open a new business
Respondents who have been members of SPP, generally consider that their involvement in these activities has provided a significant benefit in their family's economic development
In the context of PNPM as a poverty reduction program, SPP activities have not entirely met their target
This has occurred because most of the SPP participants are community members who have businesses and are not poor
In limited numbers, there are also poor community members who have been able to access SPP; however, their loans have been relatively smaller than those who are better-off and have businesses
In several villages, there has been significant intervention by village officials, especially in determining those community members who have the right to receive loans
Village officials and SPP managers tend to provide loans to community members who have significant potential to repay their loan
The reason is that SPP is a form of loan that has joint responsibility and the performance of SPP (only in terms of the level of repayment) will determine the opportunity to obtain another PNPM project
What is important for them is that SPP loan repayments are made regularly and do not go into arrears, so they ignore aspects of economic empowerment for the poor
The emphasis of SPP activities on the repayment of loans shows a satisfying outcome
In Kecamatan Sekayu, Kabupaten Muba, as of August 2009, the repayment rate on SPP loans had reached 97% (UPK Kecamatan Sekayu, October 13, 2009)
In Kecamatan Simpang Empat, Kabupaten Banjar, SPP loans from PNPM 2007 have been fully repaid and for SPP loans from PNPM 2008, only three villages have not fully repaid loans
In fact, in this kecamatan, there are Rp530 million in SPP funds circulating
Given this repayment performance, the local UPK is very confident that the SPP will develop and they hope that the SPP can become a savings and loan unit that can be relied on by the community as well as be a source of income for its managers
4.2 Other Social Protection Programs 
4.2.1 Rice for Poor Households (Raskin) 
Food shortages for the poor are a certainty, especially when there are shocks such as when harvest fails, supplies of rice in the market are disrupted, the price of rice rises, or there are other economic crises
In such circumstances, food assistance programs for poor households are very much needed and are a must
The initial objective of the Raskin program was to reduce the impact of the economic crisis of 1997/98 and later evolved into a routine assistance program in the food sector for poor households
In accordance with its objectives, this program is a targeted subsidy assistance program, not a general subsidy program
Such programs are considered to be more cost effective than general price subsidy models
For that reason, the poor should have exclusive rights to receive Raskin rice
In the study locations, the distribution of Raskin rice from Bulog to the distribution point, which is located in the kecamatan office, occurs every month and the volume is in accordance with the predetermined standard
Nevertheless, at the request of village stakeholders, not all villages receive an allocation of Raskin rice every month
When the rice harvesting season is underway for approximately two months, there are villages who do not take their allocation because they are concerned that it will be difficult to distribute it, so the village only takes an allocation of Raskin rice for ten months each year
The distribution of Raskin rice from the distribution point to the community is generally managed or is the responsibility of the RT head and/or the village head
They collect the rice at the distribution point and then distribute it to their community
This kind of rice distribution method at the village or RT level is the authority of each respective implementer
For that reason, the pattern of distribution of Raskin rice varies quite significantly, both between RT and between villages as follows
(i) rice is shared equally to all interested villagers without differentiating between the poor and nonpoor; (ii) rice is shared in turns to all interested villagers; (iii) rice is shared equally only to all those households that are considered to be poor, although not all of them are registered as target recipients; and (iv) rice is shared in turn only to all of those households that are considered to be poor
With such practices, poor households are not receiving their right in accordance with regulations
Almost all recipient respondents are not receiving rice routinely each month in the amount of 15 kg
Some respondents are receiving 15 kg once every two to six months, but there are also some who are receiving five to ten kg once every one to six months
In fact, there are also respondents who only received one allocation during the 2009 distribution that was operating for ten months
In addition to being influenced by the Raskin distribution pattern that is determined by program managers at the RT or village level, variations in the amount of rice received by respondent households are also affected by other factors
Several poor households did not always redeem their allocation of Raskin rice every time there was a distribution because they did not have sufficient cash
Uncertainty about when the allocation was due caused this situation to arise
Several households were sometimes late to know that Raskin rice had arrived, so when they wanted to take their allocation, the rice was already gone
There are also cases of households not being aware at all that Raskin rice had arrived because information was only passed by word of mouth
Recipient households did not redeem Raskin rice at the set price of Rp1,600 per kg
This happened because Raskin rice was generally not shared out at the distribution point, so recipient households had to incur the cost of transport from the distribution point to the allocation point (RT/village) and an honorarium for the distributing official
In general, recipient households paid Rp2,000–Rp3,000 per kg for their allocation of Raskin rice
This price was determined by the manager at the RT or village level according to the distance from the distribution point to the allocation point
This price was usually determined according to the general price of supplies at the kecamatan level
Recipient households often received poorer quality rice that smelt, had a dry taste or dull color, or was infested with insects
For that reason, recipients usually treated it when they cooked it by using a pandanus leaf, mixing it with better quality rice that they purchased at a small shop, or washed it with hot water
Although the quality was less than good, Raskin rice that was distributed was always taken and eaten because the community needed inexpensive rice
This kind of information shows that the implementation of the Raskin program has generally been distorted
The most prominent issue that needs to be highlighted is that this program has lost its most important attribute, namely “poor households” as the program target
It seems that the Raskin program has changed into a program that sells subsidized rice to anyone without paying attention to the program's regulations
There is also some information that to a certain extent, deviations in allocations occurred because, among other reasons, BPS data as the basis for determining the targets was less than accurate
For that reason, village officials then took a policy decision to correct data errors by allocating Raskin rice in accordance with local poverty conditions
Unfortunately, such corrections did not rely on correct methods such as verifying the data through a village consultative forum, but were based on individual decisions by village officials
Furthermore, for pragmatic reasons, village officials then allocated the Raskin rice to households that are not classified as poor
What is heartbreaking is that some of those nonpoor households demanded a share of Raskin rice, not because they needed it but for trivial reasons such as “We also want some government assistance” or “We also need and eat rice”
Even more ironically, some nonpoor households purchase Raskin rice not for household food needs, but to use as chickenfeed
A practice of distributing Raskin rice that makes it possible for managers to adapt it to local conditions—even if it is not in accordance with regulations—should be capable of being used to respond to various socioeconomic changes or shocks that occur at the community level
However, this possibility was not utilized by implementing officials when the GFC occurred even though there are many communities that have been affected by the GFC
Implementing officials only managed the program in accordance with the regulations that they normally followed without any adjustments at all
Although there have been a number of weaknesses in its implementation, the Raskin program has generally been quite helpful for the community in economizing on life's costs with a role that varied significantly between recipient households
Although the price of rice could go as high as Rp3,000 per kg, this price was still far below the market price that ranged from Rp4,000–Rp6,500 per kg
The potential benefits of the program could even be higher if more attention was given to poor households and distributions were more regular, so poor households had more certainty with subsidized supplies and had more opportunity to prepare the funds to purchase Raskin rice
4.2.2 Education Sector 
To conduct teaching and learning activities, schools in the study areas receive funding assistance from both the central government and the local kabupaten
All schools at the primary and junior high school levels, especially public schools, receive funding from the central government through the BOS program
BOS funds are obtained through a managing bank each quarter of the school year in accordance with program stipulations, namely on the basis of an allocation per student and the number of students in the relevant school
Based on the number of students in primary/Islamic primary/equivalent schools and junior/Islamic junior high/equivalent schools, total BOS funding received by schools in Kabupaten Muba in 2009 reached Rp45.7 billion, while the corresponding amount in Kabupaten Banjar was Rp14.6 billion
This allocation was 13% and 20% of the total funding available to the education sector in Kabupaten Muba and Kabupaten Banjar respectively
From the structure of the regional budget, it is known that these two study kabupaten have made quite serious efforts to raise the quality of education and education service
This is evident from the increase in the proportion of the regional budget allocated to education
During the 2007–2009 period, the proportion of the APBD allocated to the education sector in Kabupaten Muba rose from 22.7% to 24.23% and finally to 26.17%
APBD allocations to the education sector in Kabupaten Banjar during the 2006–2008 period rose from 21.7% to 24.68% and finally to 29.73%
In nominal terms, the budget allocation to education in Kabupaten Muba (more than Rp300 billion) was higher than the allocation in Kabupaten Banjar (approximately Rp200 billion)
This education budget is allocated, among other ways, in the form of cash for each school to undertake teaching and learning activities
Schools in Kabupaten Muba receive funds from the Free Schooling Program that, inter alia, come in the form of a replacement subsidy for the BP3 and routine funding assistance for schools
Schools in Kabupaten Banjar receive BOPD
Funding disbursements for the BP3 replacement funds in Kabupaten Muba and the BPOD in Kabupaten Banjar are made every three months
In Kabupaten Muba, funds are collected by the school principal or his/her deputy at the office of the local Education Agency, while in Kabupaten Banjar, funds are collected at the BPD Bank
These funds are then managed autonomously by each respective school
Based on the number of students, it is estimated that the budget allocation by the Government of Kabupaten Muba for the BP3 replacement funds is approximately Rp31.6 billion per year
The Government of Kabupaten Banjar allocated Rp6.3 billion in funding for BPOD on the initial launch of the program in 2006, an amount that rose to Rp6.5 billion in 2007, Rp8 billion in 2008, and Rp10.5 billion in 2009
This budget increase is consistent with the rise in the number of students
Scholarship assistance of Rp360,000 per student per year is provided to poor students in both kabupaten by GNOTA
The number of students in receipt of these scholarships is very limited
For example, in one sample primary school, scholarships are only provided to 13.5% of the 207 students and in one other primary school, only 3.2% of 311 students
Determining the students who will receive assistance is done by the school by considering those students who come from poor households or are orphans, or whose parents have many children
In general, students who are chosen receive full scholarships via the school
In Kabupaten Muba, in particular, assistance is also provided in the form of money for food for all education workers, including the principal, teachers, library officials, and school security guards
Rp15,000/person/work day over 22 days per month
The BOS program that is supported by education funding assistance from the local government provides broader opportunities to children of school age to enjoy a free education service
In Kabupaten Muba, free schooling can be enjoyed by all students in primary up to senior high schools or equivalent
In fact, in this kabupaten, a polytechnic building that will deliver free lectures commencing in the School Year 2010 has been constructed
In Kabupaten Banjar, free education can be enjoyed by students in public primary and junior high schools and their Islamic counterparts, while students from private counterparts as well as senior high schools only receive a reduction in the cost of education
In general, with these programs, community awareness and motivation to send children to school is much better
The level of dropouts is relatively low; in fact, this rarely occurs
The transition rate to junior high school or pesantren is also high
These programs have the ability to reduce the burden on the community, especially on the poor, especially during times of crisis
Many citizens acknowledge that if these programs were not available, it is quite possible that their children would not be able to continue their schooling and would have to dropout after completing primary school
Schools also acknowledge that the teaching and learning process runs more smoothly because schools can benefit directly from BOS funds and the funds that are provided by local governments to purchase consumable study materials, student worksheets, and teaching and learning supplies and equipment as well as to fund training or teachers' work activities
Nevertheless, in accessing education facilities, there are still many communities, especially the poor, who are inhibited by the cost of transport to the location of the school
Students in senior high schools feel this the most because the number of education facilities at this level is still limited and schools are usually only available in the kecamatan capital
In fact, quality senior high schools are usually only found in the kabupaten capital
From a number of interviews, information was obtained that parents who do not have their own transport have to outlay Rp7,000–Rp10,000 for the cost of transport every day
For rubber tappers, this is equivalent to 30% of their daily income
4.2.3 Health Sector As was explained in Subchapter 3.3, the effort to improve health services in the two study kabupaten is undertaken through the Jamkesmas program and regional government programs
The regional health service program in Kabupaten Muba is known by the name of Askes Semesta, while in Kabupaten Banjar, it is known under the name Jamkesda
These two health service programs that were initiated by these local governments are intended to anticipate the limited number of targets under the Jamkesmas program that only covers the poor in limited target numbers
With the availability of Jamkesmas and Askes Semesta, supported by various other health insurance programs such as Askes for Officials (Askes Aparat), Askes PNS, and Jamsostek, the whole community in Kabupaten Muba can receive free health services at various levels of community health facilities, starting from secondary health centers (puskesmas pembantu or pustu) through to public hospitals at the provincial level
In fact, the community can request free medications at the Cipto Mangunkusumo hospital (RSCM) in Jakarta or hospitals in Singapore if the regional hospital is not able to treat them
According to data from the Health Agency in Kabupaten Muba, 66.4% of the 545,697 people living in this kabupaten are covered by Askes Semesta
This is more than the coverage in the Jamkesmas program (26.6%), Askes Aparat (1%), Askes PNS (3.1%), and Jamsostek (3.8%)
In Kabupaten Banjar, free treatment for the entire community is limited to health services at puskesmas that have been open 24 hours per day since 2008
Free services in hospitals at the kabupaten and provincial levels are only provided to those poor participants in Jamkesmas and the poor who submit a declaration that they are not well-off
In fact, the Jamkesda service in hospitals at the provincial level has just been launched
The numbers of people covered by the Jamkesmas and Jamkesda programs are 119,309 and 46,406 people respectively
The difference in the scope of free services in these two kabupaten is consistent with differences in funding allocations provided
The Government of Kabupaten Muba allocated Rp49.6 billion in 2007 and Rp67.9 billion in 2008 for the Askes Semesta program
The Government of Kabupaten Banjar allocated Rp3.6 billion to the Jamkesda program in 2007, Rp5.1 billion in 2008, and Rp6 billion in 2009 (see Table 7)
Increased allocations in 2008 are a result of the inauguration of the free 24-hour service in puskesmas
The commitment of the governments of Kabupaten Muba and Kabupaten Banjar to providing certainty in health security for the entire community of Muba and the poor in Kabupaten Banjar should be appropriately appreciated
The community can obtain free treatment by just showing their KTP and family card (kartu keluarga, which contains information on the members of the family)
The results of interviews with several households provide that this commitment is very beneficial for the community
One village official stated, “One of my villagers was suffering from a mental illness
He was taken twice to hospital
The first time, he was treated for 18 days and on the second occasion for 12 days
Now, he is once again healthy and did not have to pay anything at all for his treatment” (male, Kabupaten Banjar, October 17, 2009)
In addition, one household respondent said, “My child died at the Sekayu Regional Hospital when he was five years of age
According to the doctor's diagnosis, he was suffering from an inflamed intestine
All the medical treatment and medications were free and we received a death benefit of Rp1.5 million from the government” (female, 45 years, Kabupaten Muba, October 16, 2009)
When the GFC occurred, these free health programs were very helpful to the community
The free services meant that those people who were generally working as farm laborers or rubber workers did not have to feel worried about the cost of medical treatment when their income fell sharply
For that reason, although a crisis was occurring, the number of patient visits to health facilities in Kabupaten Banjar tended to show no change
In one puskesmas visited, for example, the number of patient visits remained stable in the range from 30 to 40 people per day
Nevertheless, in their execution at the community level, these health services still faced obstacles
Although many people in Kabupaten Banjar stated that the accuracy of targeting by Jamkesmas was quite good, its benefits were less than maximum
Because there was very little socialization of the program, there are community members who do not know of the benefits of the Jamkesmas program
Some respondents did not look after their card and lost it, while there are also cases of patients who had to pay for the cost of expensive medical treatment because they did not use the card
In one study village, the Jamkesmas cards that had just been received in August 2009 were deliberately retained by the village officials because they were worried that they would be lost or damaged
The problem is that this initiative of retaining the cards was not publicized, so the community did not know whether they were a beneficiary of this program or not
In general, there are several obstacles that need serious attention from the management of free health service programs
Firstly, there is the problem of the cost of transport and transport facilities to reach health facilities, especially for the poor
Secondly, free services did not immediately mean a prime service
There have been a number of complaints about hospitals related to inequitable treatment of poor patients compared with the nonpoor
There were also complaints about medications that were uniform and not efficacious, or insufficient supplies of medications at the puskesmas
Thirdly, the requirement to bring a KTP card and family card to access the free service does not appear to have always been fulfilled by patients because this stipulation was not adequately publicized
There are still community members that do not have these two cards or did not bring them when they sought treatment
Fourthly, free health services still need to be supported by adequate numbers of health workers
In one puskesmas visited, two pieces of modern equipment could not be operated because there was no doctor or skilled operator
Because of these various impediments, there are still quite a number of community members who prefer to use other forms of health service although they have to pay for them
Some of them use medications purchased from small shops near their home
Some others, especially those who have sufficient funds, prefer services in medical workers' practices or from midwives
4.2.4 Direct Cash Transfers (BLT) 
In the two study kabupaten, in accordance with the results of the BPS verification, the number of target households in receipt of BLT 2009 has fallen in comparison with BLT 2008
In Kabupaten Muba, the number of target households fell from 35,515 to 34,693 (Social Affairs Agency of Kabupaten Muba, October 13, 2009), while in Kabupaten Banjar, the number of target households fell from 33,407 to 33,072 (Social Affairs Agency of Kabupaten Banjar, October 20, 2009)
In general, this fall is not the result of an improvement in welfare levels but is due to household targets that have died or changed address
As was mentioned by several household respondents, the initial process for selecting BLT recipient households involved village officials
Respondents did not understand the detail of how the verification process operated
In general, village officials and household respondents stated that the targeting of BLT recipient households was relatively accurate
They were considered poor households or those who had the right to receive BLT funds because they were farm laborers or people who were no longer able to work productively because of their age or incapacity
Several of them have been widowed
Nevertheless, a staff member of the Bappeda office in Kabupaten Banjar estimated the potential for incorrect targeting to 20% because program managers often prioritize family members to receive benefits
Household respondents also said that there was mistargeting because there have been instances of recipients coming from relatively well-off families who already own motorcycles
In fact, there are still many poor households with poor housing conditions who are not in receipt of BLT assistance
Suspicions of mistargeting also arise because there are BPS staff who have fully delegated their responsibility for data collection or verification to village officials, especially to dusun heads
In addition to mistargeting, many respondent officials and households consider that the quota for BLT recipients is still inadequate because there are still many families who are not well-off but are not receiving benefits (undercoverage)
As was almost the same with BLT 2005 funding that was disbursed in several tranches every three months, BLT 2008 funds were disbursed in two tranches
In the first tranche, Rp300,000 was allocated for a three-month period, while in the second phase, an amount of Rp400,000 was paid for a four-month period
In BLT 2009, the funds was disbursed once at the end of February in the amount of Rp200,000 for a two-month period
During each funding disbursement, the local post office determined the schedule for disbursement for every village to avoid long queues and chaos
The disbursement process also involved the local police authorities
The funding disbursement service was centered at the kecamatan post office because they were unable to provide additional service points
This gave rise to complaints by a number of recipients who lived far form the kecamatan capital because they had to pay quite a significant amount of transport costs, that is, up to Rp35,000
In villages that were quite far away and have inadequate public transport facilities, there were instances of village officials who took the initiative to provide rented vehicles to transport BLT recipients at a relatively cheap cost
When funds were being disbursed, recipient households had to bring their KTP and BLT recipient card
By regulation, the funding disbursement could not be delegated, except for specific cases and the delegated person had to show a power of attorney or letter of introduction from a village official
In practice, delegated responsibility to collect funds could be done by just showing a KTP and BLT card without the required documentation
The person usually delegated to collect funds was the RT head or a member of the recipient family
In several places, funds collection by the RT head was hit with a levy of Rp15,000 per recipient as a substitute for the cost of transport
In several cases, the collection of funds that had been delegated to the RT head occurred at the request of the RT head himself, so he could obtain a larger payment in lieu of the cost of transport
Almost all BLT recipient respondents received a full allocation of funds without any deductions from any party
Only one case of a funding deduction was found—an elderly respondent who admitted paying an administration fee of Rp15,000 to the RT head
In general, recipient respondents used some of the BLT funds to fulfill their daily consumption needs
With the additional money from the BLT, they could improve the quality of their consumption for a few days
Some respondents also used some of the BLT funds to fulfill other needs such as medical costs, school needs, electricity bills, paying for the connection to a neighbor's electricity, additional business capital, and paying off debts
The community feels helped by the BLT funds because they have been able to lessen life's burden
Given that the BLT disbursement for BLT 2008 and BLT 2009 was done while the crisis was occurring meant that the BLT program provided a greater benefit
The cash form of assistance is also considered a strength because recipient households had greater freedom to utilize the funds in accordance with their need
Because of that, when the BLT program ceased in 2009, many community members questioned the decision and felt the loss
They hope that the BLT program will be extended, so they have an additional source of finance that can be relied on
Many government officials support the BLT program because they consider the program to have helped the poor to fulfill their needs
Nevertheless, there are also officials who have the opposite opinion because they believe the BLT program tended to spoil recipient households and make them lazy
They agree more with labor-intensive programs that are more oriented towards empowering the community
4.2.5 Family of Hope Program (PKH) 
Kabupaten Banjar is one of the pilot locations for the implementation of PKH
In 2008, PKH was instituted in nine kecamatan that were directly nominated by the central PKH team
In 2009, one additional kecamatan was added to PKH, making a total of ten kecamatan
This additional kecamatan was determined by the central PKH team after suggestions from the PKH secretariat with the agreement of BPS and the Head of the Social Affairs Agency in the kabupaten
The criteria used to select the kecamatan for the pilot were
(i) more than 600 very poor households; (ii) an incidence of malnutrition; and (iii) a poor level of education
The target households of the PKH are very poor households (RTSM) enumerated by BPS and validated by a mentor located at the kecamatan level
In general, recipient targets for the PKH in the study areas were accurate
They are classified as very poor households, such as poor widows or poor households with an uncertain income and with responsibility for school children
According to the UPPKH at the kabupaten level, data on target RTSM was updated by mentors each time there was to be a funding disbursement
The data update was done on the basis of the results of monthly meetings between the mentor and the recipient households
As a result, the number of target RTSM changed almost every time there was a disbursement
For example, during the first funding disbursement in Kabupaten Banjar in 2009, there were 4,991 target households, while this fell by 1.34% for the second disbursement to 4,924 households
This change occurred because there were RTSM who no longer met the criteria, among others, because their children had already graduated from junior high school
Nevertheless, at the kecamatan level and in the study villages, the purification of the data on target RTSM did not function as intended
This is evidenced by the number of households that did not meet the criteria but still received assistance from the PKH
In one study village, one household whose school-aged child passed away in 2008 was still receiving PKH
In another study village, one household is still receiving PKH payments although their schoolaged child was no longer attending school because she had married
The problems with the data purification of RTSM targets is closely related to problems with the operation of the mentoring activity
Mentors only came to the post office located in the kecamatan capital when a funding disbursement was underway to supervise and check the eligibility of the PKH recipient
Almost all PKH recipient respondents stated that they never met routinely with or had a visit from the mentor at their house or in the village
Only one respondent admitted being approached by the mentor
Meetings with the mentor only took place at the initial stage of the program implementation during the counseling activity which was carried out once for all the villages
The weakness of the mentoring activity was caused, inter alia, by the size of the region and the distribution of the mentored households
One mentor had the task of mentoring approximately 200 target RTSM
In the study region, one mentor had to mentor recipient households spread across 26 villages with houses spread far apart
In addition, the residence of the mentor which was not in the mentored location had an ongoing impact on the weakness of the mentoring process
The mentor in the study area came from the provincial capital which was approximately two hours by motor vehicle away
According to the kabupaten UPPKH, the mentors who were recruited and appointed by the central UPPKH should have come from the local kecamatan; however, due to a shortage of human resources to fulfill this requirement, there were mentors who came in from outside the kecamatan
The disbursement of PKH funds for target households is done every four months
An announcement about the funding disbursement is provided to the village head by the mentor
Funds can be collected during a 40-day period from the first day of disbursement
If funds are not collected within this period by the target household, the funds are returned to the State Treasury
The funds have to be collected by the wife or female household head by taking their KTP, PKH membership card, and family card
If the appropriate person can not attend, responsibility can be delegated to another family member or party by bringing a power of attorney
In 2009, there were two funding disbursements, in April and June 2009
The second disbursement was done early so that it could be done in conjunction with the start of the new school year and parents could purchase their children's school equipment
During this second funding disbursement, in Kabupaten Banjar, some funding allocations were not realized because there were recipients who did not collect their funds with the reasons that they had changed address, died, or other reasons
During the first funding disbursement, there were 45 RTSM who did not take their funds amounting to Rp16 million, while in the second disbursement, 25 RTSM did not collect Rp8.7 million in payments
Most PKH recipient respondents received payments without any deductions
They only had to pay the cost of transport which was Rp10,000−Rp35,000
In one study village, however, recipient households were asked to deposit Rp30,000 with the local RT head to cover the transport cost for collecting the invitations to disburse the PKH funds
In addition, in another study village, there were RTSM recipients who received different amounts
In the first phase, they received Rp780,000, while in the following phase, they only received Rp770,000
Although a deduction had been made, no household made an effort to find out the reason or lodge an objection
For them, being able to receive that amount of money every four months when many other households were not receiving it was a privilege, so when there was a small deduction, they did not consider it to be a problem
PKH is considered to have been quite helpful to recipient RTSM who are generally farm laborers and have been hit hard by the GFC
However, because the number of recipients is limited, the impact of the program on the community is generally not significant
In general, recipient households used the PKH funds to fulfill their children's health and education needs, by buying milk, extra food, shoes, uniforms, school equipment, and school snacks
In fact, there were also households that used the funds for daily consumption items and to pay off debts
4.2.6 Loans for Small-scale Businesses (KUR) 
As has often been reported by the media, Bank Indonesia has appealed that the channeling of KUR loans adhere to the principles of healthy credit provision
Bank Indonesia hopes that the fate of KUR does not end up the same as previous mass credit programs whose regulations were corrupted
In anticipation of this concern, implementing banks then applied tighter loanissuing procedures that mirror the normal system of commercial loans
This policy had become an obstacle to the implementation of the KUR program which is evident from a fall in the realization of credit provided
In 2008, the national target for the KUR program was Rp14.5 trillion, while the actual amount realized was Rp12.45 trillion (86%) for 1.65 million debtors or an average loan per debtor of Rp7.52 million
This means that every month more than Rp1 trillion in KUR loans were disbursed
In 2009, the level of loans realized fell dramatically
From a target of Rp20 trillion, only Rp1.9 trillion had been realized by the end of semester I, an amount that was not far different to the amount realized in a month during the previous year
Several main causes were identified for the low level of realized KUR loans in 2009
Firstly, the Bank Indonesia checking policy required a check on the use of the funds and the worthiness of the debtor business
The policy had lengthened the time needed to disburse the credit
Secondly, debtors who have already liquidated a KUR loan were not permitted to obtain another loan, whereas looking for new borrowers with a new scheme was not easy
Thirdly, according to bank observers, the linkage program mechanism added a stage to the loan disbursement
This caused a rise in interest costs, so the interest rate offered was more than 16%
In Kabupaten Muba and Kabupaten Banjar, community awareness of the KUR program is very limited
At the kecamatan level, the existence of the KUR program is only known by a few staff at the kecamatan and village office
In general, they know of the existence of the KUR program from television, so their level of understanding of the program, including the loan mechanism, is very limited
Touching on the problem of the involvement of relevant agencies in implementing the KUR program, one staff member at the Agency for Cooperatives, UMKM, and Market Management in Kabupaten Muba explained that their agency was only involved in the socialization of the program at the kabupaten level
The socialization of the program was carried out by one implementing bank to several associated agencies
After that, his agency never participated or was not invited to speak about the KUR program, so they do not have information about the running of the KUR program in their area
Almost all household respondents, with the exception of several respondents in Muba, have never heard and are not aware of the existence of the KUR program
It appears that limited socialization means that many village communities do not know of the existence of the KUR program
For that reason, community members who know of, have applied for, or have been able to access the KUR program are very limited in number
These community members were only found in one study village in Kabupaten Muba which is located near the kecamatan capital and where the village head had a business activity
According to one village official, the KUR loan scheme is no different to commercial loans and results in a low level of community access
The low level of community access to the KUR program shows that it does not have an important role in the effort to reduce the impact of the crisis
The poor role is also worsened by the program target that only covers the community that already has a business, which is generally not the worst-affected group
This condition also means that the KUR program also has a limited role in empowering micro and small-scale businesses
Several respondents who have applied for and received KUR loans have different experiences
The type of business activity and the security of loan repayments affect the assessment of the business' worthiness and determine the granting of a loan
One rubber farming respondent explained that he had applied for a KUR loan with the local BRI in 2008 because he was inspired by the other villagers who had obtained KUR loans
All of the requirements such as KTP, family card, photos, business registration papers, and other documents were completed and submitted
To date, however, there has been no response from the relevant bank
One other respondent who successfully accessed KUR explained that the process to obtain a loan was relatively easy
In order to develop a trading business, he applied for a loan of Rp5 million from the local BRI bank
After the loan requirements were fulfilled, BRI agreed and released the loan funds in accordance with the application
An amount of Rp4.5 million from this loan could be used, while the remainder of Rp500,000 was collateral to be saved and could not be taken in accordance with the regulations stipulated in the KUR scheme
According to this respondent, the process from lodging the application until the disbursement took ten days
4.2.7 Village-owned Enterprises (BUMDes) 
In 2007, the Government of Kabupaten Banjar established BUMDes Barakat Bersama or BUMDes for short
BUMDes is a business activity based at the kecamatan level with the objective of advancing and getting the wheels of the rural economy moving in accordance with local economic potential
Initially, BUMDes were only established in four kecamatan
In 2008, the number grew to 13 BUMDes and in 2009 to 17
BUMDes is managed by a staff of the kecamatan office who is appointed as the director and the camat fills the role of commissioner or supervisory board
Seed funding for the BUMDes of Rp10 million per village was provided by the kabupaten government and this became the shareholding of each village
In 2008, the regional budget for BUMDes, including operating costs, reached Rp2.8 billion
According to the BUMDes manager at the kabupaten level, the BUMDes generally operates dynamically
Several BUMDes have been quite successful at developing their business activities
In the business of trading in agricultural products, for example, several BUMDes can compete strongly with business brokers
In fact, they are able to offer a high buying price, so it is more profitable for farmers
Several BUMDes have also successfully passed the evaluation and selection process undertaken by the regional government to trigger the development of BUMDes
These BUMDes will become the best practice BUMDes to be replicated in other places
It is also acknowledged that the success of BUMDes has attracted the interest of several local governments from other regions to undertake comparative studies and develop similar programs
Nevertheless, the managers of the BUMDes in two study kecamatan admit that the running of the BUMDes in their areas is still experiencing a number of obstacles
The causes include the poor performance of managers, low interest of the community in borrowing, and low community awareness of repaying loans
The BUMDes in one study kecamatan that was established in 2008 conducts a savings and loan business with seed funding of Rp260 million
These funds have been loaned to the community at 2% interest per month, with a loan period of around six months, and the size of the loan depends on the capacity of the borrower as well as the value of collateral provided
After one year of operation, only around 30% of loans have been repaid and, at the present time, the newly appointed manager is actively collecting loan repayments
Since July 2009, this BUMDes has also been running a cattle fattening business that is carried out by the community and now has 15 head of cattle
BUMDes in other study kecamatan are also operating savings and loan businesses, but are not running effectively because there are few interested parties
However, other businesses in the form of trading in agricultural products can operate, although they are less developed
4.2.8 Other Programs/Assistance 
In addition to the various social protection programs mentioned above, the governments of Kabupaten Muba and Kabupaten Banjar also provide several other programs with the objectives of assisting in developing services and simultaneously reducing the economic burden on the community
The Government of Kabupaten Muba provides death benefits and free services for the production of SIM, KTP, birth certificates, and the administration costs of first marriages; while the Government of Kabupaten Banjar provides a death benefit and a free KTP service
Respondents, both government officials and the community, consider these programs to be very helpful for the community, especially for the poor
In Kabupaten Muba, a family that has suffered a death will receive a benefit of Rp2.5 million for the death of an adult or Rp1.5 million if a child passes away, while Kabupaten Banjar provides a benefit of Rp500,000 per death
These benefits can be obtained by submitting a request and identification papers from the local village head to the kabupaten government through the kecamatan office
These various regional government programs are not intended to reduce the impact of the crisis because these programs have existed long before the crisis occurred
In Kabupaten Banjar, coal mining companies provide a variety of assistance for communities located near mines in the context of their corporate social responsibility (CSR)
Assistance is provided in the form of benefits for orphans, incentives for teachers paid by honorarium, and contributions for mosques, madrasa/schools, village and school games, and other activities
These companies also provide assistance to repair roads and markets as well as provide clean water supplies
In addition, these companies also provide compensation in the form of village fees or “dust money”, the size of which is in accordance with the volume of production, to households and village officials
One study village that has become a mining location received a fee ranging between Rp50 million to more than Rp150 million per month
These fees are received by the village head and then shared amongst institutions at the village level and the community with the percentage share determined by village decision
According to a confession by the village community, each household receives an amount that ranges from Rp100,000 to Rp400,000 per month from these fees
In other villages that have become stockpiling points for coal before it is transported to the port, the mining company usually provides “dust money” for the community that lives within a certain radius
The amount of the “dust money” and the number of households that receive it is more limited
In Kabupaten Banjar, there is another form of assistance that is sourced from donor institutions in order to empower the community's economy through savings and loan assistance
This program is a project of the Social Affairs Agency of Kabupaten Banjar that is funded by CERD
Villages that receive this program form an LSPBM
Each village receives seed funding of Rp23 million that will be loaned to the community in maximum amounts of Rp1 million and interest of Rp30,000 per year
The implementation of this savings and loan activity faces obstacles in the form of poorly performing loans—around 20%
Nevertheless, managers consider the volume of poorly performing loans to still be within reasonable limits and at the moment, they are making efforts to ensure that customers repay their loans as quickly as possible
V
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 5.1 Conclusions The community is still feeling the negative impact of the GFC although the intensity is declining
However, many government officials have an inadequate awareness and in-depth understanding of what is really happening in the community's life
This situation is especially the result of a lack of an information system on the community's socioeconomic condition that is tiered, periodic, and systematic
The availability of this information system could become the prime mover for the emergence of a sense of crisis and later give birth to a policy that reduces its impact
As a consequence, there are no government officials at any level or in any sector who have clearly responded to the impact on communities that have been most affected by the GFC
There has been no initiative from the central government to provide specially planned social protection programs to reduce the negative impact of the GFC
The failure to make this effort is also closely related to the brief nature of the GFC impact in disrupting the life of the community
The most severe impact of the crisis only lasted for around three months
Not only have there been no special PPS initiatives to reduce the impact of the crisis, but there has been no attempt or plan from government officials to adjust existing PPS to respond to the GFC
The failure to take these initiatives is due to
(i) PPS are planned as poverty reduction programs with specific targets, especially the poor, whereas anyone could be affected by the GFC; (ii) not all PPS provide the space for implementing officials to adapt them because their schedule and program targets have been predetermined; and (iii) PPS officials have the attitude that alleviating the impact of the crisis is not their responsibility
Government officials are only running existing social protection programs with a standard mechanism according to regulation
Fortunately, there are types of PPS with general targets (in the health and education sectors) that unintentionally assist in reducing the expenditure burden on the communities hit by the impact of the crisis, especially those hard hit
However, there are communities that “cannot” access them because of transport costs and administrative requirements
There are also some communities that “do not want” to utilize them because they consider that the free medical treatment service is not good or the medications are ineffective, or because they are embarrassed to accept free treatment
Actually, in the distribution of Raskin rice and the management of PNPM, many village officials have been adapting these activities although they have sometimes breached regulations, for example, in the determination of Raskin targets, increasing the selling price of rice to cover the distribution costs, reducing the allocation of rice per household so more households receive an allocation, changing the PNPM project labor plans, priorities for determining SPP recipients, and so forth
Such practices should be used to respond to the impact of the GFC and be decided through official policy by local government
However, implementing officials do not use these practices to assist affected communities
Other problems faced by various social protection programs are a lack of integration (separated across ministries/management agencies) and each respective program tending to operate independently
The launch of PNPM is considered to be the initial point of awareness and, at the same time, the answer to these problems
In fact, PNPM clearly states that its aim is to reduce poverty and broaden employment opportunities through the consolidation of existing social protection programs in various ministries/institutions
This role is only possible if PNPM management is placed under one institution that has policy authority over ministries/agencies that have, until now, been known to suffer from “sectoral ego sickness”
In addition, at the implementation level, PNPM needs to provide space for local adjustment that is tightly regulated and supervised, including when managers need to adjust program activities to face disasters that have mass and local impacts
5.2 Policy Recommendations Social protection programs are part of the state's responsibilities to maintain and/or improve community welfare
Implementation aspects of social protection programs that have been ongoing still need to be improved and/or adapted to actual conditions that evolve in the community
a) Social and economic shocks can occur anytime and the impact can affect any group in the community
For that reason, it is time for the government to plan and develop a crisis information system that is fast, timely, and accurate
The search for information can be undertaken through news reports monitoring, the utilization of communication technologies such as quick counts, and field surveys
This information system has to involve various relevant stakeholders from the government and the private sector, both at the center and in the regions
b) All forms of social protection programs that are now operating were only designed for normal socioeconomic conditions
In order to assist community groups that have been affected by socioeconomic shocks such as the GFC, especially the poor or those who have fallen into poverty, the following steps need to be undertaken
(1) For reasons of effectiveness, efficiency, and a more responsive emergency performance, the central government needs to provide a legal framework in the form of implementation guidelines that provide the space or flexibility for legally modifying the existing social protection programs to respond to, or recover from, the impact of socioeconomic shocks in the community
(2) When socioeconomic shocks occur, the central and regional governments need to adapt the implementation mechanism of the following social protection programs
(a) PNPM
Simplify the stages in the activity process and the disbursement of funds
If necessary, when socioeconomic shocks occur and the funding disbursement is not completed, bailout funds can be used
(b) Raskin
Provide authority to implementing officials at the village level to adapt the targets, the amount of rice allocated to each target, and the rice quota across regions in accordance with the nature of the shock and the groups affected
If necessary, distribute rice at no cost to the affected groups
(c) BOS
Encourage regional participation to raise APBD contributions to the education sector, so free education services are available to the affected communities
(d) Jamkesmas
Encourage regional participation to raise APBD contributions to the health sector, so free health services are available to the affected communities
(e) BLT
Implement ad hoc BLT programs in affected regions
(f) PKH
Direct development in PKH pilot regions to affected areas
(g) KUR
Increase the intensity and effectiveness of socialization and simplify the loan requirements and procedures
(3) The government needs to create special programs to respond to the impact of crises, for example, labor-intensive programs (cash for work)
c) To guarantee the achievement of various government initiatives to raise the people's welfare and sharpen an understanding of social protection programs overall, the concept of social protection programs needs to be viewed and understood within the following four groups of objectives
(1) universal programs that are undertaken in connection with the government's responsibility to develop Indonesia as a welfare state, through the provision of free health programs (the development of Jamkesmas) and free schooling programs (the development of BOS); 
(2) poverty reduction programs that are implemented sustainably in the effort to reduce the number of poor households (PKH, PNPM, and KUR); 
(3) recovery programs from the impact of crises and disasters that are specially provided for communities affected by local and mass socioeconomic shocks to ensure the availability of reasonable basic needs and recovery/provision of community businesses (Raskin, BLT, and labor-intensive projects); and 
(4) social assistance programs that are specially provided for poor citizens who are not yet or not productive, such as assistance for orphans, people with disabilities, and the aged
d) Until now, the management of social protection programs has been dispersed across several institutions
In the field, the synergy between programs is weak because of a lack of coordination among other reasons
For that reason, the implementation of all social protection programs should be integrated and placed under the control of one central institution that has a strong mandate
In addition, the implementation of these programs needs to consider the politics of decentralization and regional participation, with clear sharing of government administrative functions (see Figure 5)
e) Given that the ability to fund social protection programs is still limited and also for reasons of social justice, universal social protection programs need to obligate well-off communities to contribute to their funding
WHAT ARE THE LABOUR IMPACTS OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS
I
Background The impact of the global financial crisis (GFC) in Indonesia started to be felt when the economic growth slowed sharply at the end of 2008
Even though the economy still showed some resilience towards the GFC compared to the neighboring countries, marked by 4.4% GDP growth in the first quarter of 2009, we observed a rapid contraction in trade, large declines in export, and major falls in prices of important commodities
The largest fall in sectoral growth was in the manufacturing industries (of textile-leather-footwear, wood, and wood products) and in the trade, hotel, and restaurant (retail and wholesale trade) industries
The growth of these sectors declined to its lowest point in the middle of the 3rd quarter of 2009
In order to obtain a micro-level picture on how the crisis transmitted and how it had impacted the manufacturing sector at the community and household levels, SMERU conducted a qualitative assessment in one urban community close to a major industrial park in Kabupaten Bekasi
As for the macro-level picture of the crisis impact, it was obtained through a quantitative assessment using a nationally representative labor force survey (Sakernas) before and after the onset of the GFC, conducted by research partners from the Institute of Development Studies (IDS), University of Sussex, United Kingdom (UK)
This policy brief specifically draws on both assessments to offer key messages with policy relevance especially on the impact of GFC on the labor market
II
Key Findings The data used for the quantitative assessment is taken from the three waves of Sakernas
February 2008, August 2008, and February 2009
The period between the first two waves marks the run up to the GFC in the midst of the global food crisis
The GFC itself hit Indonesia between the second and third waves of the survey
The Sakernas questionnaire is designed to collect data on the workforce for individuals aged 10 and over
However, households are only sampled if they live in a physical building and are either a family living together, an individual renting a room independently, or a group of lodgers with less than 10 people
From the data, we found that Indonesia weathered the storm rather well
There is little evidence for changes in school dropouts or attendance, except for younger students where dropout rates fell and attendance improved
Similarly, labor force participation is unchanged for the most part
Unemployment rose for the young, but fell for workers over 25
The changes for female workers were the same as those for male workers and there did not appear to have been any major sectoral shifts in labor
The most surprising finding is the significant and large increases in real wages for employees over the period of the financial crisis, although those outside the formal sector do not share this improvement (McCullogh and Amit Grover, 2010)
The repeated visits1 to the sample community in Kabupaten Bekasi for the qualitative assessment offer more or less similar results to those of the quantitative analysis especially related to the little effect on schooling and participation in the labor force, particularly permanent employees
However, the qualitative study provides more in-depth evidence; much of it is about the impact of the crisis on outsourced (subcontract) workers
Using the qualitative-participatory approach by conducting a series of discussions with people who worked (or had worked) in the industrial park, as well as for firms and labor outsourcing companies, we gain a better understanding of how outsourcing has worked in practice and its impact upon firms and workers especially during the crisis
the case of Bekasi Due to the GFC, in early 2009, production in most electronics and automotive industries in the Bekasi industrial park had substantially slowed down
This is particularly affecting outsourced workers in the industries, mostly young migrant workers who experienced immediate contract terminations (even before their contract legally ended), nonrenewal of contracts, and reduction in working hours and overtime
Some workers have left the area, but others stayed on, hoping for an early recovery in the situation
In August 2009, things were gradually improving, as some industries had recalled old workers and recruited new workers
Some new industries had even started production, providing employment opportunities to as many as 6,000 new workers, mostly young women
The recovery continued toward the end of 2009 and early 2010
There were more labor placements and less layoffs as well as their frequency, and some companies started to have normal working hours and overtime
Nevertheless, the problem faced by subcontract workers remains the same
In some cases, they are now facing more precarious job conditions, with less bargaining power to have a better working condition
Aside from GFC as a pretext, much of the problems are related to Labor Law No
13/2003 and the prolonged concern over its implementation
Outsourcing laws have given firms the flexibility to downsize rapidly when faced with the crisis
Our interviews confirmed the importance, from the perspective of the firms, of having the flexibility to reduce the size of their labor force
Most large firms employ substantial numbers of contract workers, either directly or indirectly through labor outsourcing organizations (LPTK)
For example, one Japanese firm in the automotive sector had 850 employees at the end of 2008, but over 200 of them were contract workers
All of these contract workers had been let go during the crisis
A large electronics firm has moved from a ratio of 70% permanent and 30% outsourced to 50:50
Thus, the existence of outsourced workers has enabled firms to substantially reduce production cost when faced with a dramatic reduction in demand from abroad
Almost all firms have reduced or eliminated overtime and reduced the number of shifts worked
Others have cut back on benefits (e.g., transport, food, healthcare) that previously were given to workers
These reductions have had a substantial impact on workers
For example, in one firm in the automotive sector, the basic pay for a new entry worker is Rp1–1.5 million per month, but with overtime, monthly take home pay before the crisis was typically Rp4–4.5 million
Thus, the elimination of overtime represents a large reduction in take home pay
Firms routinely rotate workers to avoid making them permanent
To avoid workers becoming permanent, firms employ them through outsourcing companies
This allows firms to employ these workers for “noncore” tasks for up to 2 years
They then often shift workers from being employed by the outsourcing company to being employed as contract workers directly by the firm
Firms can legally employ them as contract workers for a further two years
After this, most contract employees are let go to avoid making them permanent
In many cases, they go back to work for the outsourcing company
However, to avoid the suggestion that they are breaking the law, workers are sometimes put in a different firm for a certain period of time before returning to the original one; alternatively, their name can be modified so that the same name does not appear in the records more than once
In this way, workers oscillate between contract and outsourcing employment for a few years without ever becoming permanent workers.
Outsourced workers do not only do “noncore” activities
Many of the firms in the industrial park employ hundreds of employees performing relatively simple assembly line tasks
These are clearly core activities, in that they pertain to the production of the main product of the firm
However, the definition of “core activities” in the law is unclear, so some firms and outsourcing companies appear to define “noncore” as meaning only making a small part of the final product
Since this is true for almost every task in an assembly line, all operator or production line jobs become eligible for outsourcing
Firms deliberately disempowered workers to ensure a compliant workforce
Most openly, all production line workers must be between 18 and 24 years old
Our interviews with firms and outsourcing companies confirmed that this was done to ensure that the workers have no experience of working conditions elsewhere and, as relatively new employees, are disinclined to complain
Moreover, firms prefer employing migrant workers from outside the region— mostly from Central Java—to locals
Firms perceive these workers to be more hardworking and less inclined to give up or be absent
Their lack of roots in the local community also makes them less likely to be involved in demonstrations or complaints
Migrant workers are alienated from the local communities in which they live
They rarely participate in community events and never receive any benefit from social protection programs
However, in the village surveyed, relations between the local community and the migrant workers seem reasonably amicable
One reason for these good relations may be the support that is given to them by local village officials
In part, this is because local officials recognize the benefit in terms of local demand for the presence of a large number of migrants in the village
However, some officials also benefit financially from their presence since they own a large number of the rudimentary blocks of accommodation which house the migrants
Some outsourcing companies charge fees for employment
Although many outsourcing companies appear to provide a useful recruitment and training service, some require candidates to pay significant nonrefundable deposits to obtain a job
For example, one female worker interviewed had to pay Rp1.5 million to get a 3-month contract with a wage of Rp1.2 million per month
We also heard of cases in which local officials will take money from workers to secure jobs and cases where local thugs will take money from workers and then threaten outsourcing companies to find them jobs
Outsourced and contract workers have no union to represent them and a very little bargaining power
Unions represent permanent workers and look after their interests
Indeed, the conditions of permanent workers are so much better than those of contract and outsourced workers
It would be against their interests to take up their cause since this might result in a reduction in benefits for permanent workers
There are no bodies looking after the interests of contract and outsourced workers or negotiating on their behalf
The contract workers we spoke to feared that they would be instantly dismissed if they were to form or join such an association 
III
Key Messages and Policy Recommendations The existence of outsourcing has given firms the flexibility they needed to downsize when faced with a sharp reduction in demand and to increase employment again when demand recovers as is now beginning to happen
However, the constant rotation of workers in and out of outsourced and contract jobs serves no useful purpose and only arises because of labor policy
It also has an economic cost since firms sometimes let workers who have gained valuable skills and experience go just to avoid the cost of making them permanent
At the same time, firms use the ability to constantly change workers, as well as their selection only of young workers and migrants, as a way of ensuring no demand for better conditions
This is clearly unfair and discriminatory
Two changes to labor policy could both provide firms with the flexibility that they need and also improve protection for the majority of workers
1
Abolish the distinction between permanent and nonpermanent employment
The rotation of employment between outsourced and contract work only happens because firms wish to avoid the high benefits, inflexibility, and high severance costs associated with permanent employment
However, workers vary greatly, both in the wages and benefits that they are willing to accept and in their ability to bear insecurity
For example, younger workers may be much more willing to accept temporary or insecure work than older workers with families to support
It therefore makes much more sense to allow firms to tailor contracts to demand
If the distinction between permanent and nonpermanent was abolished, then firms could offer a range of contracts of different lengths and with different benefit packages based upon their needs for different skills and experience
At the same time, all contracts, both short and longer term, could provide severance pay, which is proportionate to length of service and is accumulated through compulsory monthly contributions from employer and employee, just as other basic social security is currently provided
2
Introduce compulsory plant level representation for all workers
A key concern with abolishing the distinction between permanent and nonpermanent employment would be that firms would reduce all contracts to short-term positions with poor benefits
The need to keep skilled workers in a competitive labor market makes this unlikely for the top end of the wage distribution
But it is perfectly possible that firms could continue to exploit the weak bargaining power of those at the bottom of the wage distribution
Compulsory representation could alleviate this by providing a legally mandated coordination mechanism for all workers to press for improvements in pay and conditions consistent with the performance of the plant
These changes would require a major change in mindset for both firms and workers
However, they could also help to end discriminatory treatment of workers and improve the pay and conditions for the majority of workers, whilst still giving firms the flexibility they need to deal with changing demand
In addition to that, it is also necessary to ensure that effective monitoring system and law enforcement are in place, especially related to the existing practice of labor outsourcing company, giving sanctions to any violations
This could be done through revitalizing government's roles in monitoring the process of labor outsourcing
It is also important to ensure that that contract workers are participating in the Employee Social Security (Jamsostek) program and only have one number of membership (though they have worked in different companies)
This will be a safety net for workers when subject to working termination especially in time of crisis

ABSTRACT 
The Specific Allocation Fund (DAK) Mechanism and Uses This study aims to analyze the management of the Specific Allocation Fund (DAK)
The three largest DAK-recipient sectors are the focus of the study
education, health, and roads infrastructure
The study sample areas are four districts
This paper was compiled based on the results of in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with various stakeholders as well as analysis of DAK policy and secondary data
The main objective of DAK is to reduce interregional inequalities in public services
We came across policies in dire need of national uniformity but that still allow variation on some aspects
Conversely, we found some enforced national uniformity in policies that should have provided rooms for variations to accommodate regional specific conditions
In practice, regional governments have become passive recipients of DAK grants
The attitudes of regional government towards the DAK allocation process indicate a general feeling that the central government is not transparent
Furthermore, it is evident that coordination and communication surrounding DAK management between agencies are still limited
Based on the above findings, we recommend a new paradigm where the central government is suggested to decentralize the authority for the allocation, coordination, and monitoring of district/city use of DAK to provincial governments

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This study, which was conducted from April 2007 to January 2008, aims to analyze the management mechanisms of the Specific Allocation Fund (DAK) from its regulation and allocation processes down to responsibility for its use
The three largest DAK-recipient sectors are the focus of the study
education, health, and road infrastructure
Three districts (kabupaten) and one city (kota) were purposively selected as the study sample regions
Kabupaten Kupang, Kabupaten Wonogiri, Kabupaten Gorontalo, and Kota Banda Aceh
This report was compiled based on the results of in-depth interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) with various stakeholders as well as research on DAK policy and an analysis of secondary data
Generally, DAK is similar to the Presidential Instruction (Inpres) Fund, which were developed under the New Order administration
DAK is allocated in the national budget (APBN) to fund various specific development activities implemented in and by the regions
It aims to reduce interregional inequalities in public services and increase regional government responsibility for the mobilization of their resources
Although DAK is a part of the regional budget (APBD), regional governments must abide by various central regulations governing its use, such as laws, government regulations, presidential decrees, ministerial regulations and decrees, and circulars from director-generals in each ministry that receives a DAK allocation
Under the weight of so many central regulations, very few regional governments have made their own regulations to detail policies covering DAK management
The research into legislative regulation found that as yet there are no government regulations that specifically regulate DAK as is mandated by the law
To date, no government regulation has been issued regarding the staged transfer of deconcentration and co-administration (tugas pembantuan) funds to DAK
In addition, various centralistic regulations regarding the organization as well as tasks and functions of ministries and nonministerial institutions have not been adjusted to conform with the decentralization and regional autonomy legislation
Consequently, DAK management policies differ between departments and regions
SMERU also came across policies in dire need of national uniformity but that still allow variation on some aspects
Conversely, SMERU found some enforced national uniformity in policies that should have provided room for variation to accommodate regional, local, or other specific conditions
Many parties in the regions consider that the central government is often late releasing regulations concerning DAK, clashing with regional planning timetables
When the content of late-issued central decisions differs from the estimations a region has used when preparing their APBD, the APBD must be revised and later reassessed by the regional house of representatives (DPRD)
Apart from wasting the time of government apparatus, this process wastes a significant amount of funds, stretching the regions' already limited fiscal capacity
In practice, regional governments have become passive recipients of DAK grants, notwithstanding the legislation that actually enables the regions to actively submit proposals
Thus far, regional governments are only tasked to send data concerning regional conditions of facilities and infrastructure in the sectors that receive DAK allocations
The central government (specifically the Ministry of Finance) then uses that data as a determinant for the allocation of DAK by sector and region
Aside from that, the determination of the sectors that are to receive a DAK allocation follows the development priorities laid out in the government work plan (RKP)
In 2007, DAK was allocated to seven administrative service sectors
education, health, infrastructure, regional governance infrastructure, maritime affairs and fisheries, agriculture, and the environment
General, specific, and technical criteria are used to determine DAK allocation
After a region's DAK value has been calculated, the regional government distributes the allocations to various projects and activities in accordance with central government policy
Until 2005, the proportion of DAK allocation to the total APBN expenditure was still below 1%
In 2006, the proportion increased almost two-fold to 1.7%, or Rp11.6 trillion, while the General Allocation Fund (DAU) accounted for almost 22% of the total APBN expenditure
In the same year, deconcentration and co-administration funds totaled more than Rp30 trillion, or 4.4% of the total APBN expenditure
If a portion of deconcentration and co-administration funds is transferred to DAK, over the next few years, the proportion of DAK to the total APBN expenditure could reach 5%
Since 2003, the three administrative services sectors that have received the largest proportion of DAK have been education, health, and infrastructure, specifically road infrastructure
The attitudes of regional governments towards the DAK allocation process indicate a general feeling that the central government is not transparent, to the point where regions need to “lobby Jakarta” in order to receive larger allocations
News of the existence of “calo anggaran”, or budget brokers, in recent times has strengthened the indications of opaque DAK allocation practices
The bupati (district heads) and heads of DAK-receiving regional offices conduct lobbying efforts, and in fact one regional government handed the assignment over to a private company
Analysis results of the accuracy of DAK allocations for regions show that the correlation signs of DAK allocation by province on the condition of public service infrastructure in the basic education and road infrastructure are in line with the DAK objectives; however, the correlation values are low
In the health sector, the correlation sign is even contrary to the DAK objectives
This indicates that in allocating DAK to regions, the central government has given some consideration to factors that are not directly related with the infrastructure conditions of the sectors in question
It is evident that coordination and communication surrounding DAK management between agencies at the central level and the regional level, including both provincial and district/city levels, are still limited
Thus far, very few regional governments have fulfilled their obligations to report their use of DAK quarterly
There are four possible causes for this
(i) while the regulations provide sanctions for not reporting, the central government has not applied the sanctions; 
(ii) several regional governments that have submitted reports have not received any response from the central government, and consequently, the regional governments are no longer concerned about their reporting obligations; 
(iii) the sanctions for failing to report would be applied to the region, not the negligent official, and correspondingly, officials do not feel obliged to compile the report; and/or 
(iv) regional governments do not have the sufficient capacity to manage public finances
Based on the above findings, SMERU recommend the following recommendations to improve the policies and implementation of the use of DAK
(1) Various regulations must be reformed in order to support the proper implementation of decentralization and regional autonomy in general and DAK management specifically
This would optimalize efforts to balance the quality and quantity of public services throughout Indonesia
(2) A number of new paradigms are required for the management of DAK
These would decentralize the authority for the allocation, coordination, and monitoring of district/city use of DAK to provincial governments
This authority requires safeguarding regulations to guarantee the implementation of transparency and participation mechanisms, accountability procedures, and a reward and punishment system
Such a policy would have three benefits
(i) the simplification of DAK management at the central level, (ii) the strengthening of governors' authority as representatives of the central government in the regions, and (iii) the empowerment of provinces as autonomous regions through fiscal discretion
(3) Sanctions should be devised for bureaucrats, not regions or the populace as a whole, for bureaucratic failures in the management of DAK in particular and of regional fiscal matters in general
I
INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
Entering the era of decentralization, otherwise known as “big-bang decentralization” from 2001, the central government has played an important role in supporting the implementation of administrative affairs which have been decentralized to regional government (pemda)
Particularly in matters of finance, the central government has the responsibility to maintain balance in interregional funds allocation
In order to succeed in this task, the central government transfers funds to the regions via several mechanisms, such as General Allocation Fund (DAU), Specific Allocation Fund (DAK), and Shared Revenue Fund (DBH)
These three balance funds have differing aims and natures
They are all channeled into the regional budget (APBD)
Hence, regional governments must justify their management of the funds to the Regional House of Representatives (DPRD)
Besides that, the central government also provides loans and assistance to regional governments
The aim of the funds transfer, just like the purpose of the central government's fiscal policy in the framework of the implementation of regional autonomy, includes to reduce financial discrepancies between the center and the regions as well as between regions and to reduce interregional discrepancies in public services provision
To date, balanced funds are still the largest source of regional revenue
In 2006, total transfers to the regions nominally increased by 47% compared to the previous year
DAU is a block grant; hence, regional governments are free to make use of the funds without interference from the central government
Funds for the DBH are sourced from APBN income which is reallocated to the (producer) regions in shares as regulated by Law (UU) No
33/2004
DBH is distributed as taxation DBH (DBH Pajak) and natural resources DBH (DBH Sumber Daya Alam)
Taxation DBH consists of land and building tax (PBB), land and building transfer fees (BPHTB), and personal income tax (PPh)
Natural resources DBH is comprised of forestry, mining, fisheries, oil, natural gas, and geothermal revenues
In contrast to DAU and DBH, the acquisition and use of DAK must follow the guidelines determined by the central government
DAK is allocated to specific regions in the national budget to fund specific activities that are of regional affairs and reflect national priorities
Regions can receive DAK on fulfillment of three criteria
(1) general criteria based on the Net Fiscal Index (NFI); (2) specific criteria based on legislative regulation and regional characteristics; and (3) technical criteria based on technical indexes in the relevant industry (Law No
32/2004 and Law No 33/2004)
Approximately 80% of regionally managed DAU is used for routine expenditure, mainly the wages of regional government public servants
Because of this, DAK is the main regional source for infrastructure construction
If well managed, DAK, which is specifically used for building and revitalizing physical infrastructure, can improve the quality of education, increase health services, and at the very least reduce infrastructural damage
These efforts are of paramount importance for overcoming poverty and building a more competitive national economy
DAK recipient regions are obliged to provide co-funding (dana pendamping) from the APBD amounting to a minimum of 10% of the total DAK they receive
Exceptions can be granted to regions with low fiscal capacity
Regions are also obliged to provide 3% of the total value of the received DAK for general costs taken from other sources of income
DAK is used to close interregional gaps in public services provision, with priority given to education, health, infrastructure, maritime affairs and fisheries, agriculture, regional administrative infrastructure, and the environment
In 2006 the central government allocated as much as Rp11.6 trillion to DAK and in 2007 the figure rose sharply to Rp17.094 trillion
Starting from 2007, deconcentration funds and co-administration (tugas pembantuan) funds used in the regions will be disbursed to regions via the DAK mechanism in stages
Deconcentration funds will be allocated to provinces while co-administration funds may be allocated to provinces, districts (kabupaten), or cities (kota) as representatives of the central government in the regions
In contrast to DAU, DBH, deconcentration funds, and co-administration funds, DAK is specifically given to districts or cities
To date, the focus of study has often been efforts to optimize revenue sources, while studies on the optimization of expenditure focuses are rarely conducted
Studies of the implementation and impact of DAK, for example, are rare
Linked to this, questions that frequently emerge are concerning simple things like how the distribution mechanisms and management of DAK are proceeding
Although there are several criteria for the allocation of DAK, the accountability processes at the national and regional levels have not yet been widely publicized
1.2 Aim and Scope This research, which was conducted from April 2007 to January 2008, aims to study various policies related to the management of DAK and their implementation in the field 
(1) studying the mechanisms and formulation/criteria of DAK at the central government level in relation to 
(a) regulations connected with DAK which have become guidelines for implementers (planning, allocation determination procedures, fund disbursement mechanisms, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and coordination between agencies); 
(b) the allocation of other funds which have the same or similar aims to DAK; 
(c) the role of various agencies (the National Development Planning Board (Bappenas), Ministry of Finance (Depkeu), Ministry of Home Affairs (Depdagri), the Technical Ministry of the Ministry of National Education (Depdiknas), Ministry of Health (Depkes), Ministry of Public Works (Deppu) in the management of DAK (involving bottom-up planning versus top-down planning, allocation determination, disbursement and use of funds, and responsibilities); 
(d) how much and to where funds are allocated (sectoral, regional, type of project, project implementation methods, and conformity to legislative regulations); and 
(e) problems and suggestions for moving forward; 
(2) studying the regional government's capacity in the use of DAK in relation to (a) methods and efforts to obtain funds; 
(b) regional regulations and policies involving the administration of DAK; 
(c) the regional government's experiences in making use of other funds having aims that are the same as or similar to those of DAK;
(d) the role of various regional agencies (Regional Development Planning Board (Bappeda), Provincial House of Representatives (DPRD), Finance Division, Technical Agency, and regional offices of the Directorate-General for Treasury (Kanwil DJP) in the management of DAK (involving planning, use, monitoring, responsibilities, and conformity to regulations and policies); 
(e) the disbursement procedures and processes (from the APBN to APBD, cofunding, distribution to projects, and conformity to regulations and policies);
(f) the amount of funds received for what project (basis for the choice, allocation, and location for each project, project management
contractor versus self-managed, and conformity to regulations and policies); 
(g) project quality; and 
(h) obstacles and suggestions for moving forward
Methodology 
This study qualitatively analyzed the current DAK funding, various problems that have emerged in its distribution, and regulation of the use of DAK both at the central and regional levels
It is focused on the three sectors that receive the greatest amount of DAK funding
education, health, and road infrastructure
Information regarding stakeholder perceptions was gathered at both the central and regional levels, concentrating on efforts to increase the management accountability of DAK
A qualitative approach was also used to uncover DAK's regulatory and implementational framework, information transparency, receipt and use of funds, and various obstacles and their possible solutions
The study also used a quantitative approach to see the proportion of DAK in both the APBN and APBD, the proportion of DAK compared to other balance funds, and DAK trends in the APBN and APBD, particularly in the span of the last five years
A quantitative analysis was also done to correlate DAK allocation with the condition of public service infrastructure in each province
The research sample areas covered one district or city in each of four provinces
Sample areas were selected based on criteria such as 
(1) representativeness of all regions in Indonesia
Sumatra, Java–Bali, Kalimantan– Sulawesi, and Nusa Tenggara–Maluku–Papua; 
(2) the sample provinces being DAK recipients and being the provinces that receive the largest DAK allocations among the provinces in their respective areas; 
(3) variations in the regional economic growth figures and gross regional domestic product (GRDP); 
(4) covering districts and cities, that is, three districts and one city; and 
(5) sample districts/city being DAK recipients for all priority sectors and being the districts/city receiving the largest DAK allocations among all the districts/cities in their respective provinces
Data and information were collected in a document review covering all legislative regulations issued by the central government and regional governments at the provincial and district/city levels
National and regional budgets since the beginning of the decentralization period were also compiled
In-depth interviews were conducted with national-level officials from the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Bappenas, and the House of Representatives (DPR), as well as several officials from technical ministries in DAK priority sectors, specifically the Ministry of National Education, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Public Works
In-depth interviews were also conducted with provincial and district/city officials, as well as with stakeholders in the use of development projects funded by DAK
Regional stakeholders interviewed include officials from Bappeda, education offices, health offices, public works offices, finance and economy divisions of regional secretariates, regional offices of the Directorate-General for Treasury under the Ministry of Finance, DPRD representatives, principals of DAK-recipient schools, contractors (Indonesian Association of Construction Contractors/Gapensi), boards of education, nongovernment organizations, community health centre (puskesmas) heads, the mass media, and users
Information was also gathered via focus group discussions (FGDs) attended by officials from all regional governments and other connected agencies responsible for policies and the implementation of DAK's use
Report Structure 
Chapter I is an introductory chapter outlining the background, aims and scope of the study, methodology, and report structure
Chapter II will explain the regulations related to DAK, covering from planning to accountability
Chapter III will explain DAK allocations in the APBN and APBD, DAK allocations according to priority sectors, and DAK allocations in the sample areas
Chapter IV looks at transparency, accountability, and participation in the use of DAK, mainly by the regions
Finally, Chapter V will emphasize several important notes about the research, provide a summary, and present several recommendations

REGULATIONS
FROM PLANNING TO ACCOUNTABILITY 
In more than half a century after independence, Indonesia's system of governance has tended to be managed centrally
In this system, everything related to administrative matters was planned and regulated by the central government
Regional governments had the task of implementing everything that was decided and ordered by the central government
An argument that often emerged on the back of the centralistic system was to achieve national unity for the Republic of Indonesia
However, for a country as large as Indonesia with tens of thousands of islands, containing hundreds of ethnicities, and a population of more than 220 million people, a centralized administrative system cannot effectively regulate and implement all administrative matters by itself
The centralistic system will dominate if monitoring mechanisms by the public and accountability to the public are weak and not open
This system is inclined to create an increasingly large and complex bureaucracy
A bureaucracy that continues to grow, at a certain point, will no longer be able to service and settle governance matters
Instead, it will become the source of problems
A nation is built for the sake of the welfare of its people
National unity of the Republic of Indonesia is not the aim, but rather it is a tool to achieve this aim
Because of this, when the monetary crisis occurred and was prolonged by political uncertainty, several community groups demanded democratization in various aspects of national life, including opposing the centralized governance which had been hiding behind the justification of maintaining national unity
These efforts included a push for the decentralization of authority and fiscal matters
The decentralization system gave regions the authority to manage their own household with regional autonomy status
An early result from the push for these changes came with the founding of Law No
22/1999 on Regional Governance and Law No
25/1999 on Fiscal Balance between the Central Government and Regional Administrations which came into effect on 1 January 2001
In 2004, these two laws were revised with Law No
32/2004 and Law No
33/2004 respectively
Based on these two laws, district/city governments are authorized and have the responsibility to provide wide ranging public services in almost all sectors of community life
These legislative regulations have made the framework for fiscal management relationships which were previously dominated by the center through Regional Autonomy Subsidies (SDO) and Presidential Instruction (Inpres) Funds more flexible under DAU and DAK
Generally, DAU replaces SDO for civil servant wages and governance activities, while DAK replaces the Inpres Fund by funding various specific activities in and by the regions
This chapter focuses on highlighting the dynamics of policy regulations (legislative regulations), mainly covering the allocation, distribution, and use of DAK
2.1 Observation of Funds with Similar Purposes (Presidential Instruction Fund)
The New Order government, aside from being known as having a high-growth economic strategy, also had a poverty reduction strategy
In the New Order era, the central government generally transferred funds to regional governments in two types of grants
firstly, general grants, in the form of SDO, which were allocated to fulfill regional needs and were only to be used in accordance with central government directives; and secondly, specific grants, in the form of the Inpres Fund, which were allocated to fulfill specific regional needs and were implemented and monitored by the center
Both of these types of grants were intended to reduce interregional inequality and raise regional government responsibility for the mobilization of regional resources (World Bank 2003)
The specific grants were channeled to regional development in various forms, such as through specific Inpres on primary schools, health, reforestation, villages, left-behind villages, level II regions (districts/cities), and level I regions (provinces)
These various Inpres show that the government used a regional approach as well as a sectoral approach in the allocation of funds
The Inpres program had a key role in providing and widening community access to goods and services for basic human needs
As a result, while at the beginning of the New Order the poverty rate was no less than 60%, after three decades of the government, based on the 1996 national socioeconomic survey (Susenas), the rate had fallen to only around 11% (Suara Pembaruan 1997)
Before the decentralization era, Indonesia submitted to a national financial system that enabled the center to control large and productive income sources without returning anything to the producer region
This system pushed the large-scale, wide-open access to the allocation of funds to ministries and nondepartmental institutions (Simanjuntak 2005), while the regions mostly only managed income sources with a value approaching their collection costs
The high extent of centralized harvesting of these productive income sources became one of the causes for regional governments' inability to fund their budgetary requirements
Governance with a financial system as illustrated has a tendency to rupture, even more so when the center's use of funds is self-controlled and self-administered by each provincial office and district office
Although the allocation of funds that were channeled to the regions in the era prior to decentralization continued to increase, it was evident that the center was still controlling the funds by allocating the majority via the deconcentration mechanisms (as a means to soften the centralized system) rather than decentralization (World Bank 2003)
As a result, these conditions further weakened the authority of regional governments
Consequently, besides being inclined to nurture the practice of corruption, collusion, and nepotism (KKN), a centralized financial system such as this also killed off any spirit of innovation and creation within regional governments and regional communities
This, among other reasons, was the cause of the monetary and political crises at the end of the 1990s that forced the New Order administration to step down
Table 2.1 gives a picture of the regional government income and expenditure before decentralization
Around 85% of the regional income was sourced from central financial transfers to the regions in the form of both subsidies and shared tax revenues
The regional government's expenditure had been split into two groups
routine expenditure and development expenditure
Routine expenditure was used to pay civil servant wages as well as goods and services required to run the administration, while development expenditure was used to fund the development of new activities and projects in efforts toward regional progress
Planning
At the policy level, mechanisms for the management of the Inpres Fund started with development planning from below in accordance with the Minister of Home Affairs Regulation No
9/1982 on Guidelines for Preparing and Managing Development in the Regions (P5D)
Plans for activities and projects to be funded by Inpres funds all fell under the development activities and projects funded by the APBD
The preparation of project plans was preceded by a community consultation meeting (musyawarah) on development at the village level, then further discussed at the subdistrict (kecamatan) level, and then adapted to fit the general planning framework prepared by all the government offices or agencies of autonomous regions
The outcomes from the offices or agencies were outlined in a development coordination meeting (rapat koordinasi pembangunan/rakorbang)
A criticism that often arose from this process was that more and more outcomes of the musyawarah at the lower level were lost when the motions were proposed in the higher-level meeting
Allocation
Based on estimations of central allocation of Inpres funds, regional heads, through Bappeda and in conjunction with the relevant offices or agencies of autonomous regions, would fine-tune the program design in order to adapt the activities and projects requiring funding to the available allocation limit
At this level, it was often the case that several project suggestions that had already been agreed upon were not granted funding or were left off the list of activities and projects for the relevant year, but were instead added to the agenda for the following year's development coordination meeting
Distribution and Flows
Inpres funds were distributed by the center via the publishing of Authorization for Development Assistance Budget (SPABP) which contained the funding allocations for regional governments
Funds were distributed through the National Treasury and Cash Office (KPKN) to regional cash accounts
From these accounts, Inpres funds were distributed to individual development activities and projects via the APBD
2.2 DAK Regulation at the National Level Two legislative regulations on decentralization and regional autonomy, Law No
32/2004 and Law No
33/2004, form the new basis for the application of political structure and governance administration, especially fiscal policy, in Indonesia
However, in practice, these regulations are often disrupted by legislative regulations concerning the tasks and function of ministries and nonministerial institutions that have not yet been brought into line with the new regulations on decentralization
These legislative regulations were formed under the centralistic system with a high level of authority to regulate and make various decisions in all corners of the country
As a result, while a large share of governmental authority has already been decentralized, the structure of ministries and nonministerial institutions has not really changed
On the budgeting side, they still control a relatively large share of the budget, including deconcentration and co-administration (dana pembantuan) funds for matters that have actually already been decentralized
Another obstacle to the implementation of decentralization is the late preparation of follow-on government regulations forming the basis for the creation and enforcement of relevant legislative regulations
In other words, the implementation of specific articles in laws is not supported by regulations that have been agreed to at the national level
An implication of this is that their implementation in the field can differ between ministries and also between regions
The late preparation of government regulations mandated by such legislation also occurred for laws in the previous era
For example, the directive of Law No
5/1974 on Administrative Principles in the Regions to prepare a Government Regulation on the Implementation of Regional Autonomy Emphasizing District Regions was fulfilled 18 years after the law was approved (Usman et al
1996)
Law No
32/2004 regulates that the authority for the coordination of a large share of administrative matters is to be delegated to the regions, while Law No
33/2004 regulates fiscal balancing policy as a consequence of the division of authority between the central government and regional governments
The implementation of administrative matters that now fall under the authority of regional governments are funded from the APBD
Currently, a large number of regions are unable to collect any more than 15% of the total value of the APBD through locally-derived revenues (PAD)
As a result, the central government must cover any shortfalls through balance funds consisting of DBH, DAU, and DAK which complement each other
Moreover, this observation is only focused on regulations that regulate the use of DAK
Article 162 of Law No
32/2004 states that DAK is allocated in the APBN for specific regions in the framework of decentralization funding for (1) funding specific activities determined by the central government based on national priorities and (2) funding specific activities as suggested by the recipient region
A more thorough regulation of DAK is mandated in Article 162 Subsection 4, which states that DAK is to be regulated in a government regulation, but to date the intended regulation does not exist
Consequently, so far in practice DAK has only been allocated for the first purpose, while the second purpose has not been put into practice (Bappenas 2006)
Bappenas gathered suggestions from the regions when DAK was first implemented
The value of the activities and projects proposed by the regions totaled in the hundreds of trillions of rupiah, far above the funds that the APBN can provide
One staff member from the Ministry of Education stated that he often receives letters of suggestion from the regions
However, they cannot all be considered for DAK allocation because the mechanisms are not yet in place
While not fully using the second approach, some regions have proposed to modify the use of DAK that has already been allocated for specific sectors in their area for specific reasons, for example the improvement of education infrastructure in an area that has been hit by a natural disaster
Modifications such as these must be agreed to by the authorized official at the central level
Law No
33/2004 regulates that the allocation of DAK is determined according to three criteria, which involve general criteria, specific criteria, and technical criteria
(i) General criteria are based on consideration of a regional government's fiscal capacity, with priority given to regions whose discrepancy between general income and civil servant expenditure is zero or negative or below the national average based on the net fiscal index
(ii) Specific criteria are prepared with attention given to legislative regulation, such as special regional autonomy and regional characteristics, for example coastal, island, or border regions
(iii) Technical criteria are based on considerations determined by technical departments or national ministries using indicators that illustrate infrastructural characteristics in each sector
Furthermore, Article 42 of Law No
33/2004 orders the composition of a government regulation to especially regulate the management of DAK
However, to date the government has made no effort to issue such a regulation
Several cases have developed recently, such as the late ratification of the APBD and the holding of balance funds in the Bank Indonesia Certificate (SBI), which highlight the urgency for the immediate issue of a government regulation on the management of DAK
DAK cannot be distributed to regions before their APBD is ratified as it must be included in the APBD and the region is obliged to allocate co-funding (dana pendamping) to a minimum of 10% of the total DAK they receive
Holding funds as Bank Indonesia Certificates (SBI) impedes the APBD's function as an activator of regional real sector economies (see Box 2.1)
In addition, Article 108 of Law No
33/2004 states that deconcentration and coadministration funds forming a part of ministerial or state institution budgets used to implement matters that according to legislative regulations have become regional matters are to be transferred to DAK in stages
The law orders the central government to issue a government regulation to implement the transfer of these funds
Four years after the introduction of this legislation, there are no visible signs that the government will issue such a regulation
To date, not one district/city government official has paid attention to this issue
However, one provincial government staffer has conveyed their objection to regulations transferring deconcentration and co-administration funds to DAK
The reason that these balance funds are intended to help regional governments before they have sufficient fiscal capabilities
Hence balance funds, including DAK, should not be expected to keep growing; on the contrary, they should actually be reduced
The problem with that is that while various large sources of income are controlled by the central government, the majority of regional governments have not been able to obtain sufficient revenue to fund their activities
Several district staff consider that the provincial official's objection is based on the fact that deconcentration and co-administration funds are managed by provincial governments, while DAK is managed by district/city governments
Government Regulation No 55/2005 on Balance Funds is the only government regulation that regulates DAK, as DAK is a part of balance funds
DAK is specifically directed to the development, procurement, increasing, and/or improvement of physical infrastructure for basic community services with a long economic time span
To state their commitment and responsibilities, the regions have the authority to allocate co-funding from their APBD reaching a minimum of 10% of the total DAK they received
The Minister for National Development Planning, together with the Technical Ministers, have conducted monitoring and evaluation on the use and technical implementation of several DAK-funded activities, while the Ministry of Finance has conducted monitoring and evaluation of its fiscal management
DAK is allocated in the APBN according to the legislation on APBD and this allocation is in accordance with programs declared a national priority in the Presidential Decree on Government Work Plan (RKP) for the current year
Bappenas (2006) has made a comparison of the conformity of DAK-funded sectors with national development priorities based on the 2006 RKP
Table 2.2 shows that two sectors do not reflect the 2006 RKP
the environment and regional governance infrastructure
The other sectors only conform with the RKP in terms of their titles; there is no conformity between sectoral activities and the activity aims within each national development priority, with the exception of the infrastructure sector in the framework of supporting the increase of employment opportunities, investment, and exports (Bappenas 2006)
Starting in 2007, DAK sectors better conform to the development priorities and main activities set forth in the 2007 RKP (Table 2.3)
For example, the Nine Years of Compulsory Basic Education program was included in RKP activities to rehabilitate school buildings at the primary level (57% are damaged) and junior secondary level (27% are damaged)
In terms of education quality, the RKP stipulates activities for text book provision and the development of supporting facilities
On community health programs, among other efforts, the RKP formulated activities to increase the physical condition of puskesmas and the public health network, primarily in isolated, disadvantaged islands and border areas
On a different note, the RKP on road infrastructure as far as officially noted for roads and bridges rehabilitation/maintenance programs does not include activities that are appropriate for DAK funding
RKP generally contain activities covering stretches of national roads, while DAK is set aside for stretches of district/city roads (Bappenas 2006a)
Apart from considering general and specific criteria, the Ministry of Finance's calculation of DAK allocation considers technical criteria for specific activities upon the suggestion of the technical ministries
The specific activities are determined based on technical indexes for each sector after the relevant technical ministry coordinates with the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of National Development Planning
The following are the technical criteria for the three sectors that are samples in the study
Technical criteria for the education sector consist of (1) the number of classrooms in poor condition, (2) the number of primary schools and equivalent schools, and (3) construction cost index
The technical criteria for the health sector are (1) community poverty index, (2) regional area, (3) population, (4) the number of puskesmas, secondary puskesmas, village maternity posts, mobile puskesmas, and health office posts, and (5) construction cost index
Technical criteria for the road infrastructure sector consist of (1) the length of the district/city road, (2) the length of the damaged stretch of road, (2) district/city road performance, and (4) construction cost index
The outcome of DAK allocation calculations are molded in the Minister for Finance Regulation (PMK) on DAK Allocations and Management Guidelines by Region
According to Government Regulation No
55/2005, the Ministry of Finance must issue the PMK within 2 weeks from the ratification of the APBN legislation
Law No
18/2006 on the 2007 APBN was ratified on 17 October 2006, while the PMK on DAK 2007 was only issued on 15 December 2006, or 2 months later
So far, DAK allocation is still quite low; up to 2005, its proportion of the total APBN expenditure was below 1% (Table 2.4)
In an effort to increase the effectiveness of use of the limited funds, regional governments can form a DAK Activities Coordination Team, which coordinates the planning, implementation, reporting, and monitoring of DAK activities
This team is usually coordinated by a Bappeda official with members from each regional-level work unit to manage DAK
The coordination is intended to synchronize and create synergy for DAK's use so that it does not overlap with the use of DAK for other development activities
The coordination is also intended to create transparency, participation, and accountability for each DAK-funded activity
After receiving a DAK budget allocation document (SRAA), the regional head should arrange for a DAK utilization plan as set forth in the definitive plan (RD) and budget implementation statement (DIPA)
The head of the relevant regional office of the DJP is consulted with concerning the three documents
On the basis of the DIPA, the regional head issues a budget implementation document (DPA)/DIPA for the regional level work unit containing budget activities and allocations for each sector that receives funding
Figure 2.1 explains the verification process for the definitive plan which then becomes a DIPA
Regional governments are required to follow technical guidelines issued by technical ministries in the management of DAK-funded activities
According to Government Regulation No
55/2005, the technical ministry must determine the technical guidelines for the use of DAK at most 2 weeks after the Ministry of Finance determines DAK allocation
Below is a general picture of the three technical guidelines on the use of DAK in study samples (education, health, and road works)
Ministry of National Education Regulation No
4/2007 on Technical Guidelines for DAK's Implementation in the Education Sector Year 2007 was determined on 29 January 2007, or six weeks after the PMK on the 2007 DAK Allocation Determination was issued
Education sector DAK was allocated to support the implementation of the quality Nine Years of Compulsory Basic Education program
The activities were directed at (1) the rehabilitation of buildings/class rooms of primary schools and the equivalent—public, religious, state, or private schools, and (2) increasing the quality of basic education
The aims of DAK in the education sector are to realize transparent, professional, and accountable educational management, to actively involve the community, to push communities to become directly involved in the monitoring of educational activities, and to activate the economy in poor communities
The policy aims, among other things, to avoid overlapping with activities funded by the ministerial budget and the staged transfer of funding for activities that have become the regional matters from deconcentration and coadministration funds to DAK
In the process of DAK utilization, the Office of Education and the Office of the Ministry of Religion, together with district/city education boards, form the technical team assigned to select recipient schools, socialize the activities, and monitor its implementation
Besides this, the school principal, assisted by the school committee or madrasa council, is responsible for implementing activities at the school level
The implementation of activities at the school level is self-managed involving the school's local community
Funds are distributed to schools in entirety/in tact without deductions for tax from the regions to school bank accounts
Tax obligations are arranged by the school based on the valid regulations (see Appendix 7 for distribution, distribution mechanisms, and reporting of the use of DAK to the education sector)
As a follow-up to these technical guidelines, on 15 February 2007, the Directorate- General of Primary and Secondary Education issued Circular No
643/C/KU/2007 on DAK Implementation Guidelines in the Education Sector for the 2007 Fiscal Year (FY)
Then, on 16 February 2007, the director of Kindergarten and Primary School also issued Circular No
0123/C2/LL/2007 on Technical Specifications for Furniture, Educational Aids, Reference/Enrichment Books for Libraries, Multimedia Equipment and Library Facilities, and Preparation of DAK Activities Reports in the Education Sector for the 2007 Fiscal Year
The contents of both circulars are clear and detailed
If only regional DAK managers had carefully read them both, there would not be uniform measurements for student tables and chairs, only those appropriate for grade 1 students
If grade 3 and 4 students, let alone grade 5 and 6 students, use these chairs and tables, they would be forced to hunch
The physical consequences for these students after using such tables and chairs for years are easily imagined
Uniformity such as this is also found in the number of tables and chairs, which is set at 40 sets in each class, whereas many schools only have around 20 students per class; consequently, the surplus tables and chairs are simply stored in the back of the classroom
Other bungles involve the procurement of books to enrich student knowledge for the school library
There are schools that buy 100 sets of one title, whereas it would be better to provided ten sets of ten different titles
Therefore give students the opportunity to broaden their knowledge on a range of topics
Minister for Health Decree No
7/Menkes/SK/I/2007 on Technical Guidelines for the Use of DAK in the 2007 Fiscal Year was issued on 8 January 2007, 3 weeks after the issuance of the PMK on the 2007 DAK Allocation Determination
Health sector DAK was allocated for efforts to increase access to and the quality of health services
These activities were aimed at upgrading, rehabilitating, expanding, supplying, and developing various kinds of health service units and the procurement of medical equipment to increase basic health services
The distribution of DAK allocation in the health sector to puskesmas and the health network is determined by district heads (bupati) and mayors at the suggestion of the district/city Health Office
The funds are not distributed on an even basis; rather, priority is given to the fulfillment of user needs
Each district is required to prioritize village health posts (poskesdes) to best support the Alert Village Program
Bupati/mayors appoint health sector regional government work units to oversee DAK-funded health activities
Each quarter (in March, June, September, and December), bupati/mayors must submit a report on activities, physical and fiscal realizations, and any problems to the secretarygeneral of the Ministry of Finance
In March, districts/cities are also asked to send inventory data regarding all medical and health equipment in their region, including their condition, which will be used to gauge health sector DAK allocation for the following year (see the Appendix 10 for reporting mechanisms for the use of DAK)
Minister for Public Works Regulation No
39/PRT/M/2006 on Technical Guidelines for the Use of DAK in the Infrastructure Sector for Year 2007 was issued on 29 December 2006
The Minister for Public Works adhered to Government Regulation No
55/2005 by issuing the technical guidelines within 2 weeks after the PMK on the 2007 DAK Allocation Determination was issued
National priorities for DAK-funded road infrastructure activities are upgrading the integration of the road network, upgrading access to regions with economic potential (daerah potensial), opening up isolated and remote areas, and supporting the development of border areas
A minimum of 70% of the total road infrastructure DAK is allocated for periodic road maintenance (repairs to the body of the road and its foundations), and a maximum of 30% is set aside for upgrading roads
Routine maintenance and construction of new roads cannot be funded by DAK
Road infrastructure DAK is mainly allocated for periodic road maintenance and upgrading road and bridge infrastructure on stretches of road officially marked as district/city roads
The minister formed a coordination team and technical team at the ministry level to oversee the use of DAK, with the ministry providing special funding to cover their operational costs
At the provincial level, governors also form a coordinating team comprised of staff from Bappeda, relevant technical offices, and the central work unit in the region (Roads and Bridges Planning and Monitoring, P2JJ)
Bupati/mayors also form a coordinating team including Bappeda staff and other relevant offices to implement DAKfunded activities at the district/city level
The head of the regional government work unit responsible for road matters is given the physical and financial responsibility for the implementation of DAK-funded activities
An article in the Minister of Public Works regulation above contains sanctions for the implementation of DAK activities which are not carried out in accordance with the regulation in the form of performance evaluations to be issued in the ministerial report to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of National Development Planning, the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the House of Representatives
In order to give such an evaluation, the minister requires reports on the implementation of DAK activities in each recipient region
Reporting is done at different levels by the regional-level work unit (SKPD) head, the regional head, and the minister
With respect to this, Article 102 of Law No
33/2004 gives the Ministry of Finance authority to hand out sanctions in the form of deferred distribution of balance funds, including DAK, to regions that fail to fulfill the reporting requirements
Each deferment of funds distribution to the regions has a negative effect on the economic activities of the local people
Hence, this article ensures that the general populace bears the burden of sanctions for the wrongdoings of officials (see also Box 2.1)
2.3 DAK Regulations at the Regional-level 
It can be said that regional fiscal dependence on central government grants through balance funds has not changed even though decentralization and regional autonomy legislation has been reformed
As long as potentially large sources of national revenue are controlled by the central government, regional governments will continue to be dependent on the center
Although the amount of DAK is relatively small compared to the amount of DAU, most regions rely on DAK for expenditure capital (previously development expenditure), while a large proportion of DAU is used for civil servant and goods expenditure (previously routine expenditure)
The regions usually manage DAK according to central government regulations
Only several regions have issued regulations regarding the use of DAK adding to the details in the central regulations
Kabupaten Gorontalo is one of these regions, but the regulation is limited to the education sector
Each year, the bupati of Gorontalo issues Bupati Regulation on Technical Guidelines for the Implementation of DAK
regulating the self-management of DAK in the education sector regardless of the project value
The self-management of projects of an unlimited value breaches Presidential Decree No
80/2003, which imposes a value limit of Rp50 million for self-managed projects
The bupati has not issued technical guidelines for other sectors as Gorontalo manages DAK in all the other sectors in full accordance with the same presidential decree
Activities with a value more than Rp50 million are subject to open tender
The Regional Government of Kabupaten Kupang gives the community wider opportunities to participate in the procurement of goods and services
Under the Community Empowerment Program (PPM), each year the district issues PPM implementation guidelines via a bupati decree
The PPM gives the community room to work on APBD-funded projects up to the value of Rp250 million in a self-managed manner without being subject to tender (Bupati of Kupang Decree No
134/SKEP/HK/2007)
As DAK is a part of the APBD, regional governments must manage it in conjunction with the legislative elements (DPRD) in addition to complying with central government regulations on DAK
Box 2.1 provides an illustration of problems associated with obstacles for the use of DAK
The region is not the only source of obstacles
In many ways, the regional decision-making process depends on various decisions made at the central level
At the district/city level, budget priorities and limits for each SKPD are determined by general APBD policies that must have been prepared in the July of the previous year (Article 35 of Government Regulation No
58/2005)
However, the 2007 APBN, for example, was only confirmed in October 2006, while DAK allocations were only determined in December 2006 before the Technical Ministry could adjust the allocation to come into line with the technical guidelines for the use of DAK
Time clashes in the issuance of several interrelated decrees have caused repeated stalling in the preparation of regional budgets (see Table 2.5)
When the content of late-issued central decisions are different to regional estimations used in the formation of the APBD, many items in the budget plan must be reorganized or reevaluated and run past the DPRD again
Apart from wasting the time of regional officials, such a process wastes a significant amount of funds for regions with limited fiscal capacity
Generally speaking, regional governments are not in a position to suggest activities to be funded by DAK to the central government even though Article 162 of Law No
32/2004 makes it possible for regions to submit proposals
Regional governments only have the authority to submit and send data on the state of infrastructure and facilities in administrative sectors that obtain DAK allocation nationally
This data then becomes the basis upon which the central government (through the Ministry of Finance) allocates DAK to each region
Apart from using data from the regions, DAK allocation calculations also use data sourced from Statistics Indonesia (BPS)
Only after the regions are informed of their DAK allocation can regional governments plan its distribution to various activities in accordance with the central government stipulations
A criticism always emerged in focus group discussions (FGDs) regarding the weak database of data concerning various administrative sectors in the regions.15 This evaluation is usually based on the inappropriate selection of locations for DAK-funded activities
However, the assumption that the inappropriate selection of locations is solely caused by weak database is uncertain
for example, it may be caused by lobbying from specific interest groups
As another example, although DAK is not evenly distributed, several regions are forced to use an equality approach in order to avoid interregional social jealousies
When regional governments consider such an approach, the needs-based principle behind the concept of DAK tends to be ignored
III
ALLOCATION OF THE SPECIFIC ALLOCATION FUND 
One of the aims of DAK allocation is to increase the supply of physical infrastructure and facilities that fall under national priorities and to increase economic growth to harmonize interregional growth as well as intersectoral services
Since 2006, seven administrative services sectors have received DAK
education, health, infrastructure (including roads, irrigation, and clean water), government infrastructure, agriculture, maritime affairs and fisheries, and the environment
Among those seven sectors, education, health, and road infrastructure always receive the greatest share of DAK
The total DAK allocation for these sectors reaches around three quarters of the total DAK
As explained in Chapter 2, DAK is a modification of the Inpres Fund of the New Order era
Differences include that the Inpres Fund used two approaches
sectoral and regional
Sectoral Inpres funds comprised Inpres funds for primary schools, health, greening and reforestation, road upgrading, and markets
Regional Inpres funds comprised of provincial (Dati I) and district/city (Dati II) Inpres funds
Differing from the Inpres Fund, DAK is only allocated to districts and cities for specific sectors depending on national priorities as set forth in the RKP
At the beginning of fiscal decentralization, all DAK was sourced from reforestation funds (dana reboisasi or DR), totaling as much as 40% of the forestry sector revenue
Since 2003, in addition to using DAK to fund the development of the forestry sector, the government also uses DAK in other sectors to fulfill minimum service standards (SPM)
In 2006, the government transferred the reforestation funds component of DAK to the Shared Revenue Fund (DBH) because it had similar characteristics to the “according to its origin” DBH concept and reforestation fund DAK
Initially, Non-reforestation fund DAK was only allocated to four sectors
education, health, infrastructure, and government infrastructure
But in 2004, the government added the maritime affairs and fisheries sector, and in 2005, the agriculture sector was added
Since 2006, DAK funding has covered a total of seven sectors with the addition of the environment sector
DAK-funded sectors are added in accordance with developments in the RKP and form a reference for the national development plan
In this setting, the development of the total nominal of DAK in the APBN depends on national fiscal capacity
During 2001–2007, the total nominal and the proportion of DAK to gross domestic product (GDP) have increased in line with the GDP
The determination of the total amount of DAK and its allocation to the regions is based on the decision made between the DPR Budget Committee and the central government, including the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Home Affairs, Bappenas, and technical ministries within sectors receiving DAK allocations (Figure 3.1)
While the mechanism for the determination of DAK involves several institutions, the final decision regarding the total amount of DAK and its allocation per sector and per region rests with the Minister for Finance after consultations with the DPR
The other institutions only have a facilitating role
The role of the technical ministries, for example, is to provide technical data for each region in their respective sectors
According to a respondent in the Ministry of Finance, technical data for various sectors is not up-to-date; this becomes a constraint for efforts to accurately and appropriately calculate the allocation of DAK to the regions
A number of respondents stated that one of the factors causing the lack of available comprehensive data is the lack of accommodation of the results of musrenbang at the village and district/city levels
Chapter II notes that regions must fulfill general, specific, and technical criteria in order to be eligible to receive DAK
According to several respondents, the process and formula used for calculating DAK are relatively complex (see Box 3.1)
The details of the calculation process are not transparent and are difficult for the public to access
Many groups want the formula used for calculating DAK to be improved
In addition to reasons of transparency, an improved formula would be useful for the regions as they could apply it to estimate their DAK entitlements
3.1 DAK in the National Budget
Comparison of DAU, DAK, DBH, and Deconcentration and Co-administration Funds As the smallest component of balance funds, DAK makes a smaller contribution than DAU and DBH
Apart from this, the regulations regarding DAK are not as detailed as those regulating DAU and DBH
Under Law No
33/2004, the share of DAU has been determined at a minimum of 26% of the net domestic income
The law also details the formula used for the distribution of DBH between the central government and regional governments
In contrast to the detailed regulation of DAU and DBH, the same law only states that the amount of DAK will be determined annually in the APBN
The absence of articles and also government regulations specifically regulating DAK makes it a flexible component of balance funds
While on the one hand, this flexibility can be used as an instrument for harmonizing interregional balance funds
On the other hand, it causes uncertainty for regional governments as to the amount of DAK funding they will receive
In addition, the inexistence of a rule that arranges the amounts, proportions, or percentages of DAK in APBN also generates an impression that DAK in APBN is merely a residual budget
Table 3.1 shows that DAK has experienced significant increases from year to year, both in terms of nominal value and in terms of its relative value against DAU and DBH
During 2001–2007, its nominal value increased more than 24-fold, or 390% per year on average
When compared against the amount of DAU and DBH, DAK's relative value also experienced a significant increase
Against DAU, DAK increased from 1.2% in 2001 to 10.4% in 2007, whilst against DBH, it increased from 3.5% in 2001 to 25% in 2007
Apart from being caused by budget increases in each DAK-funded sector, the increase was a result of the expanding scope of DAK-funded sectors and an increase in the number of recipient districts/cities
In 2007, for example, there should have been 87 districts/cities that did not receive DAK
However, in a compromise between the central government and the DPR, all 87 regions ended up receiving it
Despite the nominal increases from year to year, the total value of DAK is still very low when compared to the entire APBN
During 2001–2007, the highest percentage of DAK against the total APBN expenditure was 2.2% in 2007 and 2.4% of the total APBN revenue, also in 2007
Apart from the balance funds in the form of DAU, DBH, and DAK, the central government also currently allocates deconcentration and co-administration funds to the regions
Both deconcentration and co-administration funds come from the APBN, but they are not part of the balance funds
Deconcentration funds are sourced from ministerial/institutional funds handed out to governors as representatives of the central government in the regions
Technically, the allocation of these funds to the regions is handled by provincial government offices (dinas)
As an example, in 2007, the Directorate-General of Primary and Secondary Education handled deconcentration funds to the value of Rp19.85 trillion, Rp16.379 trillion of which was transferred to provincial education offices for activities under the Nine Years of Compulsory Basic Education program
Co-administration funds are disbursed to regional governments or village administrations and are the direct responsibility of the central government
The combined total of deconcentration and co-administration funds is far greater than the total of DAK
In March 2006, for example, the total of these funds for all provinces reached Rp30.5 trillion, or around three times as much as the total DAK (see Appendix 1 and Appendix 2)
This figure was a sharp increase from the previous year's figure of only Rp9.9 trillion
Rp4 trillion for deconcentration funds and Rp5.9 trillion for co-administration funds
In a link between these two fund sources and DAK, Article 108 of Law No
33/2004 states that deconcentration and co-administration funds are to be transferred in stages to DAK
Following from this, it is estimated that the total amount of DAK is set to increase in the future
If it is assumed that the 2007 totals for deconcentration and co-administration funds will be the same as the 2006 totals, and that they will all be transferred to DAK, the total DAK figure for 2007 will grow to Rp47.1 trillion, or equivalent to 6.2% of the APBN expenditure
There are strong reasons for the transfer of deconcentration and co-administration funds to DAK as both funds share the same fundamental objective as DAK
All three funds are intended to fund various activities in administrative services that are now regional matters, but that are not yet sufficient, at least according to minimum service standards
The similar aims of the funds can be seen by the high correlation figures between the two
Table 3.2 shows that the allocation per province of the two groups of funds has a correlation of 0.7387, indicating that it is highly likely that similar parameters are used in the basic consideration of the allocations of DAK and the deconcentration and co-administration funds
The correlation figures for both the per capita allocation of DAK and deconcentration and co-administration funds with the Human Development Index (HDI) for each province are low, –0.3364 and –0.3228 respectively
If HDI figures can be considered as a picture of, or to be as related to, the condition of public services in a particular region, the allocation policies for both types of funds go against the objective of ironing out interregional discrepancies in public service conditions
In other words, the allocation practices for both types of funds will not reduce the large gaps in public service provision between the regions
Table 3.2 also shows the high correlation figures for the allocation of DAK from 2005 to 2007, indicating that the policies and basis of consideration for DAK's allocation do not change from year to year
3.2 DAK Allocation by Priority Sector 
Consistent with DAK's flexibility, the central government appoints DAK recipient sectors in accordance with their priorities as set out in the government work plan for the particular year
Changes to development priorities as noted in the RKP will be reflected in changes to the sectors and activities to which DAK is channeled
To demonstrate, in 2007, the government placed a high priority on development in the education sector, and as a result, this sector received the greatest DAK allocation
In 2005 and 2006, in accordance with the development priorities for those years, infrastructure development received the largest share of DAK (Table 3.3)
Furthermore, since 2005, the government has divided the infrastructure sector into three subsectors—road infrastructure, irrigation infrastructure, and clean water infrastructure
Road infrastructure receiving a greater allocation than the other subsectors
Based on RKPs, the seven sectors that receive DAK allocations have a direct impact on the attainment of national development priorities, which among others involve poverty and inequality reduction, an increase in employment opportunities, investment and exports support, an increase in the accessibility and quality of education and health facilities, and bureaucratic reform
Over the span of 2003–2007, the highest increase of total DAK occurred during 2005– 2006 (188%), as a result of a significant increase in DAK allocations across all sectors (Table 3.4)
Sectors giving the highest contribution to this increase, with individual increases of over 200%, are agriculture (544%), health (288%), and government infrastructure (203%)
It is highly likely that the increase in the agriculture sector is linked to the central government's current policy of revitalization of the sector
Over the period 2006–2007, the environment sector received the greatest increase, at 216%
The increasing level of environmental destruction has resulted in various disasters such as flooding and landslides, evidently the primary reason for the increase in DAK allocation for that sector
In the cases of the education, health, and infrastructure sectors, earlier in the report it is stated that these sectors have absorbed the dominant share of DAK funding
On the one side, this indicates that the government is placing a greater emphasis on the development of those three sectors
However, it also suggests that the physical infrastructure of these sectors is in such a poor state that the sectors require large amounts of funding before any improvements can be made
In line with DAK's objective to reduce interregional service inequalities (by reducing interregional fiscal inequality), the worse the condition of service infrastructure in a region, the more DAK the region should receive
The reverse also follows; regions with a better state of service infrastructure should receive relatively smaller share of DAK
While this simple principle cannot entirely reveal the effectiveness of DAK allocation, at least it gives an initial indication of the efficiency of the DAK allocation for a particular region
To find out the accuracy of DAK allocation for a particular region, Table 3.5 presents calculation results of correlations between DAK allocations per province and the levels of indicators of physical infrastructure condition in the three sectors that this study focuses on
In the basic education sector, the indicator is the number of classrooms with heavy damage
The health sector uses the population ratio per puskesmas/secondary puskesmas, and the indicator for road infrastructure is the presence of roads that can be accessed by vehicles with four or more wheels
The results of the correlation calculations between per capita DAK allocations and the indicators in the basic education and road infrastructure indicate that the correlation value is in line with the DAK objectives, but not in the health sector
In the education sector, the correlation figure is positive
the higher the number of damaged classrooms in a particular province, the higher the total DAK allocation for the education sector in the relevant province
In the road infrastructure sector, the correlation figures are negative, indicating that the lower the ratio of roads accessible by vehicles with four or more wheels, the higher the DAK allocation is for this sector
Although generally DAK allocations for basic education and road infrastructure have been on target, Table 3.5 shows that the correlation is still quite low, at around 0.5
In the education sector, the correlation figure between both variables reaches as high as +0.4649
The same thing happens in the road infrastructure sector, which has the correlation value of -0.5122
This figure indicates that some consideration is given to factors other than the road conditions in the relevant regions
The correlation value in the health sector is - 0.6360
This figure means that the DAK allocation in the health sector is not based on the consideration of the number of population that has to be served by each puskesmas or secondary puskesmas
3.3 DAK Allocations in the Sample Districts/City The sample districts and city in this study have differing levels of socioeconomic development
In 2005, the per capita gross regional domestic product (GRDP) figure for Kota Banda Aceh, for example, reached Rp11.5 million, while the figure for Kabupaten Gorontalo was Rp1.8 million
The poverty levels in the four regions also show fairly significant differences
Data for 2004 shows that the poverty figures in Kota Banda Aceh and Kabupaten Wonogiri were 21.2% and 24.4% respectively, lower than the figures in Kabupaten Gorontalo and Kabupaten Kupang, which reached 33.5% and 32.7%
In line with these poverty figures, for the same year, the HDI for Kota Banda Aceh was the highest (74.7) and the lowest figure (62) was for Kabupaten Kupang
The KPPOD evaluation (2005) of the four districts/city also shows differences in the character of their administrative institutions
Kabupaten Gorontalo received a value of A for aspects of local leadership and regional regulations, while in Wonogiri both aspects were only given a value of C (Table 3.6)
Based on differing regional conditions such as those above, the size of DAK allocation for each sample region is also different
During 2003–2007, the total DAK received by Kota Banda Aceh, Kabupaten Wonogiri, Kabupaten Gorontalo, and Kabupaten Kupang respectively reached Rp84.3 billion, Rp116.3 billion, 124.0 billion, and Rp129.6 billion (Table 3.6)
Reflecting the national increase in total DAK, DAK gains for the sample districts and city also experienced a significant increase
In 2003–2007, DAK gains for Kabupaten Wonogiri, Kabupaten Gorontalo, Kabupaten Kupang, and Kota Banda Aceh respectively increased by 164%, 124%, 116%, and 76%
With the exception of Kabupaten Wonogiri, the proportionate increases in the sample areas are still lower than the national increase in total DAK of 163% per year
For all sample regions, DAK has played an increasingly important role as a source of regional revenue from year to year, exceeding that of locally-derived revenues (PAD)
In 2003, the average total of DAK for the four sample districts and city had reached 66% of their total PAD allocation
In 2006, the figure increased to 212%, meaning that the growth in DAK allocation far exceeded the growth of PAD
These conditions gave DAK an increasingly important role in the APBD
In 2003, the average contribution of DAK to the APBD of the sample districts and city was 3.2%, but by 2006, it had increased to 7.2% (Table 3.7)
Apart from its role in supporting regional income, DAK plays an important role in increasing the capital expenditure capacity of regional governments, which tends to continually increase from year to year (Table 3.7)
In 2003, DAK's average contribution to the capital expenditure capacity of the sample districts/city was 18.1%
The figure continued to increase in the following years and in 2006, the figure had reached 36.8%
In 2006, in Kabupaten Gorontalo, it even reached 61.3%
This development illustrates how regional development has become ever more dependent on DAK
If this tendency continues, there is the possibility that the substance of regional autonomy, which provides regions with the independence to form development policies appropriate for regional needs and priorities, will be lost
The use of a large share of the DAK allocated to the sample districts and city follows the national priorities for DAK
the education, health, and road infrastructure sectors
During 2005–2007, the total proportions for DAK in all sample districts/city for the three sectors were 68.5%, 71.3%, and 71.8% in the respective years (Table 3.8)
Nevertheless, several differences appear when it is looked at from the priorities in the different districts/city
Kabupaten Kupang and Kabupaten Gorontalo had increases in their allocation to DAK for the three sectors, from 50.1% and 64.1% respectively in 2005 to 66.5% and 73.6% in 2007
In Kota Banda Aceh, however, the proportion of DAK for the sectors fell from 88.5% in 2005 to 76.3% in 2007, and in Kabupaten Wonogiri, the figures were relatively stable at around 72% (Table 3.8)
The decline in the proportion of DAK used in the three sectors in Kota Banda Aceh does not indicate that the city shifted its priorities for the use of DAK
the city received a significant amount of additional DAK for the agriculture sector, thereby reducing the total proportion for the other sectors
In 2005, Kota Banda Aceh was not allocated the DAK for the agricultural sector, but in 2006 and 2007 respectively, the sector was allocated Rp2.54 billion and Rp3.03 billion (Appendix 3)
IV
USE OF THE SPECIFIC ALLOCATION FUND
TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND PARTICIPATION 
In the efforts to balance finances between the centre and the regions, while DAK really only acts as an additional type of balance funds, 
It has become increasingly important to the regions for their development
As DAU, the main component of balance funds, is generally only enough to fulfill the needs for bureaucratic expenditure
the use of DAK in the regions has become a key factor supporting regional development in particular and national development in general
Apart from DAK, deconcentration and co-administration funds are also sources of funding for development projects in specific districts and cities
However, in contrast to DAK, these funds are not part of the balance funds and therefore they do not form part of the district/city APBD
On the one hand, for district/city governments, DAK is more transparent and offers more certainty for development funding than deconcentration and co-administration funds
On the other hand, open selection criteria are not used in fund allocation for projects that use deconcentration and co-administration funds
regional governments cannot estimate the possibility that they will receive these funds
Whether or not a region will receive these funds is highly dependent on the policies of the technical ministry that holds the funds
As part of the APBD, DAK falls under the authority of regional governments
Nevertheless, giving the reason that regional governments are to use DAK in accordance with national priorities, the central government regulated the use of DAK in several regulations, such as the technical guidelines issued in several regulations from the minister for finance and technical ministries
Since decentralization and regional autonomy in 2001, the number of DAK-funded sectors has risen
While initially DAK was limited to funding reforestation, over the following years, the government widened DAK's scope to other sectors in accordance with the national priorities as stated in the RKP
As of 2007, seven sectors of governance services are covered
Based on the background, scope, and definition of DAK as stated in the introductory chapter, the government's decision to increase the scope of DAK-funded sectors has been interpreted in various ways, including those that follow
(i) The DAU and DBH formulas have failed to fulfill their function as the main components of the balance funds
It has often come to the attention of regional government circles that the sense of the word “khusus” (specific) that has stuck to DAK will be increasingly lost as more sectors receive DAK funding
(ii) Regional government development performance in at least the seven DAK-funded sectors is still low
This forces the central government to become involved with the development of those sectors
The sample districts and city generally stated that their “powerlessness” in the development of the DAK-funded sectors is not because they do not care; rather, it is due to nothing other than funding constraints
The fact that the majority of the balance funds in the form of DAU and DBH is only sufficient for fulfilling routine bureaucratic expenses, as previously stated, means that only a limited amount of funding remains for development
(iii) The central government's priorities have expanded
When viewed from the aspect of development in general, their role in developing the various sectors is positive
Nevertheless, when viewed from the perspective of decentralization and regional autonomy, the government's growing intervention in regional government affairs has negative implications
Efforts to place regional governments as important entities in regional development have become blurred
The broadened scope of activities and the increase in the total DAK for regions are accompanied by the limitation of “what is allowed and what is not allowed”; this limits the authority of regional governments
Conversely, central government authority is becoming stronger
If the number of sectors that use DAK mechanisms for their development continues to increase, intentionally or not, centralization politics will slowly take over from decentralization policy
Therefore, the various regional government circles are not entirely wrong to claim that any remaining regional autonomy only exists in the words of legislation
In practice, the extent of regional government authority is narrowing
Furthermore, the following section analyzes regional government practices in the use of DAK in the three sectors that this study focuses on
health, education, and road infrastructure
4.1 Development Planning and Examination of DAK 
4.1.1 Development Planning In 2004, the government ratified Law No
25/2004 on National Development Planning Systems
To implement this legislation, on 20 January 2005 Bappenas and the Ministry of Home Affairs issued Joint Circular No
0259/M.PPN/I/2005.050/166/SJ on Technical Guidelines on the Organization of Development Planning Community Consultative Meetings (musrenbang)
Normatively, the existence of this law as well as the rules for its implementation reconfirms the need for a more participative development planning process
The musrenbang model is not in fact a new mechanism as regional governments have been using it since the time of the New Order administration
In all sample regions, with the exception of Kota Banda Aceh, regional governments hold a musrenbang each year and it has become the sole mechanism for capturing community aspirations in the process of development planning preparation
Every year, the musrenbang series usually starts in January (at the village level) and ends around April or May (at the district level)
In Kota Banda Aceh, musrenbang are only held once in 5 years when the city government is preparing its strategic plan
The community no longer participates in the spelling out of the strategic plans in annual work plans or the APBD with the reason that community aspirations are accommodated in the strategic plan
According to a Bappeda Kota Banda Aceh staff, the process of drafting the APBD and/or implementing annual development plans is technical and accordingly, the community does not need to be involved
The musrenbang conducted in preparation for district/city development planning are basically a form for gathering community suggestions
In district-level musrenbang, Bappeda then merges the suggestions with sectoral planning for each SKPD
The result of this amalgamation becomes the district or city's development planning document
During this stage, regional governments start to map out possible sources of funding for the various activities, that is, via DAU, PAD, DAK, or deconcentration and co-administration funds
The document is then taken to the provinciallevel musrenbang
The provincial development planning document resulting from the provincial musrenbang is then used as the provincial government's reference for the national musrenbang
Although the musrenbang model has been used since the New Order administration, some groups in the regions—mainly nongovernment groups—still question its effectiveness in the birth of a participatory development planning process
They consider that the musrenbang process is more inclined to put forward representative mechanisms that do not truly reflect community aspirations with a significant risk of elite capture
It is actually quite possible that suggestions are put forward in the name of community interests, 
they actually represent the interests of elite groups
The analysis above shows that the receipt of DAK in a particular region is not linked to the regional development planning process, particularly musrenbang
In this context, regional governments really only have a passive role in the allocation of DAK
It is therefore understandable if regional government circles state their dissatisfaction with the entire DAK allocation process
The results of FGDs in four districts/city all reflect the dissatisfaction of the aforementioned regional government official
On the aspect of DAK management planning, FGD participants placed the planning stage at the sixth (lowest) ranking compared to other stages of the DAK management process (Table 4.1 and Appendix 5)
The FGD participants' rather low evaluations of the planning aspect of DAK were generally based on the following reasons
(i) The database on the condition of infrastructure in the regions was not up-to-date, particularly in the health and education sectors
(ii) The discussion of the results of village- and subdistrict-level musrenbang at the SKPD level is closed
(iii) The regional government does not have a significant role in the planning of the use of DAK as its use has been limited by central government stipulations
In contrast to what the other sample districts' FGD participants saw, FGD participants in Kabupaten Gorontalo saw the development planning process in general, not only with regard to the DAK planning
They considered that the musrenbang process right up to the preparation of the development planning document reflects a participatory, accountable, and transparent mechanism
The district government has also made an effort to explain to various communities that their suggestions are not yet accommodated in development planning
Based on this evaluation, FGD participants gave the development planning process in Kabupaten Gorontalo a fairly high evaluation
4.1.2 Problems Surrounding the Allocation of DAK to Regions
There is actually no direct relationship between the development planning practices in districts/cities and the pattern of the central government's determination of DAK
There are several reasons for this
Firstly, district/city development plans that also encompass planned funding sources from DAK will come to rest at the provincial level
Secondly, the provincial-level development planning document taken to the national musrenbang is a synthesis of district/city development planning, not a compilation of the plans of each respective district/city
Thirdly, the central government uses its own guidelines (based on the three criteria previously mentioned) when allocating DAK to the districts/cities
It is interesting to note that although the central government possesses the criteria and basic formula for the allocation of DAK to the regions, some regional government officials are of the opinion that there is room to lobby the central government
In other words, regional governments can influence the central government in matters of DAK allocation to specific regions
In Kabupaten Kupang and Kabupaten Gorontalo, for example, several respondents claimed that the bupati played “a big role” in the increase in DAK funding to their districts
Apart from “direct intervention” from the bupati, several respondents also stated that their respective SKPD took their activities plan straight to Jakarta to obtain DAK
They referred to this step as “escorting the proposal to the center”
Central government officials offer different explanations for the above phenomenon
In one group, a respondent in a technical ministry stated that their ministry indeed summons the relevant SKPD, both at the district/city and provincial levels, every year for the purpose of obtaining explanations regarding the relevant office's entire development plan
Keeping in mind that such meetings are usually held before DAK allocations are determined, the impression that emerges is that central government and regional government officials come to some form of an “agreement”
In another group, a central government official respondent in fact admitted that regional governments lobby to obtain DAK
According to the respondent, this occurs due to the lack of transparency surrounding the management of DAK
The determination of allocations is inclined to be bias to the point where the possibility of “dagang sapi” (cow-trading), or bargaining between shady central government and regional government officials by lobbying the technical ministries or Ministry of Finance, has emerged
The emergence of the term “duta daerah di Jakarta” (regional ambassador in Jakarta) is perhaps a direct indication of the aforementioned deal making
On another aspect, DPR members fighting to represent the interests of their electorates also intensify the DAK “percaloan” (brokering)
As an example of the lack of transparency, Kota Banda Aceh received far more DAK (Rp3.027 billion) for the agriculture sector than for the maritime affairs and fisheries sector, whereas the city's agricultural potential is smaller than its maritime and fisheries potential (see Ministry of Finance Regulation No
128/PMK.07/2006)
Such peculiarities add to the proof of how difficult it is to coordinate technical ministries even though there is a coordinating minister
Aside from this phenomenon, some regional government officials also stated that there is not really a direct relationship between district/city development planning 
The allocation of DAK funds, which is the sole responsibility of the central government based on the specific criteria
In addition, the role of the SKPD is only to provide data to the relevant technical ministry
As such, if a particular district/city SKPD goes to Jakarta before the DAK allocation has been determined, it is only doing so to distribute data to the relevant ministry
Regional governments only have a passive role in DAK allocation
In fact, one respondent in Kabupaten Kupang stated, “While regional governments do not take any measures, the central government will still give DAK to the region.” Thus far, the Kabupaten Kupang Health Office, for example, has not taken any special measures to make a DAK planning strategy or proposal to fund their activities plan
The allocation of funds and its sources depends on Kabupaten Kupang's government policies
An examination of Law No
32/2004 and Law No
33/2004 seems to confirm the various perceptions on DAK that emerged from regional government circles as noted above
Under Law No
32/2004, DAK allocation demands a bottom-up approach based on regional government proposals
According to respondents from the Ministry of Finance and Bappenas, at the beginning of the regional autonomy, the central government had tried to apply bottom-up mechanisms
However, as the proposals from the regions tended to be irrational in terms of the exorbitant total cost of the proposals, the central government did not continue with that approach
Instead,  in Law No
33/2004, under which the division of DAK fundamentally follows top-down mechanisms
Normatively, although the allocation of DAK uses a top-down approach, the process uses objective mechanisms
The technical ministries, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Home Affairs, Bappenas, and the DPR all have intensive roles in DAK's allocation in accordance with their respective functions
However, in practice, according to a Bappenas respondent, the allocation of DAK is the domain of the Ministry of Finance and the relevant technical departments, while the Ministry of Home Affairs and Bappenas are not actively involved
The respondent also suggested that a particular consequence of this process for regional governments is that they do not know how much DAK that they will be receiving when they are preparing the APBD
complicating the budget preparation process in the regions
Another respondent from a technical ministry offered a different explanation
Since decentralization, their ministry had not been involved in the determination of DAK allocation
According to the respondent, the technical ministry's role is no more than providing requested technical data to the Ministry of Finance
the Ministry of Finance together with Bappenas fully determine DAK allocation for both individual sectors and regions
According to this respondent, to determine the total budget in each sector, the Ministry of Finance obtains input from Bappenas and technical departments so that the outcome is in accordance with the RKP
The draft allocation determination is then reviewed by the DPR Budget Committee
After the DPR agrees to the total DAK and its allocation, the Ministry of Finance coordinates with the technical department and keeps Bappenas and the Ministry of Home Affairs informed
Then, in accordance with Government Regulation No
55/2005, the final decision for the sectoral determination as well as the determination of DAK for each region falls under the authority of the Ministry of Finance
The above analysis indicates that in practice, there is no consensus surrounding DAK allocation mechanisms within either central or regional governments
Such circumstances allow for differing perceptions on both the constraints of discourse and the “lobbying efforts” to receive DAK, which itself requires a fair amount of funds
If it is indeed true that lobbying efforts can influence DAK gains, perhaps it can still be understood from the cost benefit aspect
However, if in fact the DAK allocation process truly follows the prevailing game rules and hence cannot be influenced by lobbying from regions, those efforts are merely the arena of deception of people who claim they are able to influence DAK gains
The intense issue of “percaloan anggaran” (“budget brokering”) in the past is the phenomena behind the chaotic allocation practices for DAK and the other types of balance funds
In the regions, the issue of budget brokering is not only noted in the discourse, but rather, it has become a matter of fact
One nongovernment organization (NGO) respondent in Kota Banda Aceh, for example, pointed out a copy of an official document from Kabupaten X (signed by the bupati) which contained details of “cooperation” between Kabupaten X and company Y based in Jakarta
The document stated that Kabupaten X had assigned PT
Y in Jakarta to take care of DAK allocation for maritime affairs and fisheries
When the assignment was achieved, PT
Y would be compensated in the form of a fee of 10% of the total DAK that Kabupaten X received
4.2 Determination of Allocations and Project Types 
Several central government officials stated that while the central government has the authority to determine DAK allocations, regional governments still have some freedom to use the funds in accordance with their autonomy
In the education sector, for example, regional governments have full authority to determine which schools will receive DAK allocations
the Ministry of Public Works has determined that in FY 2006, a minimum of 70% of the total DAK for road infrastructure may be used for periodic road maintenance and a maximum of 30% is to be used for road upgrading
The Ministry of Education has also outlined that in 2007, 60% of DAK must be used for the restoration of primary-level school buildings and the remaining 40% should be used to upgrade education quality
4.2.1 Determination of Project Location Each sample district and city stated that they use a participatory approach within the musrenbang forum to determine the location of DAK-funded projects based on a scale of priorities
Not all development activities proposed by the community can be realized
Apart from the obvious funding limitations, several regional government officials stated that this is because community suggestions are often not appropriate for the overall regional development framework
However, whatever the reason, the emerging impression is that the musrenbang process is not an effective mechanism for participatory development planning
In practice, regional governments decide on DAK project locations according to SKPD plans rather than proposals from the community
Within certain limits, nepotism and personal ties between government bureaucrats and project recipients, such as school principals or puskesmas heads, can sway project determinations
Consequently, it is not unusual for the process to become polemic within the community
In Kabupaten Wonogiri, for example, in 2006 the DPRD conducted an audit and they came across five primary schools that should not have received DAK
The schools had used the funds to build new classrooms, not to rehabilitate existing buildings
In 2007, even more plans for primary school restoration are not appropriate
The DPRD decided to cancel 29 of the 88 restoration plans submitted by the Education Office as they did not fulfill the conditions and instead the projects were relocated to other primary schools
According to one DPRD member, the determination of recipient primary schools can be inappropriate partly due to the existence of personal ties between school groups (principals or school committees) and bureaucrats in the subdistrict or district/city branches of the Education Office
Possibly related to the problem of personal ties, one primary school that received DAK in Kota Banda Aceh in 2006 was bold enough to exceed the DAK spending limit
To cover the shortfall in funds, the school committee obtained credit from a building materials supplier
The school committee was convinced that they would obtain DAK again in 2007 in order to pay off their debt
Kabupaten Gorontalo and Kabupaten Kupang also experienced problems surrounding the determination of DAK project locations
One NGO active in the education sector in Kabupaten Gorontalo stated that among all the management aspects of DAK, project location determination is the most troubled by collusion
As an example, one primary school had submitted a proposal for building restoration for five years running, but they had not yet obtained DAK
On the other hand, one school had received DAK in two successive years
Apart from that, one school received DAK assistance as well as deconcentration funds assistance
One NGO in Kupang also expressed that the determination of DAK project locations was a site of collusion
In this case, one school had definitively obtained a DAK allocation based on a bupati decree; however, that decision was overturned by another bupati decree
According to one respondent, this occurred because one party had tried to persuade the school principle to employ a specific contractor to carry out the project
However, because the school principle did not agree, the school's DAK allocation was transferred to another school
Notwithstanding the fact that the DAK project location determination process is not completely objective or transparent
FGD participants gave it a relatively good evaluation, ranking the participation in the process in the third position compared to the other stages (see Table 4.1 and Appendix 5)
This evaluation is perhaps more of an indication of the greater role that the SKPD plays in project allocation determination rather than an a reflection of the participants' satisfaction regarding the role that the community plays via the musrenbang process
4.2.2 Problems Surrounding the Technical Guidelines Sample district/city governments stated that the uniformity and rigidity of the technical guidelines to the point that conditions in specific regions are ignored are among the main problems surrounding the use of DAK
As a consequence, the regions cannot use DAK to maximum efficiency in accordance with their interests; in fact, counterproductive conditions can emerge
The strict technical guidelines accompanying the DAK allocation are an indication that the central government does not really aspire to full regional autonomy
To comment on views such as this, central government circles generally stated that the strict regulation on the use of DAK is one of the central government's controls over regional governments, apart from being based on theory and legality
If regional governments had full discretion over the use of DAK, the central government would be afraid that many regions would spend DAK on bureaucratic interests as it has happened with DAU
Aside from the different opinions concerning the DAK technical guidelines, the following section provides several regional government problems in putting the technical guidelines into effect
(i) Technical guidelines that are inappropriate for regional conditions Sectorally, technical guidelines are often inappropriate for regional conditions
In Kabupaten Kupang, for instance, the majority of road surfaces are still earth or have not been asphalted
However, the technical guidelines direct that 70% of the DAK for road infrastructure must be used for maintenance and only 30% may be used to upgrade road conditions
This certainly is not fitting for the requirements in Kabupaten Kupang, which is more in need of funds for road upgrading activities
In Kota Banda Aceh, a different issue arises
DAK allocation in the education sector may only be used to fund the restoration of existing primary school buildings, whereas almost all primary school buildings in the city that were destroyed as a result of the tsunami have been rebuilt by the Rehabilitation and Construction Body (BRR) and other various domestic and international aid institutions
As a result, DAK is being used to renovate primary school buildings that are still technically in good condition
Another problem uncovered is the determination of standard cost units
In 2006, the central government determined a standard package of Rp150 million to restore three classrooms, whereas the level of damage in each school is different
Some schools may only require one classroom to be repaired whilst another may have six classrooms with major damage
In this context, regional governments suggested that the primary school building restoration funding packages as far as possible be adapted to reflect the needs of each school
While schools that only require one classroom to be renovated do not require sufficient funding for three classrooms
Schools with six classrooms in need of renovation do need to be given a sufficient level of funding to renovate all of those classrooms
Under the current system, if a school is given the standard package for three classrooms, it is difficult for them to obtain another package in the following year even if they still have classrooms in need of repair
Apart from that, the uniform package amount of Rp50 million per classroom does not reflect the true conditions in the field
In Kabupaten Kupang alone, there are three zones for the construction materials price index
Uniformity in the technical guidelines for the procurement of supplementary equipment to increase education quality as well as medical equipment also causes the ineffective use of DAK funds
Several more cases illustrating this point are noted below
Typewriter procurement As part of the package to improve education quality, the central government requires all schools (cases from Kabupaten Wonogiri and Kabupaten Gorontalo) to receive a package of Rp1.55 million for a typewriter
According to one respondent in the region, the central government has stipulated that the typewriter must have the letter beta (b)
In both Kabupaten Wonogiri and Kabupaten Gorontalo, the typewriter fulfilling those requirements is the “Royal–Special School Edition”
Several respondents questioned the effectiveness of using a typewriter for school administration
Schools in urban regions are more in need of a computer than a typewriter
In one primary school in Kabupaten Wonogiri, the typewriter is only stored in the corner (Appendix 12)
The teachers have never used it as the school has a computer
Book procurement The package for supporting books that schools receive does not reflect school needs
One primary school in Kabupaten Wonogiri with only 92 students has 200 copies of one book title
In connection with this, the school committee questioned why the Education Office entrusted the school to carry out school building improvements while the task of procuring supporting materials for education quality had been given to a third party
Vaccine refrigerator procurement A similar story is found in the health sector
For the procurement of vaccine refrigerators, for instance, according to the technical guidelines, a puskesmas must buy a refrigerator with certain specifications priced up to Rp30 million per unit, whereas according to the puskesmas doctor, vaccines can be stored in an ordinary refrigerator costing far less
Ironically, the specifications for the rehabilitation of puskesmas buildings do not include the provision of electricity installations or medical waste disposal facilities
(ii) Staged funds disbursement The staged DAK funds disbursement process is not appropriate for the conditions in several regions
In the case of Kota Banda Aceh, the majority of offices or technical agencies using the DAK budget had not submitted requests that the funds be paid in stages according to project progress
They generally only submit the payment request once the project or activity has been completed
This is usually the case as contractors do not submit invoices according to the project's progress
To date, a large share of contractors choose to finish the job or project entirely before submitting their invoice
According to several respondents within the Kota Banda Aceh government, contractors choose this approach to avoid the administrative bureaucracy of repeated funds disbursements
Commenting on this issue, one FGD participant stated, “Contractors do not want to disburse funds a number of times as each disbursement requires a fee.” In Kabupaten Kupang and Kabupaten Gorontalo, which cover wide regions, regional government officials also highlighted the staged funds disbursement mechanism as an inefficient policy, mainly for isolated regions with poor road infrastructure
Such conditions frequently cause delays in administrative procedures which culminate the late completion of projects
For the self-managed construction of primary school buildings, as an example, each funds disbursement process requires signatures from the school committee, the subdistrict public works officer, and the education office branch head
If one of these people does not sign the invoice, for instance, because they are not available, the disbursement process is held up
Although several respondents criticized the DAK disbursement mechanisms, FGD participants actually rated it the highest of all other aspects of the DAK management (see Table 4.1 and Appendix 5)
(iii) Delays in the issue of the technical guidelines All the sample regional governments protested the central government's delays in issuing the technical guidelines for DAK utilization
Firstly, regional governments cannot immediately begin DAK-funded development activities, and secondly, there is the possibility that planned development activities to be funded by DAK and already allocated in the APBD are not in accordance with the technical guidelines
If the second issue arises, regional governments are forced to submit a request for exception to the relevant technical ministry or readjust their APBD
A readjustment can waste a significant amount of funds and time as the executive must prepare the revisions and then reconsult them with the DPRD
Under such conditions, regional governments are inclined to conduct the adjustments when they are working on the Revised APBD (APBD-P) usually in August
As a consequence, the implementation time for DAK-funded projects is diminished and this affects the quality of the activities
4.3 Project Implementation In all the sample regions, DAK-funded construction projects are usually either selfmanaged (swakelola) or put out to tender
In the education sector, the Ministry of National Education has stipulated that all primary school rehabilitation projects are to be selfmanaged
The principal and/or the school committee are the program implementers
The self-management system is the same as direct appointment
One respondent in the Ministry of National Education suggested that the self-manage construction system is part of the philosophy of the national education management, that is, that education is the responsibility of the government and the community
By adopting this approach, the ministry hopes that the community can contribute to the development of the physical education infrastructure
Contrasting that policy, the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Public Works have stipulated that DAK projects are to adopt the tender process
In the sample districts and city, both the self-managed and tender systems are working well for construction activities
Visually, the construction quality in primary schools, puskesmas, and roads seems to be good
Hence, FGD participants rated the implementation of DAK projects as second after funds disbursement (see Table 4.1 and Appendix 5)
Notes on the implementation of self-managed projects (proyek swakelola) From one perspective, the self-managed system has been able to reduce the cost of primary school building restoration, allowing the project implementers to increase the volume of work
In one primary school receiving the Presidential Instruction (Inpres) Fund in Kabupaten Kupang, DAK funds to the value of Rp108 million that should have only funded the restoration of three classrooms were enough to fund repairs for five rooms
three classrooms, one library, and one teachers' office
If using market prices as a measure, the value of the work reaches Rp400 million, or 270% of the total value of the DAK budget
In line with this, a staff at the Kabupaten Wonogiri Education Office stated that based on empirical experience, the self-managed system has several benefits, such as better building quality, a greater volume of work being completed, economic empowerment translating into an increase in local community income, as well as the empowerment of school committees
Another positive outcome from the self-managed system stems from the significant contributions from students' parents, both in the form of labor and contribution of building materials
In Kabupaten Kupang, all workers only ask for a wage of Rp15,000 per day, lower than the normal rate which can reach Rp25,000–Rp35,000 per day
This is also the case with the procurement of building materials
For example, the market price of teak can reach Rp3.2 million per cubic meter, while students' parents may sell it to the school building committee for Rp1.5 million per cubic meter
It is not really a problem when the government asks the community to contribute to education sector building projects
However, for regions where the majority of the population is poor, such as Kabupaten Kupang and Kabupaten Wonogiri, such requests are inappropriate
One NGO in Kupang stated that requesting poor communities to contribute to education development is ironic
The government should not use the philosophy of education responsibility as a cover-up for their failure to build education infrastructure
From the point of view of poor communities, it is their government that should help them, not the reverse
In this context, the system of self-managed has failed to reach its objective of economically empowering local communities
Another criticism of the self-managed system comes from contractors
They stated that the self-managed method of project works is fundamentally in a breach of Presidential Decree No
80/2003 on the Government Implementation Guidelines for the Procurement of Goods and Services as well as Law No
18/1999 on Construction Services
For example, technically, the quality of self-managed projects is in doubt because the implementers do not possess a certificate of competency as required under Law No
18/1999
If undesired outcomes arise, such as the building collapsing as a result of construction error, no-one can be held responsible
Another criticism is that the self-managed system opens up the high possibility of collusion
This is because not many tradespeople have the appropriate skills to implement building works for public facilities
Principals or school committees award the job to a third party, either an individual or a contractor
One contractor in Kabupaten Kupang stated that in the past, in order to obtain a project, the contractor had to follow the regional government's tender process, while now they only need to go to the principal or the school committee
4.4 Monitoring and Evaluation of DAK Projects 
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities for development projects are still highly inadequate
Especially for DAK projects, among the problems is that both the central government and regional governments do not allocate any budget for M&E activities
FGD participants gave this aspect a relatively low evaluation, as the fourth out of the six aspects of DAK management (see Table 4.1)
In Kabupaten Kupang and Kabupaten Wonogiri, FGD participants gave it the lowest rating (Appendix 5)
FGD participants in Kota Banda Aceh gave M&E activities a fairly high rating
One reason for this is that the Kota Banda Aceh Government has formed the DAK Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Team, consisting of elements from Bappeda, the Finance Division, and the Development Division
The team is assigned to directly monitor DAK project implementation
In addition, as part of the city government internal auditing function, the Kota Banda Aceh Regional Supervision Board (Baswada) also routinely inspects DAK projects
FGD participants were of the opinion that the intensity of M&E activities in the city was quite high as the city is an urban area and so the team can easily visit project locations
While that is the case, Kota Banda Aceh Bappeda stated that M&E activities are still not optimal
The main problem lies with the very low operational funding
In 2006, the city's APBD only provided around Rp8 million for M&E activities for DAK projects, while in 2007, no funds at all have been provided
As a consequence of the lack of provision for a special M&E funding component for DAK projects, M&E activities in the other three sample districts have only been administrative and passive
Each district office tends to wait for reports from the project coordinators or implementers
If in fact they do visit a project, it is usually an incidental visit made in the context of a different activity
The weak and superficial nature of M&E activities for DAK projects may well be connected to the absence of any form of follow-up on such activities
Staff from DAK recipient offices stated that they had not received any feedback from their report to the technical ministry
The Kabupaten Kupang Health Office, for example, routinely sends activities progress report to the Ministry of Finance every three months
However, the region has never received any response or feedback from the central government
As a result, the region is unsure of whether or not their reports have actually reached their intended recipient
According to the legislation, as outlined in Government Regulation No
55/2005 and various technical guidelines from technical ministries, each region must submit quarterly progress reports for their DAK activities to the central government and the regional representative of the central government in the region (provincial governor)
In 2006, the national number of regions that submitted reports that were received by technical ministries was extremely low (see Table 4.2)
less than half of all the regions
In the agriculture sector, the figure was as low as 10%
This shows the level of regional compliance with legislative demands as well as the technical ministries' lack of commitment to monitoring and evaluating the regions' use of DAK
One explanation from a technical ministry on these conditions was the absence of M&E funds
A startlingly low level of DAK reporting was also found in the four sample provinces
In 2005, out of 77 districts/cities, not one had submitted a status report for activities in the road infrastructure subsector
Each deferment in funds disbursement leads to delays in the people receiving any benefit, whereas it is the bureaucrats who have failed to do as required (see also Box 2.1)
4.5 Coordination Coordination is one of the weak points in the management of DAK
This can be seen from the low evaluations it was given by FGD participants, at the fifth of the six phases of DAK management
In Kota Banda Aceh, for example, Bappeda admitted that they are not directly involved in the initial planning stage for DAK-funded programs and activities
Each SKPD using DAK funds devises its own plans and only submits their activities plan to the mayor via the Development Division
After the mayor has signed off on the plans, Bappeda receives the reports
Bappeda, as the leading actor in the executive budget committee, then incorporates the plans into the APBD
This process shows that Bappeda really only has an administrative role in DAK utilization
As such, interagency coordination of DAK budget users is not evident
This lack of coordination results in the ineffective and off-target use of DAK funds
One member of the Kota Banda Aceh DPRD gave the example of a primary school that was recently rehabilitated using the DAK fund and was subsequently torn down because they received a larger amount of funding from a donor/NGO to build the school
In another sample district, Bappeda consistently stated that all the SKPD always coordinate with Bappeda both before and after they receive their allocation of DAK funds
Nevertheless, the FGD participants generally said that the aspect of coordination, both inter-SKPD coordination and coordination with agencies at the provincial level, is weak
Generally, respondents stated that each SKPD is inclined to put forward their own tasks and functions without wanting to see the tasks and functions of other related SKPD
This is in part because each SKPD has to adhere to technical guidelines, so in practice, there is no room to make adjustments according to the joint needs in the region
Particularly relevant to the weak coordination between district/city governments and provincial governments is the case of a primary school that received both DAK and deconcentration funds at the same time
In this case, the district government generally blames the provincial government because they determine project locations “as they please”, without first coordinating with the district government
In Kabupaten Kupang, for example, in 2007, the regional government had selected primary school X as a DAK recipient
However, the provincial government also selected the same school as a recipient of deconcentration funds
One NGO in Kabupaten Gorontalo reported a similar case, where a school received deconcentration funds after already receiving DAK
The staff from Kabupaten Gorontalo Education Office responded that this case occurred because the DAK fund was insufficient to repair all the damage to the particular primary school
V
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS The APBN allocates DAK to fund specific public services provided by district/city governments
The aim is to reduce inequalities in public services between the regions
Although DAK forms part of the APBD, regional governments must conform to various central regulations for its use
In addition, DAK, which is developed for the purpose of assisting regional finance, to some extent has altered to becoming an obstacle in the regional budgeting process
The research on the various regulations found four points with the potential to impede the DAK management
(i) As yet, there is no government regulation that specifically regulates DAK (such as a government regulation on DAK as mandated by Law No
32/2004 Article 162 (4) and Law No
33/2004 Article 42) and the government regulation on the transfer of deconcentration and co-administration funds to DAK (as mandated by Law No
33/2004 Article 108)
(ii) The timetable for the central government's release of allocation decisions and issuance of DAK regulations conflicts with that for APBD preparation
Consequently, apart from regional governments having to make adjustments to their budgets, the project implementation time becomes limited
(iii) Several policies are in dire need of national uniformity but should still allow for variation on some aspects
Conversely, other policies that do not currently allow for any flexibility lead to the ineffective use of funds, and as such require revision in order to provide room for regional, local, or other specific variations, while still retaining some level of national uniformity
(iv) Various laws on organizations and ministerial/institutional tasks with centralistic nuances have not yet been adapted to decentralization law
As a result, DAK management policies are different both between ministries and between regions
The absence of syncronization between DAK, deconcentration, and co-administration funds has made the use of the funds not optimum
These four obstacles lead us to the conclusion that various regulations must be reformed in order to support the proper implementation of decentralization and regional autonomy in general and DAK management specifically
optimalizing efforts to balance the quality and quantity of public services throughout Indonesia
In theory, regulation provides room for regional governments to actively submit proposals for the use of DAK
However, in practice, they have become passive recipients, when actually, they heavily rely on DAK for their regional capital expenditure
To date, regional governments are only asked to send data on the condition of regional infrastructure in various sectors, which the central government uses to determine DAK allocations
The attitudes of regional governments to the central government's handling of DAK allocation indicate a view that the central government is not transparent, to the point where regional officials need to “lobby Jakarta” to obtain a larger DAK allocation
A quantitative analysis of DAK allocation by province indeed shows a low correlation with poor public service infrastructure conditions in the basic education and road infrastructure sectors, and in the health sector, the correlation sign even has an opposite direction with the objectives of DAK
It is evident that coordination and communication surrounding DAK management between agencies at the central level and the regional level, including both provincial and district/city levels, are still limited
In addition, there are still few regional governments that fulfill their obligations to report developments in the use of DAK every 3 months, as mandated by legislation
There are four reasons for this
(i) while the regulations provide sanctions for not reporting, the central government has not applied the sanctions; 
(ii) several regional governments that have submitted reports have not received any response from the central government, and consequently, the regional governments are no longer concerned about their reporting obligations; 
(iii) the sanctions for failing to report would be applied to the region, not the negligent official, and correspondingly, officials do not feel obliged to compile the report; and/or 
(iv) regional governments do not have sufficient capacity to manage public finances
Based on the various findings above, it can be generalized that the management of DAK is centralistic, while the central government does not have the capacity to monitor its use in more than 400 districts and cities
As such, SMERU recommend the following measures
(i) The central government should build a number of new paradigms in the management of DAK by decentralizing it to the provincial governments
coordinate DAK management, and monitor district/city government use of DAK
This authority should be equipped with safeguarding regulations to guarantee the implementation of transparency and participation mechanisms, accountability procedures, and a reward and punishment system
Such a policy would have three benefits
the simplification of DAK management at the central level; the strengthening of governors' authority as representatives of the central government in the regions; and the empowerment of provinces as autonomous regions through fiscal discretion
(ii) Sanctions for failing to submit regional fiscal management reports, including those required for DAK, as set out in Law No
33/2004 Article 102, should not be borne by the region or populace as a whole
Instead, the penalty should be imposed upon bureaucrats, who must share the responsibility for their negligence amongst themselves
DEVELOPMENT DEBATE SERIES
THE CASE OF INDONESIA During the early month of this year, the SMERU Research Institute worked together with LPEM-FEUI and The World Bank Institute to organize a ‘Development Debate Series'
The debate series consisted of two parallel sessions
the Regional Debate and the National Debate about poverty and development
In total, there were 15 meetings
the following report summarizes the key issues discussed during the series
These issues were widespread and varied
The measurement of poverty, and how to broaden this to include dimensions other than consumption-based poverty, featured prominently in the debate series
Structural barriers and low levels of education tend to be factors which hinder poverty reduction policies
At the same time, deregulation and good economic management are both integral to implementing successful poverty alleviation programs
Good governance of public programs and efforts to decrease corruption can also assist poverty reduction programs as well as the general state of the economy
Finally, the greatest challenges for Indonesia will be how to manage the decentralization process and its potential impact on the level of poverty, as well as the methods adopted to institute effective social safety nets that will provide some level of protection for the community
I
Poverty and Its Multi-dimensional Nature There is general agreement in many quarters that poverty is multidimensional
In order to fully understand the nature of poverty, it is not sufficient to simply define poverty as income poverty or consumption poverty
Poverty is not only limited to income and consumption, it is also concerned with health, education, vulnerability to shocks, participation in social and political activities, and many other aspects of life
However, participants in the poverty debate disagree about the extent to which these dimensions can be incorporated into the measurement of poverty
According to one perspective, only those dimensions relevant to poverty reduction policies should be included in the measurement of poverty
Consequently, only those dimensions of poverty which can feasibly measured and empirically assessed are considered to be relevant to poverty reduction policy
However, others argue that the debate should be widened, and are prepared to incorporate as many dimensions of poverty as possible in its definition
They contend that poverty is a very complex social construct and its definition should not be limited by the pragmatics involved in drafting policy
When conducting field studies, many researchers find it very difficult to draw a precise line dividing the poor and the nonpoor
Another argument in favor of considering the wider broad dimensions of poverty is that many factors are indirectly relevant to poverty reduction policie
A good example being the political voice of the community
Theoretically, the voices of all individuals, including the poor, determine who are elected to become members of parliament
Typically, parliaments as an integral part of the process of government, determine the budget allocations and, in theory, the interests of the poor should be represented by this process
However, so far there has been little evidence that the “political voice” and the interests of the poor are adequately represented in many parliaments
II
Structural Poverty Sometimes the source of poverty is deemed to be structural
Hence the term structural poverty
This refers to a situation where poverty occurs or persists because of various community structures
A major assumption behind this concept is that the market is not free to act because the elite always intervenes through economic or political channels
These interventions can be at the local, national or even the multinational level
The following is an example of structural interference in the education and health sectors
A child who is born into a poor family suffering from malnutrition will almost certainly grow up to be a poor adult
The reason is obvious
it is unlikely that such a family will be able to provide an adequate level of nutrition or formal education to help the child escape poverty
Other examples of such structural problems exist in the form of market monopolies, labor repression, gender discrimination, and manipulations of the political environment, which all work against the interests of the poor
III
How to Make the Market Work for the Poor Before the economic crisis, Indonesia's economic policy created many distortions
For example, instead of letting the market respond naturally, the government preferred to “pick winners” by singling out certain industries or enterprises to receive assistance through special facilities
This policy has generally worked against the poor, also making it impossible for small enterprises to compete on a level playing field with those selected by the government
It reduced the competitiveness of the whole economy in export markets as the “winners” most of the time were “domestic players”
Finally, it reduced consumers' purchasing power by ultimately transferring the costs of those special facilities to customers
The economic crisis has put pressure on the Indonesian government to put in place many reforms, including the area of economic policy
Both the central and regional governments have been forced to deregulate many areas of the economy which had become seriously distorted
This has included abolishing the clove trade monopoly, various export levies, inter-regional trade restrictions and quotas, forced sugar cane planting, and quotas on livestock trade
The deregulation process has brought about the reduction of most of the serious distortions in the market
Firstly, the market for agricultural commodities has opened up, increasing the bargaining power of the farmers
Secondly, the diminishing number and impact of both legal and illegal levies have reduced inefficient trade margins
As a result, the “farm gate” price, as a proportion of the market price, has increased significantly
According to one survey, 58% of the farmers interviewed received a price increase of between 1 and 10% since the deregulation process was put into effect while another 33% of farmers received an increase of between 10 and 32%
IV
Human Resources and Education as a Dimension of Poverty In terms of developing human resources through education, Indonesia is facing serious problems in the education sector, particularly at the junior high school level and beyond
At the primary school level, enrolment data indicates that Indonesia has made commendable progress
In 1999, primary school age children between 7 and 12 years of age have an enrolment rate of over 95%
The enrolment rate for children aged 13-15 is 79%, while for children aged between 16 and 18 the rate is only 51%
In terms of developing human resources, the lack of high school education in Indonesia will lead to a less educated workforce in the future
When the data is broken down according to gender, there is no indication that there is serious gender discrimination in terms of access to education in Indonesia
The enrolment rate of boys is only slightly higher than that of girls
However, there is a significant gap in the enrolment rate between children in urban and rural areas
Socio-economic background is a major component of the problems of accessing education in Indonesia
For primary school aged children, the enrolment rate amongst those from families in the richest quintile of per capita expenditure is approximately 99%, while amongst children from families in the poorest quintile the rate is only 92%
The enrolment rate for those of junior high school age in the richest quintile is 93% compared with 66% in the poorest quintile
Worse still, for senior high school aged children enrollment rates
The two enrolment rates are 75% and 29% respectively
This indicates that children from poor families face serious obstacles in accessing and continuing with their education, particularly at those levels beyond primary school
The problem generated by low enrolment levels in junior high school has been the large discrepancy between the number of primary school graduates and the number of places available for enrolment at higher levels of education
Between 1973 and 1978, the Indonesian government established more than 60,000 primary schools throughout the country
As a result, access to primary school increased but unfortunately, there was never a similar school construction program for junior and senior high schools
This raises the question of whether access to education beyond primary school, particularly for the poor, should be the responsibility of the state or left in the hands of private institutions
Traditionally in Indonesia, the role of private institutions becomes more significant at higher levels of education
The Indonesian constitution states explicitly that the welfare of the poor, including their access to education, is the responsibility of the state
However, there are significant financial constraints for the state in carrying out this responsibility, particularly during the present crisis
Furthermore, this constitutional stipulation should not be interpreted as a limitation on the participation of private institutions and the wider community in providing access to education for the poor
However the problems that arise are twofold
Firstly, how can the participation of private institutions in the education sector be improved
Secondly, how can we ensure that the quality of education provided for the poorer section of the community is comparable to that which is available to the general public
From a long-term perspective, education is one of the most effective tools for eradicating poverty
Through better quality and higher levels of education, children from poor families can access better job opportunities, enabling them to break the cycle of poverty
The fact that many children from poor families are unable to continue their education beyond the primary school level constitutes a serious challenge to the eradication of poverty in the future
V
Good Governance, Corruption, and Poverty There is a widespread consensus that poverty eradication requires effective government policies which focus on this issue
In Indonesia, there is evidence that reducing poverty has so far not been successful due to the ineffectiveness of government policy
Hence, em-powering the poor is one of the most important ways to help reduce poverty
Empowerment can be achieved in many ways, but one of the more important methods is through good governance
Corruption reduces economic growth and consequently, inhibits poverty reduction
Thus, better governance will help to reduce corruption
In addition, corruption renders government programs ineffective and undermines their credibility
Meaning that government interventions intended to help the poor are bound to fail
There was general agreement during the debate that corruption negatively impacts upon the poor, yet at the same time, there was disagreement about the best way overcome this problem
Many agree that the low level of civil service salaries is one important factor contributing to rampant corruption in countries like Indonesia
Therefore, improving civil service salaries is just one of the necessary steps in eliminating corruption
Improving civil service salaries, however, has financial consequences
Not only does government spending need to be increased to achieve this, but a source of funding for this increase also needs to be found
One obvious answer is to increase taxation revenue
Currently, Indonesia has a ratio of 11% between tax collection and GDP, which is quite low compared with international standards
Hence, there is still significant scope to increase tax collection in this country
VI
Security
Social Protection Since the beginning of the crisis in 1997, Indonesia has been experiencing a negative net private capital flow
This means that the outflow of capital has been larger than the inflow
The result has been a negative impact on economic growth
At the same time, Indonesia is experiencing a high level of growth in the supply of labor
In order to be able even to absorb these new entrants into the labor market, Indonesia needs to sustain an annual level of economic growth of around 6-7%
Hence, there is a clear need for Indonesia to be able to reverse the negative flow of capital to encourage economic growth, and in particular, it needs to encourage an increase in foreign direct investment (FDI)
During the crisis, the poverty rate in Indonesia increased significantly
According to one method of calculation, it increased from 11.3% in 1996 to 20.3% in 1999, while applying a different method it jumped from 19.2% to 27.4%
Another study shows that Indonesia has 12% of its population categorized as living in chronic poverty and 22% in transient poverty
This indicates that Indonesia has a large proportion of the population who are vulnerable to poverty
However, the Indonesian community has a variety of mechanisms to cope with economic shocks
These coping mechanisms include the following
reducing expenditure on clothing, reducing recreational spending, reducing the quality of food, reducing transport expenses, relying on self-produced food, reducing the quantity of food consumed, borrowing money, selling assets, withdrawing savings, and pawning assets
The government has instituted programs to help the poor cope with the crisis
These public programs include food for work, food subsidies, energy subsidies, a supplementary feeding program, employment generation, employment retraining programs, a health assistance package, and an education subsidy program
In extending social security to the whole population, there are several problems for Indonesia
Firstly, around half of the labor force is employed in the informal sector
Secondly, there is no unemployment insurance to protect the unemployed
Finally, there is no health scheme that covers the elderly
it is unlikely to be resolved in the near future
VII
Decentralization and Its Effect on Poverty This year Indonesia has embarked on a major decentralization initiative
It is expected that this will have an important impact upon the level of poverty throughout the archipelago
The poverty rate and the inequality index in Indonesia vary widely across provinces, as well as between urban and rural areas
Urban areas have a lower poverty rate but a higher level of inequality than rural areas
In terms of urban areas within the provinces, Riau has the lowest rate of poverty and NTT the highest poverty rate, while Maluku has the lowest level of inequality and Yogyakarta has the highest inequality
Within rural areas across provinces, Riau also has the lowest poverty rate and Irian Jaya has the highest poverty rate, while Riau has the lowest inequality and Irian Jaya has the highest inequality
Overall, Riau has the lowest poverty rate and Irian Jaya has the highest poverty rate, while Riau has the lowest level of inequality and Irian Jaya has the highest inequality
This is intriguing as Riau and Irian Jaya are both resource-rich provinces
Curiously, there seems to be no relationship between the poverty rate or inequality and human development
In terms of the human development index, Jakarta is ranked as the top province, while NTB is ranked as least developed province
Poverty reduction programs are usually financed by the development budget
Before decentralization, the provincial budget allocation from the development budget was quite substantial
The highest proportion was in East Java where at the time, 42% of the provincial budget was allocated for development purposes, while the lowest ratio was Jakarta with 15%
Since decentralization began, the provincial governments have received funds from the central government that will basically only cover routine budgetary expenses
On top of that, the provinces will also receive special allocations of revenue, based on their share of the revenue raised from trade in natural resources
However, only two provinces will receive amounts greater than Rp2 trillion, while a other few provinces will receive approximately Rp1 trillion
In fact, however, most will receive below Rp100 billion from these special allocations
As a result, there will be much smaller allocations of funding available for the development budget, and consequently there will be fewer resources available for poverty reduction programs
Alternatively, the regional governments will have to raise their own revenue to finance development expenditure, including poverty reduction programs
Decentralization will also have serious implications for the design and implementation of poverty reduction programs
Before decentralization, all such programs and their implementation guidelines were drafted by the central government
Under decentralization, the regional governments will take over this role, with a pivotal role for lower levels of government down to the village level
At the same time, the central government will establish the definitions and standards so that national level data can still be aggregated
The extent to which decentralization will ultimately effect the plight of the poor in Indonesia is still uncertain
The Determinants of Student Performance in Indonesian Public Primary Schools
the Role of Teachers and Schools
ABSTRACT 
In this paper we investigate the determinants of student performance in mathematics and dictation tests among fourth-grade school children in Indonesia
We use a unique dataset of school and student information that was collected in a nationally representative survey of 110 public schools in 8 Indonesian provinces in 2003
Using an OLS regression technique that compensates for heteroskedasticity, we conduct separate sets of student-level regressions for three performance variables
math scores, dictation scores and combined scores
We found that student performance is strongly influenced by individual variables, teacher variables and school variables
Among the significant variables are the education level of parents; student-teacher ratio; quality of school facilities and teacher absence rate
We also discuss the policy implications of the results
Key words
absenteeism; primary school; achievement
I
INTRODUCTION Over recent decades there has been a massive effort by developing countries, sometimes with assistance from international aid agencies, to put their children in school
Educational attainment, especially primary education, is perceived as one of the main vehicles to improve living standards in developing countries and to spur on nation-wide economic growth
Given the vast resources invested in education, understanding what factors and investments most efficiently improve student learning is of crucial importance
This paper takes a first step toward that goal in the case of Indonesia
Surprisingly, given Indonesia's size and importance, few studies have investigated the determinants of student achievement
In this paper, we use a new unique nationally representative dataset that includes not only student performance data, from math and dictation tests that we administered, but also data on the students' teachers and schools
The results are cross-sectional and hence cannot easily be used to establish causal relationships, but they do highlight some potentially important correlations between performance and the factors that may be amenable to policy interventions
A
Measuring the Quality of Education After achieving success in universal primary education, the next logical step would be to evaluate other aspects of schooling, particularly the quality of schools and teaching
One way of determining the quality of teaching in schools is by looking at the intermediate outcome of student performance (Sanders, 1999)
There are several ways to evaluate a student's “quality” attributable to formal education, but the most tractable indicator is how he or she performs in tests (World Bank, 2003)
There are, howevers, important caveats to using testing as a measure the quality of schooling
students' “output quality” depends very much on their input quality
Strong performance may simply reflect the student's innate ability or prior preparation, rather than the school's contribution
So in other words, gauging the quality of schools depends on measuring how much learning value is added to a student who enrolls in a particular school
In order to establish how much value is added, we need data on student performance prior to entering a particular school or grade
But in this study, we lack baseline pre-enrollment test scores
We do include some variables that are likely to capture some aspects of student preparation or ability, but with this cross-sectional data, our primary focus will be on establishing correlations to assist in understanding student performance in Indonesia
As we do so, we should keep in mind our underlying interest in value-adding
As mentioned above, there is an absolute advantage of using tests as an indicator of school quality, because it is an objective indicator
This is especially true in governmentadministered tests at a national level, because schools or teachers cannot give a student high or low marks based on personal preferences or for other purposes such as securing extra funding or increasing school prestige
Test results are also highly reliable, because each student will get the result that corresponds to his or her abilities, especially abilities that are taught and trained in formal educational institutions
Moreover, national standardized tests enable the government to objectively evaluate one school's level of quality relative to other schools in other provinces around the country
There are, however, also disadvantages with using tests as an evaluation tool
teachers may be tempted to teach to the test and ignore subjects that are not tested (World Bank, 2003)
This is especially true if the test dates and materials are already known in advance
Moreover, there can still be attempts to manipulate results
Thirdly, student-specific skills such as family background and socioeconomic conditions, access to facilities and inherent skills are perceived and have been proven in some studies to have significant roles in determining a student's performance in tests
B
Background on Education Policy in Indonesia Indonesia has two kinds of public primary schools
The first is called Madrasah Ibtidaiyah Negeri (MIN)
MIN schools are overseen by the Ministry of Religious Affairs and use a curriculum designed by the department that is based on Islam; in other words, MI schools are religious schools
The second category of schools are non-MI schools, or regular public schools, to avoid any confusion due to diverse names given to these schools
Two of the more popular names for regular public schools are SDN (Sekolah Dasar Negeri or Public Primary Schools) and SD Inpres (SD Instruksi Presiden or Presidential Instruction Primary Schools)
Regular schools are supervised by the Ministry of National Education, and they use a more secular curriculum; religion is only one of the courses, rather than serving as the curriculum's foundation
In addition to these two categories of public schools, Indonesia also has private primary schools, known as SDS (Sekolah Dasar Swasta) and MIS (Madrasah Ibtidaiyah Swasta)
In January 2001 the government enacted a major regional autonomy law, which has had a substantial impact on the education sector
From an organizational standpoint, since 2001, regular public schools have been controlled and supervised by district governments, although they are still using the curriculum designed by the Ministry of National Education at the national level
By contrast, the religious (MI) public schools are still under the same organizational structure as prior to 2001
Moreover, education decentralization means that school management has been handed down directly to the schools themselves, officially called Manajemen Berbasis Sekolah (School-based Management)
This means individual schools have the authority to manage the available facilities, manage human resources affairs and involve stakeholders in the delivery of education
This new initiative is supported by two new independent institutions
Dewan Pendidikan (Education Boards), which operate at the kabupaten/kota level, and Komite Sekolah (School Committees), which conduct activities at the school level
By developing-country standards, basic education is widespread in Indonesia
In 1984 the government implemented a 6-year Compulsory Education program for the first time, which proved highly successful
by 1988, 99.6% of children were either enrolled in primary schools or had finished the six years of compulsory education (Government of Indonesia, 1997/1998)
In 1994, the Compulsory Education program was renamed the Basic Education Program and was extended into a 9-year program, which requires students to remain in school until they graduate from junior high school (or grade 9)
The target had been to put everybody aged 6 to 15 in school by 1998
But the economic crisis of 1997 led the government to shift the target date to 2008
Then in 2000 the government ratified UNESCO's Education for All 2015 program that was signed in Dakar, which commits Indonesia to reduce adult illiteracy by 5% and provide basic education for all children by 2015 (Sudjarwo, 2003)
In 2003, the Indonesian House of Representatives (DPR) passed a new National Education System law, replacing legislation that had taken effect in 1989
C
Purpose of Study Between late 2002 and early 2003, there were heated discussions on the National Education System law as it was being debated in parliament
One of the more popular topics was the poor performance of Indonesian students
What was missing from these arguments was 
the evidence to support claims regarding the lack of quality among students, especially quantitative evidence; the proof of whether a link exists between student quality and teaching quality in Indonesia, as has been proven in other countries; and, if the link does exist, what kind of influence teaching quality has on student quality
This paper explores the determinants of performance in tests of Indonesian fourthgrade students in public schools in detail, and gauges how decisive factors like teacher quality and school facilities are in determining test results, compared to studentspecific factors such as parents' level of education
Since this paper only aims to provide a basic explanation of the determinants of student performance, the best this paper can do is explain whether student performance is a good indicator of the quality of a school and teaching and, if teacher quality and school facilities are significant, what policy measures can be taken by stakeholders to improve student performance
It should be stressed that while it tries to identify the major correlates of student performance, this paper does not pass judgment on whether quality of schools and teaching in Indonesia is “acceptable”, relative to potential or to international standards
Also, since the data were collected through a survey conducted in 2003 and no studies using similar instruments were conducted before 2001, this study cannot conclude whether the quality of education has changed, for better or for worse, due to decentralization
Another contribution of this analysis is that in addition to the usual explanatory variables, we include the teacher absence rate
Only a handful of recent studies regarding teacher absenteeism have tried to include teacher absence as an explanatory variable, because until recently good data on absenteeism was unavailable
This variable may provide us with valuable insight regarding the determination of student performance
Other than this paper, we only found one recent paper on this topic
Mohandas (2000), which discusses performance in junior secondary schools, in addition to an older paper (Johnstone & Jiyono, 1983)
Thus, this is the first paper to our knowledge in at least two decades that provides the correlates of student performance in primary schools in Indonesia
The rest of the paper is organized as follows
Chapter II discusses the survey where data was collected
Chapter III provides a literature review of determining student achievement
Chapter IV explains the model used for this investigation and data summary
Chapter V discusses the results
Chapter VI provides conclusions and policy implications

DATA 
The data for this study were collected through a health and education provider survey conducted by the World Bank in cooperation with SMERU Research Institute
The main objective of the survey was to collect data on the condition of primary schools and public health centers
The survey was part of a multicountry survey that also included Bangladesh, Ecuador, India, Peru, and Uganda
The survey had three objectives
to document every health and education providerrelated issue; to gain an understanding of the differences in the characteristics between districts as well as between primary schools and public health centers; and to allow assessments of the differences in quality and quantity of service delivery across countries, with the focus on the impact of regional autonomy, public participation, labor policies and income
Data collection in Indonesia took place during two separate rounds, in October 2002 and February 2003
Each school was visited twice to improve the accuracy of the estimates on variables (such as teacher absence), as well as to gauge the similarity of the responses from the two visits
Thus giving us a better understanding of the nature of the existing problems
In Indonesia, as in the other countries in the study, the sample was a stratified, clustered, nationally representative random sample
The Indonesia data were collected from eight provinces chosen randomly
Banten, West Java, Central Java, East Java, Bengkulu, Riau, West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) and Southern Sulawesi
After stratification of the country into four regions, a total of 10 districts were chosen randomly on a probability-proportionate-to-population basis
five urban districts (Cilegon, Bandung, Surakarta, Pasuruan and Pekanbaru) and five rural districts (Gowa, Lombok Tengah, Rejang Lebong, Magelang and Tuban)
In each district, 10 villages were chosen at random, and in the chosen villages up to three primary schools were surveyed at random with at least one private and one public school being included
For public health centers, 10 were chosen at random from each district
The questionnaire in the survey aimed to obtain information at three levels
the facility level, individual level and national level
The facility level included the size of the facility; number of employees; operating hours; employees' activities when visited by the enumerators; types of services available (for public health centers); remoteness; public participation; average education level of the patients and students' parents; supervision; financial condition; employees' education background and the availability of supporting facilities
At the individual level, the survey covered means of transportation used by the employees to get to the facilities; the relationship between the employee and the surrounding area; employees' rank in the facilities; demographic characteristics; mother tongue and ethnic background; work-related education; marital status and number of children; other sources of income; work experience; salary payment method; his or her motivation for choosing a particular occupation and their level of satisfaction
Lastly, at the national level the questionnaire included the different positions in the facility, number of employees and qualifications; tolerated absenteeism level among employees; policies regarding appointment, placement and transfer of employees; employees' participation in facility management; private sector service and condition of private facilities; reward and sanction systems; stakeholder participation in policies and employees' union
The student-performance data used for this paper were collected during the second visit to each school in February 2003
Enumerators administered a brief interview and test to a randomly selected sample of 10 students from the fourth grade in 110 public schools
Almost all schools had only one fourth-grade cohort
Although there might be warranted suspicion that the students did not take the tests seriously due to their irrelevance for the students' grades in school, the enumerators reported and documented that the students seemed to take the tests very seriously
The test instruments are in Appendix 5
This analysis only includes government schools (SDN and MIN), in part because most primary schools across the country are government-run, so students in government-run schools can serve as the best proxy for the country
Moreover, government-run schools generally have similar organizational structures and are subject to a strict standardized national curriculum
These commonalities may make it easier to distinguish the effects on performance of differences in school management and family background factors
More explanation regarding the data is available in section IV.2 and IV.3

LITERATURE REVIEW 
Many studies have related student performance to various aspects of education such as the quality of a school, quality of teaching, teacher remuneration, class size and student gender, to mention several widely used factors
The main problem in relating these aspects is that the non-measurable outputs may be as important as the measurable ones
There are also some concerns about the fact that students are taught by more than one teacher, making it difficult to link the performance of a particular student to a particular teacher (Kingdon & Teal, 2002)
A study on schools in India investigated the relationship between performancerelated pay and student achievement (Kingdon & Teal, 2002), addressing the important issue of endogeneity in the relationship between pay and achievement
In the study, the writers discussed two issues
an earnings function for teacher's pay and a production function for student achievement
The authors found strong evidence that performance-related pay in the private sector impacts on student achievement, but no evidence of a similar cause-effect relationship in public schools
A study in OECD countries on the role of deviations in students' characteristics to their performance showed that students whose parents (especially mothers) have high school certificates or higher qualifications perform better than their peers (OECD, 2001)
Family affluence is also a very decisive factor, although students in less affluent families in some OECD countries perform better than the OECD average (OECD, 2001)
The study itself discussed many other differences in student characteristics and background that may contribute to differences in student performance such as gender, family socioeconomic status, culture, language spoken at home and family structure
Another comparative study on public schools among states in the United States found that in Tennessee, smaller class sizes contribute positively to student learning, particularly in fields like elementary reading (Darling-Hammond, 2000)
The studies on class size are not limited to public schools, as another study found that there is a consistent negative relationship between student-teacher ratio and the average examination results in UK private schools (Graddy & Stevens, 2003)
A study in secondary schools in Bangladesh however, (Asadullah, 2002) found an insignificant positive sign on the class size variable in determining student achievements using both OLS and IV regressions
The author concluded by suggesting that a reduction in class size is not useful in a developing country like Bangladesh
Moreover, other studies on class sizes found that small class sizes are either not significant or even detrimental to student performance (Hanushek, 1995; Angrist & Lavy, 1999; Urquiola, 2001; and Hoxby, 2000a)
In addition, a review of 277 econometric studies further emphasized the inconsistency of the effect of class size on achievement when it stated that 28% of the studies report statistically significant estimates but 13% of those report a statistically significant negative sign (Jones, 2001)
Other studies stated that teachers are the most important influence on student progress, even more important than socioeconomic status and school location (Archer, 1999 and Armentano, 2003) that found that teacher qualifications are more important than class size
One study (Darling-Hammond, 2000) concluded that measures of teacher preparation and certification are by far the strongest correlates of student achievement in reading and mathematics
Another important and generally consistent finding is that girls usually perform better than boys
This result is true for developing countries like Malawi (UNICEF, 2003), where UNICEF interviewed teachers regarding performance of female students, and more developed countries like Australia and New Zealand (Buckingham, 1999 and 2003)
According to the study in Australia, this is related to the fact that boys' performance has been declining over the past decade while girls' performance has improved
Australian girls are now 11% more likely than boys to complete grade 12, and in the 1998 New South Wales HSC the average mark for girls was higher than boys in 64 out of 70 subjects
Moreover, boys' scores tend to be clustered at the top and the bottom while girls' are closer to the middle
Another statistical investigation by the same author (Buckingham, 2003) offered some explanations by mentioning that there is a diminishing presence of men in boys' daily lives; and the fact that there has been a ‘feminization' of schools in Australia for the past two decades, which means that curriculum and assessments now suit girls more than boys
There are also several studies that discussed peer effects on student achievement
The results indicate that peer achievements have a positive effect on achievement growth
On the other hand, the variance in their achievements appears to have no effect (Hanushek et al., 2001)
Another study (Hoxby, 2000b) that used two methods in looking at the effects of peers with different gender and racial groups in Texan primary schools also found that that both male and female test scores in math and reading improve by increasing the share of females in a class
On the other hand, the effects of an increase in a racial group in a class are not as convincing as gender with only one or two race groups being significant, and peers in the same racial group experience the effects highest
Moreover, this study also found that racial origin of peer achievement is not important
Except within the same racial groups
As we already mentioned, we found only one recent paper on this topic that was written using Indonesian data
Mohandas (2000) used the result of 1997 TIMSS (Third International Mathematics and Science Study) instruments in measuring the mathematics and science achievements of junior secondary students
The paper found that the sex (boys constantly outperformed girls), age and background of students were significant student-level determinants of achievement
The other paper (Johnstone & Jiyono, 1983), which tested student achievement in language and mathematics in rural and semiurban Yogyakarta, found that background is more important than students' individual characteristics and attitudes towards school, and family encouragement is more important than family wealth or socioeconomic conditions
Furthermore, out-of-school factors were found to affect language scores most and math scores least 
Which means teacher absence should have a greater effect on mathematics than language aptitude
IV
THE MODEL AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS A
The Model 
The model for student performance adopted in this study follows a common firm production function, which was also used by Kingdon & Teal (2002)
Appendix 1 documents the description of the variables
where Sij is the score in math and dictation tests of the ith student in the jth school, and it is determined by Gij, the sex of a student; 
QP ij, a matrix of the characteristics of a student's parents; 
QT j, a matrix of the teacher's characteristics in the jth school; 
QS j, a matrix of the quality of the jth school; 
and FS j, any fees received by the jth school from both the government and the parents; while uij is the error term in the model
District variables are added into the model to serve as an indicator of whether there are fundamental differences among districts
Sij consists of three types of scores - math, dictation and a combination of both - and they will be estimated individually
The tests, which consisted of the same set of questions for each student, were administered by our enumerators
The first figure is SCOREMATH, which is the raw score from the math test that consisted of thirteen basic problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
The second figure is SCOREWORD, which is the raw score from the dictation test
The third one is PERFORMANCE, which is simply the average of the SCOREMATH and SCOREWORD for each student
QP ij is made up of a student's mother's and father's highest level of educational attainment dummy variables, whether the student takes extracurricular courses or lessons, and whether the parents have met the teacher in the past six months
Public school teachers are supposed to meet with parents at least once every four months, but meetings can occur more frequently if the parents and teachers are active attendants of school committee (BP3) and other similar meetings
On the other hand, there are parents who do not see their children's teachers for years or, in some extreme cases, ever
The purpose of meetings is to maintain communication and exchange information that can be beneficial to student performance
QT j is the teachers' characteristics
ABS_RATE_TOTAL, is the teacher absence rate; 
AVG_EXPERIENCE and AVG_EXPERIENCE_SQ are the average years of experience of teachers in the school and the average years of experience squared; 
PROP_PERM_TEACHER is the proportion of permanent teachers in the school which, in public schools, usually means civil servants; 
PROP_TEACHER_OTHJOBS is the proportion of teachers who have other occupations; 
PROP_FEMALE_TEACHER is the proportion of female teachers; 
PROP_TEACHER_DISS is the proportion of teachers who are dissatisfied with their salary; 
PROP_TEACHER_ABOVE_SPG is the proportion of teachers who have teacher training beyond secondary high school
In Indonesia, teacher training starts at secondary high school, or Teacher Training Schools (SPGs)
People who wish to become teachers go to SPGs instead of regular high schools
Teachers who are trained only at SPGs are only licensed to teach in elementary schools
Although government regulations require teachers to have at least attended SPGs, in some parts of the country this regulation is waived due to teacher shortages
QS j is the condition and characteristics of the school
MAIN_LANG_INDO indicates whether the official school language is Indonesian; 
MAIN_LANG_DIFF indicates whether the official school language is different from the mother tongue of the majority of students; 
AVG_CLASS_SIZE is the average size of the classes where the test was administered (in this case fourth grade); 
STUDENT_PER_TEACHER is the studentteacher ratio in the school and STUDENT_PER_TEACHER_SQ its square (so it is not only for the fourth grade); 
LIBRARY_AVAIL indicates whether there is a functional library at the school; binomial variables to indicate whether the school has the following infrastructure
paved road, toilets, electricity, a playground, maps and charts, and a staff room; TEACHER_MEET, which is also a binomial variable to indicate whether there has been a staff meeting in the past 6 months
FS j is the fees related to the school
It has three variables
AMOUNT_RECEIVED, which is the amount of government funds received by the school in the 2001/2002 school year, measured in millions of rupiah; TOTAL_FEES, which consists of exam fees and other fees charged to each student, normalized to monthly average in thousands of rupiah; and MONTHLY_BP_FEE, which is some form of compulsory membership fee for parents to take part in the BP3, which is comprised of parents and teachers, and its duty is to oversee school activities
The BP3 fee is normalized to a monthly average in thousands of rupiah
In theory, one might expect any effects of transfers and fees to be mediated by the teacher and school quality variables, if the fees affect student performance primarily by allowing purchase of better inputs into the educational process
We include fees however, because some dimensions of quality are without doubt unobservable or at least immeasurable, and fees seem likely to correlate with these dimensions and therefore with student performance
Furthermore, including the three sources of funds separately may provide a test of which type of accountability is most effective in inducing strong performance by the school - accountability to government agencies, to individual “clients”, or to school organizations
B
The Possibilities of Bias Other studies have documented potential bias-generating issues in this kind of investigation
One potential bias stems from the potential correlation of student performance with unobservables
One such unobservable is the student's ability to learn or educability
This variable is difficult to measure accurately, even if some sort of aptitude test is available (it is not in our data)
But it is certainly an important element in the educational production function
Omitting it will therefore introduce bias if the variable is correlated with other regressors, such as parental education or income (Graddy & Stevens, 2003)
To try to address this problem, we include several variables that are likely to correlate with student educability - parental educational attainment; whether the student takes extracurricular lessons; and parental attention to the student's progress
Various potential sources of endogeneity could bias our econometric results
One such source is parental choice of school for their children
If that choice (or the applicants' choice of school) is correlated with characteristics that are observed by parents or school administrators but not by the econometrician, then the analysis may incorrectly attribute to the school or teachers' performance effects that actually stem from individual characteristics
Kingdon (1996) attempted to control for selectivity of students into private and public schools in India and found that the selectivity term was only weakly significant when there were no controls for any school or teacher variables
It is possible that this result would also hold in the Indonesian context; however, we know of no studies testing this proposition
Endogenous student assignment to classes could similarly be a source of bias, if students are assigned based on unmeasured characteristics correlated with performance
As already mentioned above, however, most schools surveyed only have a single fourth-grade cohort
In any event, our data on teacher characteristics are not class-specific, but are averages for each school
While taking averages will reduce our ability to distinguish teacher effects from noise, it should eliminate this potential source of bias
Another potential source of bias is the possibility that parents enroll their children in extracurricular classes or tutoring - so that the measured public-schooling inputs do not capture all formal educational inputs
The direction of this bias is not easy to predict; poor-performing students may be sent to tutoring to get remedial attention, but it is also possible that high-ability students with motivated parents receive tutoring to compensate for inadequacies in public schooling
In this case, we did collect information on tutoring from the students, which should help to reduce this source of bias
Nevertheless, we recognize that this variable also serves as a proxy for parental income - in that only parents who are relatively affluent can afford to enroll their children in extracurricular classes - and as an indirect measurement of parental attention
So while including this variable seems important, interpreting it will require caution
In summary, in light of the bias issues we have mentioned above and the measures we have taken to accommodate them, we are reasonably confident of the robustness of our results
C
Data Summary of Math Scores In this section, we divide the student test scores into quartiles and look at the characteristics of the schools, students and teachers of each quartile
Appendix 2 documents this exercise for math scores
The highest score in the math test was 100 while the lowest score was 0
The actual length of the math test varied from 5 to 21 minutes, based on the amount of time the students spent finishing the test
Unsurprisingly, and consistent with evidence from other countries, this new evidence from Indonesia shows that the average level of education of fathers increases with the test-score quartiles (from lowest to highest)
In the first quartile, most fathers only have a primary school certificate, while in the fourth quartile most fathers have at least a high school certificate
In addition, the proportion of fathers who have a high school certificate continues to rise in higher quartiles
In the bottom quartile, only 17% of fathers have a high school certificate, while in the top quartile 40% of fathers do
The same pattern is true for mothers
although the majority of mothers in all quartiles completed only primary school, the percentage of mothers who have a high school certificate increased from 10% in the first quartile to 29% in the fourth quartile
Other variables which correlate with performance include gender, infrastructure, source of funds and parental involvement variables
Girls are over represented among high scorers
56% of students in the highest quartile are girls, compared with 45% in the lowest quartile
The proportion of female teaching staff also increases with student performance, from 58% in the first quartile to 65% in the fourth quartile
While some indicators of the quality of school facilities do not vary much across quartiles, others such as the existence of a library and toilets also increase between the first quartile and the fourth quartile
In addition, although the amount of transfers received from the government is relatively equal for all quartiles of students, the schools of higher-quartile students charge higher BP3 and school fees
Finally, more parents of the children who performed better in the math test had met teachers in the two to six months prior to the test
D
Data Summary of Dictation Scores Appendix 3 summarizes the dictation test scores
Those scores range from 0 to 100, while the time that students took to complete the test ranged between 2 and 39 minutes
The findings on (bivariate) correlates of dictation test scores are broadly consistent with the findings for the math test, in terms of trends in the movement between quartiles
The main difference is in government transfers
schools with more children who performed well in the dictation test received significantly more funds
Schools of students in the higher quartiles are also more likely to have electricity
Another finding from the data is that students in higher quartiles attend schools with fewer teachers who have other occupations
The average class size (for fourth-grade classes) and the pupil-teacher ratio (for the school) both show that, in terms of simple correlations, students whose scores are in higher quartiles are in schools that have more students in a class or, other words, more students per teacher
E
Private School Performance Although we focus on public primary schools, it is useful to compare their results with private schools
Our data on private school students consist of 319 students from 35 schools
The comparison between both schools for both tests is in Table 1
On average, students in private schools perform better than their counterparts in public schools, although the only significant difference is in math performance
Furthermore, the mean differences are only slight, less than 3 points on a 0-100 scale
This indicates that there is no significant difference in performance between public and private schools
The limited number of observations however, prevent us from analyzing private schools further
V
RESULTS
To estimate the model, we used OLS regression with the standard errors adjusted for heteroskedasticity using school clusters
The estimations were carried out for each test type
The results of the estimations are provided in Table 2
Estimation using all three test results shows that female students performed significantly better on our test, confirming the unconditional relationship revealed in the quartile comparisons
The education level of fathers, while it has positive coefficients, does not significantly correlate to performance
By contrast, the education level of mothers appears to matter
Students whose mother completed any level of education performed significantly better in math than students with illiterate mothers, and those whose mothers completed high school performed significantly better on the dictation test
This finding is consistent with the existence of a strong inter-generational education link found in many other countries, although there is still controversy on its reasons between education spillover (e.g
Chevalier, 2003) and genetics (e.g
Black et al., 2003)
Several teacher characteristics correlate with performance
First, teacher absence significantly and negatively correlates with student performance on the math test, though not on the dictation test
Remembering that the regressor is the average absence rate for the school, the effect of absence of the child's own teacher would presumably be much larger, although there were not enough observations over time to calculate the absence rate for 4th-grade teachers with any precision
This suggests that the absence of teachers from math-related subjects must be taken seriously
It may also point to a difference in the teacher's role in developing a child's mathematical and language skills
The dictation test only consisted of sentences being dictated, and students have more opportunities to acquire language skills (less so for math skills) outside of school, from parents and others
Because of the lack of data on teacher absence rates in the past, this is one of the first studies to verify empirically a link between teacher absenteeism and student performance
Other teacher variables also emerge as significant correlates
One is teacher experience
the significant quadratic teacher experience term in the math regressions suggests that experience may have an increasing marginal return over at least some range
Another, more ambiguous relationship is with a teacher's contract status
The proportion of permanent teachers in schools is significant in both regressions, but with opposite effects
it negatively correlates with math scores but positively (although weakly) correlates with dictation scores
Hence, the overall correlation of the proportion of permanent teachers with average performance is insignificant
The outside employment of teachers also appears to matter
Attending a school with a higher proportion of teachers with a second job negatively correlates with math performance
The correlation with dictation scores is also negative, but insignificant
One obvious possibility is that this relationship is causal
Teachers who moonlight cannot concentrate fully on teaching and hence do not teach their students as well
Other explanations are also possible, but it is a useful step forward to establish a correlation
Finally, the proportion of female teachers in a school has a negative and significant correlation with math performance
The correlation with dictation performance is insignificant
A simplistic interpretation of our results would be that females make better students but poorer teachers in math-related subjects
But the story is more complex than that
In Appendix 4, we segregate male and female students and run math performance regressions separately for each sub-sample
The results show that the proportion of female teachers does not correlate with the performance of female students but negatively and significantly correlates with male students' performance
We leave the investigation of this phenomenon for future studies
We turn now to school conditions and characteristics
First, the language used in the school was correlated with test performance
Students at schools that use Indonesian as their official language of instruction perform significantly better in all three dependent variables, even with the various controls that we have included
It is not surprising that these students performed better on the dictation test, given that it was conducted in Indonesian, but they also achieved significantly higher math scores
Along the same lines, students attending schools where instruction is in a different language from their mother tongue also received significantly lower scores on the dictation test
Math scores were however, not influenced by this second language variable; presumably because of the universality of numerical symbols
Another set of school variables relates to class size
One such measure that we included is the average fourth-grade class size
This variable has a negative and significant coefficient in the total-score regression (although the effect is insignificant for the separate math and dictation regressions)
some support for the presumption that large classes have detrimental effects on student performance
A second measure is the pupil-teacher ratio for the school, calculated based on the total number of teaching staff (both permanent and contract teachers) and total enrollment reported by the principal
Surprisingly, the pupil-teacher ratio has a positive correlation with math test scores (and overall performance), while its square has a negative correlation
Simple calculations using the point estimates suggest that the student-teacher ratio that is associated with the highest overall performance is 25 - which is slightly higher than the actual average ratio for any of the student-performance quartiles reported in Appendix 2
This result is at odds with the usual assumption that lower pupil-teacher ratios always improve learning outcomes
A third set of school variables measures the accessibility to the school
The accessibility measure included in the regressions is proximity to a paved road, which may serve as a summary measure for the cost of transportation and travel to the school
This variable gives mixed results, for example, students at more accessible (or less remote) schools have higher average math scores, but lower average dictation scores
Fourth, in terms of school facilities, students at schools with at least one functioning toilet performed better on the math test
Interestingly, the effect is significant for girls, but not for boys
This is consistent with evidence from Bangladesh and elsewhere, where it has been argued that availability of toilets is particularly important in increasing the number of girls enrolled and their educational attainment (World Bank, 2001)
The other significant facility variable is the availability of a playground, which is negatively correlated with performance
Since we do not have any data to further investigate the negativity of having a playground, we leave this for future studies
Finally, in terms of school management, students at schools with recent staff meetings received higher scores on both the math and dictation tests
This result is simply suggestive at this point, but one interpretation might be that schools managed more actively by their principals
or, alternatively, those managed in a more participatory way - tend to perform better
Interestingly, none of the finance variables (transfers and fees) yielded significant coefficients
This means that although money is important, it is more important to ensure that it is spent on things that are significant for improving student performance
VI
CONCLUSION 
This paper estimates empirically the determinants of student performance in public schools in Indonesia, using a nationally representative sample of fourth graders
We modeled performance using a common firm production function model, and ran three sets of regressions using three different dependent variables
each student's math score, dictation score, and the combined average score
The data for this study came from a survey of schools in ten districts in eight provinces, selected through stratified clustered random sampling at the national level, which was conducted by the SMERU Research Institute and World Bank in 2002-2003
All three sets of estimations yielded broadly similar results
One interesting finding is that higher teacher absence significantly correlates with poorer student performance in the math test and the average score
Because prior studies lacked access to data on teacher absence in Indonesia, this correlation has not been observed before
While our data does not allow us to establish causality, this result is consistent with the view that teacher absenteeism is either a cause or a symptom of problems related to service delivery in the education sector
A companion paper using this dataset explores in detail the extent and possible causes of teacher absenteeism, with a view to suggesting policies that might reduce the absenteeism rate (Rogers et al., 2004) and increase the quality of schooling
Among student-specific variables, the significant predictors of performance are the child's sex - with girls scoring higher - and the education levels of parents
The positive correlation with parental education is consistent with results from other countries, but still useful in underlining the future spillovers from investment in the human capital of one generation
In general, the teacher and school characteristics variables which correlate with performance met our expectations, such as the negative coefficients of the proportion of teachers who have other occupations, class size, and the different languages at school and at home, and the positive coefficients of functioning toilets
There are however, other interesting results, such as the negative correlation between a student's dictation ability and proportion of permanent teachers and the mixed results on the coefficients of facilities variables like proximity to paved roads and the existence of playgrounds
Another result that should be reiterated is the non-monotonicity of the correlation with pupil-teacher ratio
If we could interpret this result causally, it would suggest that too few students in a class might be as detrimental as too many, and that the optimal ratio is in between
While intriguing, this result clearly requires further exploration
It is possible that the effect of pupil-teacher ratios on performance is actually monotonically negative, but that low ratios are correlated with unmeasured variables that worsen student performance
We have tried to account for such variables here, which include the remoteness of the school, but we cannot guarantee that we have succeeded fully
Another interesting result is the insignificance of the fees variables
This implies that any effect of financial support in improving student performance is mediated entirely by the school and teacher characteristics variables included in the regression
Of course, it makes sense that money should be important if, and only if, it is used to enhance the quantity and quality of schools and teachers; but what is interesting is the relatively small number of regressors that apparently captured these quantity and quality dimensions effectively
By contrast, it is also surprising to see that indicators like the proportion of teachers above SPG is insignificant in all specifications and the proportion of teachers dissatisfied with their salaries is also insignificant
This means that teachers who are dissatisfied with their salaries provide the same level of input to student performance as the satisfied ones
In addition, teachers who have training above the SPG level do not provide any significantly better improvement in student performance than those only of SPG level or below
Our results highlight several policies for raising student achievement that may warrant further investigation
One is improving school facilities, and not just those directly related to pedagogy
Girls at schools with functioning toilets have significantly higher scores, in a result that echoes findings in South Asia linking toilet facilities to the number of girls enrolled and their educational attainment
Second, it is likely that reducing teacher absence would raise student performance
We recognize that poor performance and high absenteeism may both stem from the same underlying factors, such as 
poor school management and unmotivated students, but the effect persists even when we include proxies for those factors
Third, reducing the incidence of teachers' outside employment may improve their students' performance
Fourth, there is no robust evidence, after controlling for absence, that schools with more permanent teachers (as opposed to contract teachers) perform better
This finding might encourage experimentation with greater use of contract teachers, on the condition that their high absenteeism rate is significantly lowered
Finally, the results provide some evidence that pupil-teacher ratios below the current average level are not associated with better performance, ceteris paribus
It is worth exploring further the possibility that educational resources might better be spent elsewhere
This analysis is a first attempt at understanding the degree and sources of variation in student performance in Indonesia, and further work is clearly necessary
First, there are a number of other variables that should be tested for correlation with performance once the data become available
For example, other student-specific variables that seem likely to improve performance include
the student's time allocation (to work and study) outside school (even if this is somewhat endogenous); parental financial or tutoring assistance for students; and the number of siblings and birth order
Second, our data were cross-sectional, it would be ideal to be able to retest the same students and generate a panel dataset, so that we could investigate the correlates of educational value-added
As we have reiterated above, there is still much work to be done before we can obtain an adequate knowledge of how to increase the quality of education in Indonesia
We hope, however, that this paper has made a useful initial contribution
Making Services Work for the Poor in Indonesia
A Report on Health Financing Mechanisms in Kabupaten East Sumba, East Nusa Tenggara
A Case Study
ABSTRACT 
Kabupaten Sumba Timur is one of 29 kabupaten/kota that were included in the test piloting of the JPK-Gakin program
Since 2003, the local health agency (Bapel) has been quite successful in managing this program
The program that is funded by the government from fuel subsidy allocations has already touched the poor whose numbers are quite significant (75% of the population are poor families) in Sumba Timur
Since 2005, the government has appointed PT Askes as the only implementing body for the JPKGakin program, while Bapel still operates this program
The involvement of two managers as JPKGakin implementers made the government issue a policy on the division of the puskesmas service area.
This transition period provided an opportunity for the local government to undertake an evaluation of the implementation of the program
There are several differences in the type and extent of health services offered by the two of them
The outcome of the findings shows that puskesmas and hospitals have responsibility for the patient costs of all poor families
However, the number of referrals of the poor to hospitals is small although Bapel provides transport allowances for patients who are referred to the hospital
There are quite a lot of limitations that are faced by the poor who live in a wide area across Sumba Timur
endemic malaria, minimal numbers of health workers in rural areas and the long distances of peoples' homes from health services
The manager of JPK-Gakin needs to give proper attention to the handling of health in Sumba Timur, the majority of whose people are poor
Key words
JPK-Gakin; Sumba Timur; health; poverty program
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Around 75% of the population in East Sumba is classified as poor
The population of Kabupaten Sumba Timur is 198,940
As many as 129,074 people or 31,214 households were classified as poor in 2003 and this figure rose to 159,037 people or 34,626 households in 2004
In general, the community has low economic, education and health levels
Geographically, people's houses are quite distant from health facilities making it a challenging task for health workers to provide services to local communities
A large number of health workers, both medical workers and paramedics, are still required considering the poor quality of health in the community and the distance between people's homes and health facilities
Of the 17 community healthcare centers (puskesmas) in Kabupaten Sumba Timur, five do not have a doctor
Only one puskesmas (the one in the city) has a dentist
There are also a limited number of paramedics
Many secondary healthcare centers (pustu) do not have a midwife
For example, Puskesmas Nggongi in Kecamatan Karera, which is 150 km from the kabupaten capital, has only one doctor, three midwives, five nurses and four health workers/administrative staff
They serve 10,863 residents spread across ten villages
Three of these villages are located on separate islands, the others are between 3 and 42 km away and public transport is limited
This puskesmas however, also provides in-patient treatment
It has a total of ten beds, all of which are usually taken
Malaria is endemic in East Sumba at most times
It is the second most common disease after acute respiratory tract infection
Puskesmas and hospitals admit adults and children with malaria almost every day
While communities in East Sumba try to treat initial symptoms using traditional medicine (a concoction of herbs), if symptoms persist, they usually seek medical assistance at polindes (village maternity clinics) or puskesmas with a simple laboratory
The number of patients during the wet season is usually higher than that during the dry season, particularly patients with malaria
This is caused by the humid climate and the amount of animal faeces
The poor live in houses with grass-thatched roofs that usually leak during the wet season and thus are more humid
Health cards for the poor are fairly well distributed and are used to obtain medical treatment at puskesmas (including pustu and polindes)
Health cards were used by 16% of patients at puskesmas in 2004, whereas only 0.12% of patients at hospitals used them
While the Executive Body (Bapel) provides transport allowances of up to Rp25,000 for short distances and Rp300,000 for long distances for patients referred to hospitals, communities still have doubts about following up treatment at hospitals
This is due to extremely poor households not being able to pay for the transport and food costs of the family member who accompanies the sick individual to hospital
Poverty and the distance between a house and the hospital are obstacles for communities referring families to hospitals
Health insurance for the poor has been available since 2003
Initially, it was managed by Bapel which was established by the East Sumba regional government
At present (2005), the program providing health insurance for the poor (JPK-Gakin) is not only managed by Bapel, but also PT Askes
According to the Health Minister's Decree No
1241/MENKES/SK/XI/2004, PT Askes was to be entrusted with managing the JPK-Gakin insurance program across Indonesia as of 1 January 2005, however the role of Bapel, which has managed the funds so far, has not been eliminated
Funds from the Regional Budget (APBD) that have to date been used in addition to the funds previously used for the fuel subsidy (PKPS BBM), are still being managed by Bapel which covers around 12 puskesmas
On the other hand, PT Askes manages the (national) PKPS BBM funds that cover the health needs of up to 81,200 poor people living in five puskemas areas
The determination of a puskesmas service area was based upon distance (the distance from a hospital)
The regional government decided that PT Askes would manage patients referred from puskesmas to hospitals that were quite close, whereas the remainder would be managed by Bapel
PT Askes' policy, that does not cover transport costs for patients referred by puskesmas to hospitals, resulted in the five puskesmas relatively close to the city being chosen
Because Bapel covers transport costs for referral patients, the 12 puskesmas that are relatively further away are still managed by them
There are several differences in the health benefits offered by Bapel and PT Askes
Firstly, PT Askes' standard reimbursement for maternity services provided by midwives in villages is much higher than that of Bapel
Secondly, hospitals regard PT Askes' standard price of medication to be too low and, thirdly, Bapel covers transport costs for patients referred to hospitals, whereas PT Askes does not
There is concern that these differences will give rise to envy between health providers and make their work more difficult
Hospitals are being forced to organize two administrative systems and employ two staff members, whereas previously only one person handled these matters
The involvement of two insurers in this insurance program is a part of the transition period, and over the first year the regional government will evaluate the effectiveness of the two insurers
After that, the regional government will select the insurer preferred by the public and health providers (puskesmas and hospitals)
Another possibility is that the regional government will continue to use both Bapel and PT Askes simultaneously, although the system will be adapted to ensure uniformity
The evaluation will be based upon the experiences of a number of parties, such as hospitals, puskesmas, the Health Office and the community
Meanwhile, PT Askes hopes that the regional government and its supporting bodies will cooperate because it is unable to work without the supporting data and information from the relevant government offices
To date, the regional government, including the Health Office, has supported the health insurance program for the poor, regardless of who manages it, so that residents of East Sumba – specifically the poor – can obtain adequate health services that meet their needs
I
INTRODUCTION GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE REGION 
Kabupaten Sumba Timur is one of 29 kabupaten/kota included in the trial of a health insurance program for the poor
The program, which began in 2003, is a national program administered using the funds previously used for the fuel subsidy (PKPS-BBM BIDKES)
Between 1998 and 1999, the central government established the Community Health Insurance Program that took the form of Social Safety Net assistance packages in the Health Sector (JPS-BK)
This program was almost the same as the health insurance for the poor included in the JPK-Gakin program, however, it was not without flaws
Using the funds previously used for the fuel subsidy, the performance of the health insurance program for the poor was improved in 2003
Kabupaten Sumba Timur was selected as one region for the evaluation of the JPK-Gakin program because it is a region with a large percentage of poor people (75% of the population in East Sumba is poor)
In addition to this, the hilly terrain and distances between houses influence how effectively the program is utilized in this region
Kabupaten Sumba Timur is located in East Nusa Tenggara
It has an area of 7,005km2 and is divided into 15 kecamatan, comprising 16 kelurahan and 126 villages
Based on data from Statistics Indonesia, there were 198,940 people or 37,273 households in this kabupaten in 2004 with a fairly low population density of 27 people/km.2 The kabupaten is located in a mountainous area made of limestone
It is infertile and dry 
thus it is difficult to obtain clean water
A large portion of the population earns their living from working as seasonal farmers and fishermen as well as cattle, buffalo, horse, pig and goat farmers
Their economy is classified as small
There are two hospitals (one private and one public), 17 puskesmas complete with cars to act as mobile health clinics, 60 pustu, 82 polindes, 391 integrated community healthcare centers (posyandu), three pharmacies and seven medical practices (including Waingapu – the kabupaten capital)
II
THE HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEME A
COMMENCEMENT 
The JPK-Gakin program began in August 2003 with the formation of the Executive Body (Bapel)
Before this, preparations such as human resource development for the individuals who would be involved in the program took place over one year
The East Sumba regional government obtained assistance from GTZ and advice from Professor Ali Gufron from Gadjah Mada University in the form of technical guidance (training relating to the administration of funds and institutional management, and analyzing the criteria used to determine poor households)
Apart from that, guidance also took the form of determining appropriate tariffs, premiums and unit costs for puskesmas and hospitals
Several staff from the Health Office also had the opportunity to study participatory management at Gadjah Mada University
The preparation phase did not just involve stakeholders such as the Health Office, Bapel, public and private hospitals as well as puskesmas, but almost all institutions in the regional government and Commission C and E (health sector commissions) of the local assembly (DPRD), which met several times to coordinate the program
This shows that the East Sumba regional government, particularly the bupati, is fairly interested in health services for the community
Other than the Malaria Eradication Program that was operating beforehand, this program is considered to be the regional government's “Leading Program”
B
THE INSURERS 
Since 2003, the JPK-Gakin program in East Sumba has been managed by Bapel, which consists of six staff
four civil servants from the Health Office and two workers who are paid an honorarium
Currently, management of the JPK-Gakin program in East Sumba is going through a transition period
As a result of the Health Minister's decree in 2004 on the assigning of PT Askes to manage the healthcare program for the poor, PT Askes has also managed the JPK-Gakin program since 1 January 2005
Thus, Bapel and PT Askes have been managing the JPK-Gakin program at the same time, albeit in different regions
In accordance with the Health Minister's decree, PT Askes only manages health insurance for 81,200 poor people, covering five of the 17 puskesmas in Kabupaten Sumba Timur
The remainder, that is the poor in the other 12 puskesmas areas, is still managed by Bapel
PT Askes is a health insurance agency established by the Ministry of Health
All decisions regarding this agency are made by the ministry
Similarly, all insurance policies offered by PT Askes in East Sumba, the number of poor households covered as well as benefits, are determined by the ministry
Given the organization of this agency, PT Askes in the regions does not have the freedom to adapt services to the needs of the local community
Based upon a joint agreement between the Ministry of Health, PT Askes and the Ministry of Trade, insurance tariffs for the poor in hospitals in East Sumba are included in Group D, with the tariff reaching Rp63,000 per person per day
Funds from the central government (PKPS BBM) are transferred to PT Askes, which then uses them for
basic health services at puskesmas and the centers included in their network, such as health services provided by village midwives (examination of pregnant women, as well as assistance during labour and neo-natal care); 
in-patient services at puskesmas; 
referrals to hospitals; and 
recording and provision of medication at puskesmas and the centers included in their network
Funds provided by the regional government are channeled through the JPK-Gakin Manager at the Kabupaten Sumba Timur Health Office and then used for health services for the poor that are not covered by PT Askes
They are, in other words, used to pay for
basic health services at puskesmas and the centers included in their network, such as health services provided by village midwives (examination of pregnant women, as well as assistance during labour and neo-natal care);
in-patient services at puskesmas;
simple medical procedures (small operations and stitches) at puskesmas;
referrals to hospitals;
recording and provision of medication at puskesmas and the centers included in their network;
revitalisation of posyandu; and
promotional and preventative health activities
Based upon the experiences of health providers, particularly the private and public hospitals, there are several differences in what the poor can claim from Bapel and PT Askes
These are represented in tabular form in Table
The capitation funds Bapel gives to puskesmas are broken down so that allocations are clearer
PT Askes' allocation mechanism is not, and so allocations rely more on the creativity of the head of a puskesmas
Puskesmas heads hold a lot of authority in determining whether funds will be allocated to programs or used to improve medical services
To date, there have not been any significant problems with either system
After one year (i.e at the end of 2005), the regional government will evaluate each insurer and determine which one is better
The other possibility is that it will continue to use both insurers, although the system will be standardized
Because it is still in the middle of the evaluation phase, there have not yet been any agreements between the regional government and PT Askes or PT Askes and either the public or private hospitals
During this transition phase, benefits made available to poor households by PT Askes are the same as that available to Group I and II civil servants
The payment covers in-patient treatment in third-class wards and a restricted number of services
Both the public regional hospital and Kristen Lindimara Private Hospital have questioned the prices of the medication benefits offered by PT Askes, because they are so low that they could cause financial losses for hospitals
THE INSURED
The task of recording the number of poor people in villages was carried out by a village team, consisting of the village head and his/her assistants, village health workers such as midwives, pustu workers and assistants, as well as village/kecamatan statisticians who were coordinated by the camat
Initially, village officials had a larger role in determining who was poor
In the following year, however, the poor paid closer attention to these activities because of the information they received from different people, such as village midwives and assistants
In 2003, as many as 129,074 poor people were covered, but this rose to 159,037 people in 2004
Based upon 2003 data from Statistics Indonesia, however, 198,940 people or around 75% of the population in Kabupaten Sumba Timur were poor
The Health Office and associated agencies, such as staff at puskesmas including village midwives, village statisticians and assistants, also collected data on the poor
In October 2003, data on the poor was verified and it was found that the number of poor people had actually increased
This increase in the number of poor people was due to the data collection period in the second phase being relatively longer than the first which was only three months
Apart from this, in the first phase the ability of workers to reach poor households was restricted by the fact that most houses are dispersed over a large area and families often move
In the first period (2003), there were many complaints and requests from the poor who had not received health cards, but this was corrected through data verification in 2004
In 2005, PT Askes will manage funds for 81,200 poor people based upon funding allocations set at the national level (Minister of Health's decree), whereas Bapel will manage the JPKGakin program for 77,837 people
Each program covers a different service area
PT Askes manages poor households that are serviced by five puskesmas in regions close to the kabupaten capital while Bapel covers 12 puskesmas in regions further from the kabupaten capital
D
THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS 
There are only two types of healthcare providers in Kabupaten Sumba Timur, that is type I and III
There are no type II healthcare providers because outpatient services are not available at the hospitals
In the agreement between Bapel and the hospitals (both the public hospital and Lindimara Private Hospital), the holders of health insurance cards are only able to receive outpatient services at puskesmas, and thus hospitals become places just for referred in-patients
Health cards cannot be used for outpatient services at the hospitals
This agreement is designed to ensure that puskesmas function more as the closest places to obtain community health services, especially considering that puskesmas receive capitation funds for services provided to the poor
It is expected that communities can make maximum use of these funds
Type I healthcare providers are puskesmas
There are 17 puskesmas in Kabupaten Sumba Timur; five of them have in-patient facilities
There are also 60 pustu and 82 polindes
These puskesmas are spread across 15 kecamatan
There are two kecamatans which have two puskesmas, that is Kecamatan Waingapu – the kabupaten capital – and Kecamatan Nggaha Oriangu
Five puskesmas do not have a doctor, that is the puskesmas in Tanarara, Kananggar, Mahar and Lailunggi as well as a new puskesmas at Nggaha Oriangu
The puskesmas signed one-year contracts with Bapel
The obligations of each party were written in the contracts and they became the foundation from which puskesmas could work to serve the poor
The contracts also specified the amount of capitation funds and allocations to be paid to the puskesmas, as well as the level of service and the obligation of puskesmas to reach certain levels of utilization
Puskesmas services are often available 24 hours a day
Although officially they only provide consultations between 8 and 11am, they continue to see patients outside of these hours in recognition of the fairly long distances between houses and puskesmas (in general, patients have to travel 1-2 hours on foot)
The staff who work at Puskesmas Nggoni live close to the puskesmas, as does the doctor, so that it is easy to see patients who arrive outside of working hours
Hospitals There are two hospitals in Kabupaten Sumba Timur; the regional hospital owned by the government and the Lindimara Christian Hospital, a private hospital that also accepts referral patients with a JPK-Gakin card
Referral patients must have a referral from a puskesmas and must have stayed in that puskesmas for 48 hours
The holders of health cards are allowed to choose which hospital they are referred to
Village residents who are referred to hospitals usually choose the private hospital because it is closer (transport is easier) and they are more satisfied with the services provided by its doctors
This information, however, is not based on data but anecdotal evidence provided by puskesmas patients
In addition, the head of Lindimara Hospital explained that both hospitals have the same standards and provide the same services for patients, but that doctors visit patients more regularly at Lindimara Hospital
The condition of the buildings and cleanliness at both the public and private hospitals are fairly good
The public hospital has 95 rooms and the private hospital has 40
The class 1 and class 4 rooms used by health cardholders are clean
It is, however, difficult to keep the hospitals clean due to the community's (patients' and their families') habit of chewing betel nut
Because both men and women chew betel nut, there is a lot of red spittle in the hospitals and it is difficult to clean
The private hospital has put up a sign in the corner of one room to warn against spitting
E
REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM 
Bapel uses a capitation system for puskesmas
Puskesmas receive JPK-Gakin funds in the form of capitation at the beginning of each year from Bapel
In 2005, however, five puskesmas received capitation funds from PT Askes rather than Bapel
The premium for each poor person who seeks medical treatment at a puskesmas is Rp1,000
Fourty percent of the capitation funds received by puskesmas every three months are used to purchase medications
Sixty percent is used to increase the quality and scope of health services, of which 15% is used to pay for the services provided by puskesmas workers
Puskesmas capitation funds are used to pay for the treatment of poor outpatients
Expenses for in-patient care and small operations are claimed instead of being covered by capitation funds
For example, stitches can be claimed from Bapel and are not covered by puskesmas capitation funds
Bapel also uses a claim system for the hospitals
Hospitals can claim all expenses related to the supply of medications and provision of services to the poor back from Bapel
To date, the agreement between hospitals and Bapel relates to prescribing medications and medication premiums
Bapel agrees with almost all claims the hospitals make to Bapel, although discussions are still continuing about several types of medication used by the hospitals that are not included on the DPHO list
Hospitals can send claims to Bapel once a month but they are often more than a month late
Bapel reimburses the money around two to four weeks after the claims have been submitted
Based upon Bapel's experiences, the private hospital is more organized in making claims, both in relation to timeliness as well as the paperwork submitted for each claim
This would definitely assist the claim verification team that works at Bapel
PT Askes has organized a benefits package for in-patient treatment at hospitals that reaches Rp63,000 per person per day
This covers laboratory expenses, the use of simple equipment and doctors' fees
Both hospitals have accepted this package, but in relation to medication claims, they feel that the standard price of medication set by PT Askes is too low and could result in financial losses for the hospitals
PT Askes values Amoxicillin, for example, at Rp22,000, whereas its market price can reach Rp48,000
There is, as yet, no agreement about how the hospitals can make claims with PT Askes
But in the meantime the system established by PT Askes treats claims from the poor the same as that from level III civil servants
The hospitals have a lighter workload managing JPK-Gakin compared with the management of funds for the health sector of the national social security scheme (JPS-BK)
At present, hospitals can concentrate on just providing health services and leave claiming expenses for treating the poor to Bapel
In general, Bapel agrees with the claims submitted as long as they correspond with the joint service agreement
F
THE HEALTH CARD 
Each poor household has had a blue health card since 1 January 2004
By showing these cards, they receive free medical treatment at healthcare facilities, such as pustu, polindes, puskesmas and hospitals, as well as from midwives
Almost all of the households recorded as poor in the region (32,122 households) have obtained a health card, but not all families have due to restrictions in data collection
There are still complaints from communities, village officials and health workers because some extremely poor households have not received a health card
As a result, data on the poor was verified between August and October 2004, showing an increase in the poor population to 159,037 individuals or 34,626 households
Meanwhile, PT Askes has organized a different health card for the poor in its areas, but these cards are for individuals rather than households
These cards are different from Bapel's cards that cover one household
The cards for individuals will be distributed by PT Askes through the East Sumba regional government, although no further information was available at the time this research was undertaken about which agencies within the regional government would be responsible for this task
Bapel is responsible for the supply of cards, but will only provide cards for those poor people covered by a particular puskesmas
Puskesmas record the names of poor families and family members they are responsible for
The cards include information such as family name, family members, index number and the health card's expiry date
After these cards are signed by the head of a puskesmas, they are handed over to a village head via a midwife or pustu worker
Towards the end of January 2005 when the SMERU and World Bank team carried out its field study, people had still not received their new cards
They generally still used their old cards that had expired on 31 December 2004 to obtain medical treatment at a puskesmas
These old cards can still be used because Bapel has not finished producing the new cards
III
THE FUNCTIONING OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEME A
IDENTIFICATION AND VERIFICATION OF THE POOR 
The eight criteria for determining the poor used in verifying the data in 2004 were chosen through consultations with several parties including the Kabupaten Committee Team, or the camat and village head as well as their assistants
Based upon the above criteria and complaints from people who had not received a health card (despite being assessed as very poor by village officials and midwives), the number of poor people in East Sumba increased from 129,074 to 159,037 between 2003 and 2004, and this number became a reference for the distribution of cards for the 2005 JPK-Gakin program
At the initial stage of recording the number of poor people (2003), the regional government did not use the criteria which had been mutually agreed upon, and so the East Sumba regional government relied upon the data from village heads and their assistants, including village health workers such as village midwives, pustu workers, kecamatan officials, village statisticians and their assistants
It is inappropriate to use the criteria used by the National Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN) in East Sumba because community characteristics are different from Java and other regions
For example, BKKBN's criteria relating to the floor of a house concludes that the house of a poor family would have a dirt floor
For the community in East Sumba, a dirt floor does not necessarily mean that a household is poor, but can in fact mean that it is better off because they own enough livestock to maintain a dirt floor
It is quite difficult to obtain information about the poor in East Sumba because houses are spread out and many people are still nomadic
making it difficult to include families in village records
Data collection is funded using the regional government's general allocation funds
Initially, each surveyor received a fee of Rp60,000 per person for three days
There was no information regarding the funds for data collection in the second phase (October 2003)
Financing Funds for the JPK-Gakin program are provided by the central and regional governments
Funds from the central government are transfers from the fuel subsidy reduction fund or PKPS-BBM and these are supported by funds from the East Sumba regional government's budget
There are two types of activities that are funded by this money, namely main activities and supporting activities
These include
payment for in-patient treatment for patients referred to hospitals;
payment for in-patient treatment at puskesmas;
mobile services provided by puskesmas;
medication and medical equipment expenses;
hepatitis B vaccinations;
transport costs for referral patients; and
management expenses (participant verification, healthcare management and financial management)
Other activities funded
Payments for transporting medication by puskesmas to the district Health Office; and
Monitoring and control (e.g blended food)
The JPK-Gakin program managed by Bapel has allocations for expenses relating to patients' transport and retrieving medication from the Health Office's pharmaceutical warehouse
This is important remembering that health facilities and households are spread out and distant from the kabupaten capital
There are, however, no payments for these expenses under the insurance program managed by PT Askes, which would make it more difficult for people who have to obtain treatment as an in-patient at hospital
The same applies for puskesmas
If there are no reimbursements for retrieving medication, puskesmas will be forced to allocate funds themselves
This is quite difficult for puskesmas
Capitation funds transferred to puskesmas do not cover expenses associated with transporting referral patients to hospital
Expenses for in-patients, minor operations and stitches are submitted to Bapel as claims from puskesmas
Thus, puskesmas receive two types of funding, that is capitation funds which are distributed every three months and claim funds
Forty percent of capitation funds are provided to purchase medications and 60% to cover puskesmas operational expenses
Puskesmas, however, only manage 60% of the capitation funds as the remaining 40%, that is used to purchase pharmaceuticals, is managed by the Health Office
Puskesmas only obtain their medical supplies as they are required
Based on Bapel's experiences in handling claims from the two hospitals that receive referral patients, there have been several problems including claims being submitted late (more than a month), claims lacking prescriptions and claims for medication not included in the scheme
This more often occurs with the East Sumba Regional Hospital than the Lindimara Private Hospital
Based on calculations from the Bapel team and consultants from GTZ, the average amount of funding spent on the poor by puskesmas and hospitals is only Rp3,450 per person per month, or Rp41,400 per person per year
These calculations take into account promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative treatment, and even include individuals who are not poor because they also use medication/facilities directed at the poor
The small amount of funds spent on the poor indicates that funds allocated by the central and regional governments could be saved and that the remainder – which is quite a lot of money – could be used for services provided in the following year
However, could this also be the case with the funds managed by PT Askes, which has set a premium of Rp5,000 per person per month
If not, then PT Askes will make a fairly large profit
Benefits Package In general, both poor and non-poor patients who use a health insurance card do not clearly understand that health treatments or medication is covered by the insurance rather than the puskesmas and hospitals
To date, the poor who have a health insurance card can obtain free medical treatment at puskesmas and hospitals
There is, however, no clear criteria on the rights of the poor to medical treatment as holders of health insurance cards
Patients attending the puskesmas generally said that they did not pay for anything when being treated at a puskesmas
Such was the case for puskesmas in-patients who were interviewed at Puskesmas Nggongi
Patients' experiences at hospitals, however, were different
Several inpatients at hospitals as well as puskesmas patients who had been in-patients at a hospital said that they still had to pay for medication
Poor patients have been receiving unrestricted free treatment at puskesmas, whereas this has not been fully realized for poor patients at hospitals
Both puskesmas and hospitals have signed contracts with Bapel regarding their rights and responsibilities in providing medical treatment for the poor
There has not been any explanation in these agreements or contracts regarding the rights of, or health benefits available to, the poor
This weakens the position of the poor because they are unable to obtain a convincing explanation about free treatment
As a result only a small number of the poor use these health cards for referrals to hospitals
This is due to the fact that they are afraid of having to pay for medical treatment
Such is the case in hospitals
To date, general patients with health insurance (civil servants and pensioners) can obtain free medical treatment but there are still a number of medications not covered
There is an impression that poor patients will be treated similarly if admitted as in-patients at hospitals
The poor are unaware that there are restrictions in the treatment they can receive at hospitals
For example, there is a clause that hospitals shall not provide outpatient services for the poor
The poor still do not have enough information even though they rarely receive outpatient treatment at hospitals due to the fact that they live too far away
B
PUBLICIZING HEALTH INSURANCE
Several types of media are used to spread information regarding free medical treatment for the poor
According to Bapel, the program is publicized on the radio and also through word of mouth between the public and midwives or their assistants, particularly in relation to posyandu activities
Suara Sumba [Voice of Sumba Newspaper] as well as displays shown and cassettes played at puskesmas are other ways Bapel spreads information about the free medical treatment program
The effectiveness is greater where communities are more likely to seek medical assistance at puskesmas or other close health facilities
The number of patients at puskesmas as well as in-patients at hospitals has increased
Medicine The Health Office manages those funds that are used to purchase medication for the poor
These are sourced from the compensatory funds for the reduction in the fuel subsidy as well as from the regional government
Based on monthly requests, puskesmas can obtain the required medication from the kabupaten-level pharmaceutical warehouse
For medication needs, puskesmas receive funds from the JPK-Gakin allocation funds
Medication for the poor and non-poor is not separated on either an administrative or funding basis
Both puskesmas included in the sample for this study stated that there had not been any problems in relation to the type and quality of medication supplies
Requests for medication from puskesmas can always be met by the kabupaten-level Health Office
The Health Office and Bapel ensure there is cooperation with hospitals, as well as the DPRD, non-government organizations and community figures, in reaching agreements on the type and price of medication that should be made available for the poor
Meanwhile, PT Askes is also involved in managing funds for the poor, but decisions regarding the determination of the type and price of medication for the poor have not been discussed with hospitals
The two hospitals complain that the standard price of medication offered by PT Askes is too low
So far, coordination between hospitals and Bapel has been quite good, meaning that the medication prices set by Bapel are considered to match the standard market prices
Apart from this, hospitals can also use medication not included on the DPHO list if there is a logical reason
Before coming to an agreement about medication claims, the hospitals and Bapel actually discussed the possible situations where hospitals could prescribe medication not included on the DPHO list
In relation to PT Askes, the hospitals were not able to negotiate at the kabupaten level because all of PT Askes' policies are centralized
IV
EXPERIENCES FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES
Kabupaten Sumba Timur is a poor region because its poor geographical conditions (land is infertile and rocky), low education levels and poor health levels result in poor community health
The community very much needs government assistance in the form of the JPKGakin program considering that 75% of its population are poor
In general, health cardholders make use of medical treatment at the available facilities
The major issues for the poor are the distance between houses and the limited, and sometimes even expensive, transport
Malaria is one of the major diseases for residents in this kabupaten
There is a prevailing lack of knowledge in the community about healthy lifestyles, good nutrition, cleanliness in the home and surrounding environment as well as physical fitness
The most important health program other than the provision of free medical treatment for the poor is improving the community's basic lifestyle
Animals from chickens, pigs and goats to cattle, buffalo and horses wander around gardens and roads
Their faeces which is everywhere causes bacteria to grow
Both women and men have a habit of chewing betel nut and they spit it out anywhere
In the dry season, residents suffer from water shortages
The JPK-Gakin program managed by Bapel has not resulted in many problems so far for either puskesmas or hospitals
Most of the complaints are about administrative matters such as not receiving a health card, whereas there have only been a few complaints regarding the health services provided
As the PT Askes system of managing JPK-Gakin has been applied, health services for the poor in East Sumba will be the same as that for communities in other regions of Indonesia
Distances and the level of difficulty in reaching health facilities is a major problem for the poor
If a family member falls ill, they need transport in order to access health facilities, but they cannot afford the cost
There is a similar problem if they are referred to hospital
Despite hospitals providing free treatment, they often need a lot of money to cover the cost of transporting the family member to hospital as well as food
These difficulties often result in them not wanting to be referred to hospital
Health Provider I (Puskesmas Nggongi)
This puskesmas is located around 150km from the kabupaten capital and can be accessed via three different asphalt roads, which are not entirely smooth, but can be used by fourwheeled vehicles
There is only one bus that services this area and it only runs once a day
In the wet season, several parts of these roads wash away, and thus it becomes difficult for four-wheeled vehicles to use them
Puskesmas Nggongi is located in Kecamatan Karera, which has a population of 10,863
Of this population, a total of 8,983 people are classified as poor
This puskesmas which was built in 1972 has had a ten-bed in-patients room since 1972
In-patient facilities are very important for the community in Karera considering the distance they need to travel to reach in-patient facilities at the hospital
The doctor and nurses live next to the puskesmas making it easier for patients who arrive outside of working hours
This puskesmas has several sources of funds, including
1
Fees of Rp1,500 from community members who receive medical treatment (around Rp3 million per year); 2
Operational expenses of Rp15 million per year; 3
Routine expenses (the Health Office reimburses the puskesmas for any routine expenses); 4
Ten million rupiah is allocated for in-patient treatment per year; 5
Expenses for the pustu under the puskesmas of Rp1.5 million per year; and 6
Expenses for the polindes of Rp1 million per year
The puskesmas receives funds for all of these expenses from the kabupaten-level Health Office
In 1989, there was a diarrhoea epidemic in the region, but at that time there was only a health worker and no doctor
There was no doctor assigned to this puskesmas until 1995, and this doctor has since been replaced seven times, mostly by temporary doctors
The most recent doctor, however, is a civil servant and has worked at the puskesmas for two years
In addition to the doctor, there are three midwives and five nurses and health workers
There are 13 people who work at this puskesmas but this is insufficient to meet demand because, in addition to serving three pustu and 26 posyandu in ten remote villages, one of the villages is on an island
At the time of field research, there were two in-patients
one infected with malaria and the other with wounds from a wild pig attack
On average, only one or two people are referred to hospital per month
Patients who are not too sick can be cared for at the puskesmas with its simple in-patient facilities
The most common disease is malaria, although it was not until 2001 that the puskesmas had a trained malaria laboratory technician, and since around 2003, with the assistance of World Vision, the puskesmas has had an adequate microscope to detect malaria
Number of patients referred to hospital in 2003 from Puskesmas Nggongi January – 1 February – 1 March – 2 April – 2 May – none June – none July – 1 August – 4 September – 2 October – 2 November – none December – 3 January (2004) – 2 There are no private doctors or midwife practices because most people are poor
The majority of the population seek assistance from traditional healers during labor as they are close
They pay those who assist during labor with anything, sometimes Rp20,000 or a chicken, that is if they do not feed the midwife
Or they just say thank you
Livestock, such as cattle, horses and pigs, are generally left to wander around the kecamatan
Animal faeces is widespread, making the environment dirty, including that near the puskesmas
The doctor and puskesmas workers are unable to advise the community to tie up their livestock in their yards so that they do not pollute the environment
This is because the community leaders own thousands of animals and let them graze freely
There are three community leaders, one who is referred to as the ‘king' and another is the village head
They are classified as rich and own a lot of livestock and land (thousands of cows, pigs and horses)
The animals they own are left to graze on the roads around the village and kecamatan
Doctors often experience personal conflicts because of this in the areas where they work
Health Provider II (Puskesmas Lewa)
This puskesmas serves around 19,767 people, 78.61% of whom are poor
In December 2004, 1,127 of the 1,578 patients were poor, meaning 71% of the patients who obtained medical treatment at the puskesmas were poor
There are 15 health workers, including one doctor, five pustu, 12 polindes and 31 posyandu (three people assist at each posyandu)
Puskesmas Lewa also has in-patient facilities with 11 beds, which are supervised in three shifts morning, afternoon and night
The village head, community leaders, religious leaders and dusun heads are all involved in publicizing the health cards in Lewa
Women, however, obtain explanations from the posyandu
People who have assisted with posyandu activities on a voluntary basis have been involved in distributing and filling in health cards
For their work, they are paid Rp250 per card and free treatment at the puskesmas
There is also a male assistant at this puskesmas, which is unusual as most workers are female
In this area he has a very important role however, because males are needed to reach isolated areas, especially if they need to ride a horse to deliver immunization medication
V
IMPORTANT ISSUES REGARDING THE FUNCTIONING OF HEALTH INSURANCE 1
Bapel's management of health insurance in the kabupaten at this time is proceeding smoothly
Identification of poor families and the distribution of cards is being fully undertaken by Bapel
Shortcomings during the identification process continue to be rectified in parallel with modification of the criteria as well as identification in the field together with reports from the community
Likewise with the health service reimbursement funds which has not drawn a lot of complaints from the hospital
2
In accordance with the Minister's directive concerning the appointment of PT Askes as the manager of health insurance for the poor, the government of Kabupaten Sumba Timur has split the management of this insurance program on the basis of area of operation
At the time the research was being conducted, PT Askes had not started operations because it was waiting for an implementation order from PT Askes central administration
3
Because it is still in the early phase of implementation, PT Askes cannot yet determine the nature of the operating system that will be applied in East Sumba
If the regulations have been decided by PT Askes central administration, they will work jointly with the local government authority and especially Bapel and the Health Office to obtain the names of poor families
Bapel as the previous manager has experience in identifying poor families and the local government administration has the regional authority so good cooperation is absolutely necessary
4
What is clearly understood by the hospitals, both the local public hospital (RSUD) and Lindimara private hospital is that reimbursement of medications originates from PT Askes
They hope PT Askes will not be too rigid in applying the regulations on medications for the poor
At this time, cooperation between the hospitals and Bapel has been proceeding smoothly
All obstacles that arise and the adjustment of the regulations on medication can be jointly discussed so that there is no disadvantage to the hospitals or the patients
5
The decision of the local government administration to split the operational area between two managers of JPK-Gakin also requires adjustment in administration for the hospitals
Bapel, who until now applied reimbursement of transport allowances for poor families who were referred to hospital, will continue to apply this policy even though the operational area has now been split into two
On the other side, PT Askes has already determined that there will be no reimbursement of the cost of transport for the poor who are referred to hospital
This determination could certainly give rise to jealousy among the poor
Likewise with several larger variables on compensation for the type of medication and illnesses that will be covered by PT Askes and Bapel that will also be different
6
It is expected all these differences won't give rise to difficulties for the poor in accessing health services
Making Services Work for the Poor in Indonesia
A Report on Health Financing Mechanisms in Kabupaten Tabanan, Bali
A Case Study
one of the basic right of all citizens, the Government of Indonesia (GoI) has promoted programs on health care financing for the poor
One of these programs is the Jaminan Pemeliharaan Kesehatan (JPK)
In 2003, the pilot project on JPK for the poor (JPK-Gakin) started in 15 districts and two provinces, and was expanded to additional regions the following year
Since April 1 2004, PT Askes, a profit oriented private insurance company, was assigned as the insurer of the nonprofit health insurance scheme for the poor (the JPK-Gakin) in district Tabanan
With respect to PT Askes it is important to see in what ways does the prominent role of PT Askes influence the dynamics of health service delivery and how different is PT Askes from other insurers (the non-profit - public institutions) in managing the JPK-Gakin scheme
The Tabanan case demonstrated that the supervision and monitoring by the Dinas Kesehatan (DinKes) of an insurer like Askes runs the risks of being less effective because PT Askes is a relatively well-established institution that is totally independent of the DinKes
Moreover, there is a difference in the level of expertise and experience between PT Askes and the Dinkes regarding the management of insurance schemes
Therefore, the supervision and monitoring of PT Askes by the DinKes tends to be “formal” instead of “actual.” This difference in the level of expertise and experience can also be a barrier for the DinKes to negotiate the cost and coverage of the scheme with PT Askes
PT Askes – as the insurer – is also barely involved in the promotion and socialization of the program and the identification of the poor as their potential clients
Obviously, the JPK-Gakin scheme can secure primary health care for the poor (the gakin) at the puskesmas, but this does not necessarily mean that the poor will receive good quality care
In general, the health care at the puskesmas is quite limited both in term of quality and variety
The implementation of the JPK-Gakin scheme –including adequate capitation for the puskesmas from this scheme– would certainly not change this condition easily as it relates to more complex factors such as the availability of good medical staffs, instruments and facilities
The most positive effect of the JPK-Gakin scheme on the provision of health care for the poor is the possibility to get secondary and tertiary health care that is usually unaffordable for the poor
Nevertheless, for a range of different reasons, the majority of Gakin patients are not referred to the hospital
There are cases where the poor refused to be referred to the hospital although it was necessary because they were insecure about the additional costs that were not covered by PT Askes
Thus, although the JPK-Gakin scheme does secure the right of the poor to get medical treatment at the hospital, it cannot secure the actualization of it

I
INTRODUCTION 
Based on the notion that good health is one of the basic rights of all citizens, the Government of Indonesia (GoI) has promoted programs on health care financing for the poor
In 1998, the GoI introduced JPS-BK program to provide healthcare for the poor through community healthcare centers (puskemas) and village midwives (bidan desa)
In 2001, the GoI introduced the PDPSE-BK program
This program, inter alia, consisted of the provision of medicines and Hepatitis-B vaccine for the primary health care
In 2002, the program was renamed into PKPS-BBM Health Sector
Nevertheless, a more effective, efficient and sustainable financing mechanism is needed as the costs of health provision for the poor increase and become a greater burden on the budget of the local government (APBD)
For this reason, the GoI has developed a health-financing scheme, namely the Jaminan Pemeliharaan Kesehatan (JPK)
In 2003, the pilot project on JPK for the poor (JPK untuk keluarga miskin/JPK-Gakin) started in 15 districts and two provinces in Indonesia, and was expanded to additional regions the following year
In general referred to as JPK-Gakin, the individual schemes do contain many significant differences in the characteristics of the scheme provided and who has initiated or been assigned as the health insurance provider
Three of the main differences include the insurer, the benefit package and the reimbursement system
In most cases, the Management Unit, Badan Pengelola (Bapel), consisting of members of the district Health Department and hospital doctors is the health insurance provider, whereas in two cases (Musi Banyuasin, Sumatra and Tabanan, Bali), PT Askes is the insurer
PT Askes is an organization that has a long history and experience of insurance provision and is a forprofit organization
The districts are not tied to the provision of certain benefit packages and thus differences in benefit packages have also arisen
Some districts cover all available healthcare services that extend to providers outside the region, other districts have a more limited benefit package
Various evaluation studies (e.g by ILO in 2003) have concluded that the JPK-Gakin scheme has not been successful in facilitating an accessible, affordable and sustainable health service for the poor
Problems such as low benefits, lack of institutional framework and poor management were mentioned as the reasons for the failure
In this case study however, we aim to look at the effects of these different characteristics of the health financing mechanism on healthcare service provision, quality of health care provision and how insurance characteristics can influence the relationships between stakeholders
Some districts have managed to implement and continue the scheme relatively well
This study examines a number of pertinent questions
These include
Why have some districts been more successful in implementing the JPK-Gakin program than other districts
What are the barriers to better service delivery for the poor
What factors influence significant improvements of these services
Three districts were selected for the case studies; Purbalingga (Central Java), Tabanan (Bali) and East Sumba (Nusa Tenggara Timur)
Each of these districts was selected for a specific reason
Purbalingga was the first district to provide health insurance for the poor; a scheme that was its own initiative
As it now has a number of years of experience, an assessment on the sustainability of the scheme can also be undertaken
In addition, Purbalingga provides a benefit package for different premiums depending on people's income; thereby increasing the outreach of the program
The second visit was to the district of Tabanan, where a scheme is provided through PT Askes, a profit-oriented private company
The intention of the Department of Health (DepKes) “to provide JPK-Gakin in all districts by PT Askes in 2005” is another reason to include a scheme run by PT Askes
Until the end of 2004 there were only two districts where JPK-Gakin was provided by PT Askes; Musi Banyuasin (Sumatra) and Tabanan (Bali)
With respect to PT Askes it is important to see how an external body can interact with health provision and health management stakeholders and how their experience with providing insurance contributes to the provision of health insurance to the poor
Tabanan is a “second-generation JPK-Gakin” that was introduced in 2004
Including Tabanan in this case study provides an opportunity to examine its initial experiences with the provision of health insurance to the poor
The third case study area, East Sumba, is one district that has a very high poverty rate and thus the provision of health insurance can have a major influence in increasing access to health care for the poor
East Sumba is also a district that experiences many problems with distance as the population is spread over a wide area
Based on the three case studies an executive summary will be constructed that gives more information about the effects of the different characteristics of the health insurance programs
In Tabanan, PT Askes was assigned as the insurer or the Badan Pengelola (Bapel) of the nonprofit health insurance scheme for the poor
The majority of the 25 districts, which were assigned as pilot project areas (daerah uji coba) of JPK-Gakin, have implemented different management systems by using a Badan Pengelola/Bapel JPKM
This is a management unit consisting of at least four fulltime staff, including a unit head (the main coordinator) and three other staff who will manage the membership, finance and health service
In what ways does the prominent role of PT Askes influence the dynamics of health service delivery
How different is PT Askes from Bapel in managing the JPK-Gakin scheme and why
This report attempts to answer these questions
II
THE HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEME A
THE COMMENCEMENT 
Unlike most other pilot areas, the health insurance scheme for the poor (JPK-Gakin) in Tabanan district is managed by PT Askes
Consequently, the scheme is also commonly known as Askes–Gakin
The scheme started in April 1st 2004 when the Tabanan district was awarded the status of “Area of Development” (Daerah Pengembangan)
According to the Dinas Kesehatan (DinKes) Tabanan district, they purposely assigned PT Askes as the insurer of JPK-Gakin for two reasons
1
DinKes Tabanan wanted to avoid the risk of failure that can cause serious financial problems
They learned from the mismanagement of Dana Sehat (the previous health financing mechanism for the poor) by inexperienced institutions in other regions
2
PT Askes is seen as a professional institution that has the required length of experience in managing insurance schemes and has a wide coverage area
It therefore has the ability to service the whole Bali province, thus allowing for a possible expansion of the scheme and thus increasing the risk pool
Another organization other than PT Askes with the ability to cover the whole region is not available
Each stakeholder involved in the JPK-Gakin scheme claimed to be the initiator of the scheme
The DinKes suggested that they took the first step, by contacting and proposing PT Askes to manage the JPK-Gakin in Tabanan
On the other hand, PT Askes and even the public hospital (Badan Rumah Sakit Umum/BRSU) of Tabanan also suggested that they were the initiators of a health financing mechanism for the poor in Tabanan
Referring to the fact that Bali does not have large industries with many employees (who would be potential members of Askes) and that most hotel employees are already insured by the Jamsostek, I Wayan Sumarta from PT Askes Tabanan said that PT Askes has implemented a more assertive policy of recruitment in Bali
PT Askes needs to look for potential members in various groups or institutions
According to the Denpasar branch of PT Askes, one of these recruitment efforts involves sending proposals on the health insurance scheme to many institutions as well as every district in Bali
Nevertheless, only Tabanan and Buleleng districts were interested in the proposal
The management of the public hospital (BRSU Tabanan) also saw themselves as the initiator of the health financing mechanism
According to them, they were concerned about the provision of an affordable health care system for the poor and, therefore, made a proposal to the DinKes on this issue
It will remain unclear who really took the first step to initiate the financing mechanism for the poor in Tabanan since all of the main stakeholders claim to be the initiator and they were (and still are) interconnected in their actions
It is likely that all of them did react to a central government program from their own position and perspective, and all have influenced the start of the JPK-Gakin (or the Askes-Gakin) in Tabanan
As was mentioned earlier, the Musi Banyuasin district (Palembang) also has assigned PT Askes as the insurer of JPK-Gakin
As Tabanan is included in the second wave of districts that implemented JPK-Gakin, it expected to be informed by the central administrations of the Department of Health and/or PT Askes
On the question of whether they were able to learn from the experiences in the first district, Musi Banyuasin (Muba), the Dinas Kesehatan claimed that they only knew about Musi Banyuasin from the meeting in Cisarua, Puncak in December 2004
The Ministry of Health did not inform DinKes Tabanan about the similar mechanism used by Musi Banyuasin district on the health financing mechanism for the poor
B
THE INSURER AND THE FINANCING MECHANISM 
The PT (Persero) Asuransi Kesehatan Indonesia/PT Askes (Denpasar branch) covers four districts
Tabanan, Buleleng, Badung and Jembrana
The Denpasar office is assisted by an office in Tabanan that is located at the public hospital (BRSU “Rumah Kita”)
In Tabanan, apart from civil servants and retirees (about 33,000 insured), PT Askes also manages other health insurance schemes that are funded by the provincial government (Pemerintah Daerah Tingkat I) namely
1
Health insurance for village officials started in 1997 (1,500 – 2,000 insured, premium
Rp.5,000/person/month, covers health care services provided according to the 3rd class in-patient standard at the BRSU)
2
Health insurance for the Sulinggih and Bende seadat (religious leaders) started in 2000 (500 insured, premium
Rp.25,000/person/month, covers health care services provided according to 1st class in-patient standard at the RSUD)
3
Health insurance for the Pemangku Satu Kayangan (other category of religious leaders), that started in 2002 and has a similar premium and coverage as the health insurance scheme for Sulinggih and Bende seadat
In general, the membership of Askes can be categorized into
1
Askes Social (Kepesertaan Sosial)
civil servants and retirees; 2
Askes Commercial (Kepesertaan Sukarela)
private companies, BUMN with a premium of Rp.15,000/month; 3
Askes-Gakin (starting Jan 1st, 2005, based on the Minister of Health's (Republic of Indonesia) Decree number 1241/MENKES/SK/XI/2004, premium Rp.5,000/ person/month)
Cooperation between DinKes Tabanan and ASKES Bali is formally regulated based on a oneyear contract with PT Askes, which can be extended annually
This contract covers the period April 1st, 2004 - March 31st, 2005 and regulates various aspects of JPK-Gakin Management, for instance the reimbursement system, the premium, rights and responsibilities of stakeholders, the provision of health services, the benefit package, arbitration of conflict, force majeure, etc
The contract does not, however, regulate how unspent health funds would be used
When, in 2004, there was indeed money left from the health funds, PT Askes considered it to be available for their disposal
Nevertheless, the DinKes Tabanan demanded and negotiated an outcome that resulted in PT Askes retaining 20% of the unspent funds with a part of the remaining funds (in the form of durable assets such as computers, cars etc.) being returned to DinKes
For 2005, the contract will be revised and unspent funds will be rolled over into the funds for the new term
According to the evaluation on the implementation of JPK-Gakin scheme in 2004 carried out by the DinKes Tabanan, the unspent funds totalled Rp.33,026,000
This amount is based on a financial report made by PT Askes for the period of January – November 2004
Interestingly, the reported period is not consistent with the term of the JPK-Gakin contract
The contract was issued, and the formal cooperation period was started, three months later than the date of commencement of actual cooperation
The three months gap between the date of commencement of actual and formal cooperation between the main stakeholders of the JPK-Gakin scheme in Tabanan could be the result of different causes; from simple administration delay, strategic calculation, a tough negotiation process up to a flexible relationship between main stakeholders which is based on trust
On the basis of the investigation undertaken for this report, it appears that the DinKes Tabanan and PT Askes have had a cooperative relationship since the inception of the agreement
This is different to other districts (for example in Purbalingga and East Sumba) where PT Askes involvement in JPK-Gakin management is accepted only reluctantly by the district government
DinKes Tabanan was also questioned about their decision to cooperate with a private and profit oriented company like PT Askes in managing a non-profit health financing mechanism for the poor
Specifically, whether DinKes negotiates with PT Askes about the limitations they set on the benefit package as a result of commercial calculations
DinKes admitted that they are gradually becoming aware of, and learning to deal with, the commercial side of PT Askes as the JPK-Gakin insurer
PT Askes, for instance, does not reimburse a number of more costly treatments, medication and referrals to Sanglah Hospital
As the contract with PT Askes is an annual contract, DinKes intends to revise the next contract
DinKes plans to demand that several treatments such as CT Scans be put in the benefit package and that the insured have a right of referral to Sanglah Hospital which has more facilities
Furthermore, DinKes also proposes that if there are unspent JPK-Gakin funds at the end of the contract period, DinKes will be partially reimbursed by PT Askes in the form of assets (computers, cars etc.)
Nevertheless, Dr
Arisuta from the DinKes admitted that DinKes' actual bargaining position is not powerful enough to achieve these outcomes since the APBD funds (the portion of JPK-Gakin funds that should be subsidized by the district government) have not been given to PT Askes
Until now PT Askes only operates with funds provided by the central government
C
THE INSURED Poor families (the keluarga miskin or gakin) are automatically enrolled into Askes-Gakin
In 2004, there were 10,710 gakin households or 37,791 persons in Tabanan district
This is about 9% of the district population
According to the DinKes, the criteria for the gakin in Tabanan are not clear, consequently there are poor people who were not identified and therefore were not entitled to the free health services
Nevertheless, some of them were able to assert their rights by approaching the village head, who appears to be the key to identifying the gakin, or went straight to DinKes to complain if they were not enrolled in the Askes-Gakin scheme
The enrolment takes place once a year and the new term commences each April
D
THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS The providers of primary health care (Penyedia Pelayanan Kesehatan/PPK I) are in the 19 puskesmas in Tabanan, including their secondary health centers or puskesmas pembantu (pustu) and village maternity polyclinics or poliklinik bersalin desa (polindes)
None of these puskesmas have in-patient facilities
People are not obliged to attend the puskesmas closest to their house to receive free health services
Patients are thus able to choose what pukesmas they want to attend and that will be recorded on their card
In practice, some people did go to different puskesmas than what is written on their card
This is usually tolerated for only a few times as it puts an administrative burden on the puskesmas because they get capitation only for the number of gakin in their working area
Different maternity care services from different health care providers are included in the benefit package
Patients can go to the hospital to see a doctor or a nurse, but they can also receive services from the village midwife at the puskesmas, pustu, or polindes
Almost every village midwife runs a small private clinic outside her working hours at the puskesmas, pustu or polindes although the cost of childbirth in this private clinic ranges between Rp500,000 and Rp.700,000 (this is quite similar to the cost of childbirth in a public hospital)
The reimbursement that the midwife receives from Askes for delivery is a maximum of Rp.100,000 and, as a consequence, the midwife provides a service under the asking price
As the income from gakin patients is so little, there is no incentive for the midwife to provide their services to the poor and so they are referred to the hospital
This policy was made to ensure that the poor will go to the hospital to give birth
This can prevent a higher cost in the situation where the patient has to be sent to the hospital anyway because there are complications during the childbirth which cannot be handled by the midwife
If the insured uses the services of Tabanan public hospital (BRSU), all costs will be covered by PT Askes
The utilization rate of maternity care services in the hospital has not altered since the implementation of the health insurance scheme
It may well be that patients are being referred to the hospital, but are actually not going there for other reasons
It could be that a change in doctors at a late stage of pregnancy is not a preferred option or, alternatively, that the distance from the patient's home to the hospital is too great
The provider of secondary health care (PPK II) is the public hospital (BRSU ‘Rumah Kita', Tabanan)
As there is no private hospital, this is the only hospital in the district
The hospital manages its own resources and is independent of other financing
It only receives funding from the local government for the salaries of civil servant staff (who constitute approximately 50% of total staff numbers)
In theory, gakin patients can only be treated at the hospital after obtaining a referral letter from a puskesmas
Exceptions to this rule are, however, made for chronic cases and emergency treatment
Nevertheless, gakin patients regularly attend the hospital without having the required referral letter
In the case of emergency care, the patient's family are usually asked to obtain a referral letter from the puskesmas within three days
We have identified several chronic illnesses for which a referral letter is, officially, not necessary, but a referral letter was still demanded by the hospital
Tertiary care can be received at the provincial hospital in Denpasar (the Rumah Sakit Sanglah) when necessary specialized care cannot be provided in the hospital in Tabanan
There have been only a few cases where a referral to Sanglah hospital has been made
In these cases, the costs were not always fully reimbursed by PT Askes and so the patient was required to make a co-payment to cover the cost of their treatment
E
THE PREMIUM 
The premium of the Askes-Gakin scheme is Rp.5,000/person/month
Of this amount, Rp.1,000 is allocated for the PPK I (the puskesmas) and Rp.4,000 is allocated for the PPK II and III (the hospitals)
The premium was calculated by the DinKes, PT Askes and the hospital
According to the DinKes, they tried to negotiate with PT Askes to get a lower premium but they (PT Askes) did not agree
According to PT Askes Denpasar, the premium has been calculated based on
1
hospital tariffs; and 2
PT Askes' experience in managing the health insurance scheme for village officials (since 1997)
The Askes–Gakin scheme is, indeed, very similar to this scheme in many aspects, including the premium and benefit package
F
THE REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM The reimbursement system for primary care is a monthly capitation based on the number of poor people who are served by primary care centers (puskesmas)
For the Askes–Gakin scheme, the puskesmas in Tabanan had already received four months capitation
The hospital is reimbursed on a fee-for-service system
This is similar to the reimbursement system of other types of health insurance scheme managed by PT Askes
Because there is an Askes office in the hospital, the reimbursement procedure – both for Askes-Gakin as well as for other Askes members - is relatively efficient and quick, with reimbursement usually in about two weeks
On average, the amount claimed by the hospital is about Rp90 million/month
It is planned that the reimbursement system for the hospital will be changed into a capitation system
Although it does not happen often, there are instances where PT Askes refused the claims from the hospital in cases with
1
administrative errors; 2
mistakes in the benefit package provided, especially if the treatment standard is higher (and thus more costly); and 3
incomplete formalities
G
THE HEALTH CARD 
PT Askes has the responsibility for producing and providing the health insurance card also known as the Askes-Gakin card
In the Askes system each member receives one card
This reduces the chance of misusing the card
However, the experience of the health care providers is that people sometimes bring the health insurance cards of other family members
The card is white and similar to the Askes card of the village officials
No photograph is required for this card
The Askes-Gakin card contains information on the identity of the insured (name, membership number and sex), the office code (kode badan usaha), benefit package code, the code of treatment standard and the term of the card
PT Askes is the producer of the cards and it should take approximately seven days for the cards to reach the insured
According to PT Askes, Tabanan, the distribution process can take up to a maximum of one month and evidence gained through our interviews with puskesmas, pustu and village officials supports this conclusion
We also found that a number of cards were not ready yet
Even those cards that have been distributed sometimes cannot be immediately used
In Tua village, for example, some cards that had just arrived contained errors requiring correction
When the cards were ready, PT Askes gives them to the DinKes and the DinKes distributed the cards to each puskesmas
The village midwife took the cards from the puskesmas and gave them to the neighborhood heads (Kepala-Kepala Dusun) who know the recipients and are able to deliver the cards in their neighborhood
III
THE FUNCTIONING OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEME A
IDENTIFICATION AND VERIFICATION OF THE POOR (GAKIN) 
The DinKes Tabanan is very proud of the fact that in 2004 they carried out the identification of the poor independently
This data, which is called the “List of Members of Poor Families in Kabupaten Tabanan – For Health Services in the Year 2003” (Daftar Anggota Keluarga Miskin di Kabupaten Tabanan – Tahun 2003 untuk Pelayanan Kesehatan) is different to the data of BPS and Bappeda
According to the DinKes, unlike BPS' and Bappeda's data, their data on the poor is free from political influences
The identification only aimed to locate, count and list the gakin of Tabanan district
In other words, the survey was primarily aimed at identifying the poor for the health insurance membership
The data is compiled in the form of a thick red book that is also available at the PT Askes office in Tabanan and to each puskesmas in the district
The book functions as the main source of information on the identity of the poor (name, age, family relationship, residential address/village etc.)
It seems useful also for the verification of the poor by providers
For the survey in 2003, there was no financial contribution from PT Askes
The identification of the poor who are eligible for health insurance was performed within a period of three months by DinKes staff, the village head, the dusun head and members of the puskesmas
After the initial year they realized that this process was not very effective and has a number of weaknesses
For next year the plan is to involve the health officials, the village midwife and volunteers from each village (kader)
These people are closer to the people in society and have greater access to the information necessary to identify those in need of health support
A second step in the process is the verification of those identified as poor and also those people who have been identified as falling outside the category of poor
In Tabanan the puskesmas performs an auditing function to correct initial identification errors
The puskesmas can notify suspected cases of misidentification to the DinKes that can undertake a verification
If those who were not initially identified as gakin are really gakin, they will get the Askes-Gakin card for the new health insurance term
Based on the experiences of the puskesmas and staff associated with this function, it seems that the criteria used to identify the poor are not very relevant or helpful in the field
These criteria were established by BKKBN on “Pra Keluarga Sejahtera” (pre-prosperous family) and ‘Keluarga Sejahtera Tahap I' (prosperous family at the first stage) and were used in the identification of the poor as the Tabanan district does not have a formal guideline such as a decree (surat keputusan/SK) on the criteria of the poor (gakin)
The DinKes admitted that the absence of a guideline is one of the obstacles in identifying the poor since this means the identification is open to different interpretations and heavily dependent on direct observation
Dr
Era from Tabanan hospital also said that the identification of gakin in Tabanan is still problematic (“tidak tepat sasaran”)
There are many known problems regarding those identified as poor and also those who remain unidentified
In several cases not all family members were registered for the health insurance card, in other instances personal information was wrongly administered
She suggested identifying gakin based on income, the number of dependent household members and local living standards
B
SOCIALIZATION OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE 
The socialization of the Askes-Gakin scheme is undertaken as a cooperative arrangement between DinKes, PT Askes and the village officials (especially the Kepala Dusun or Kelian Dinas)
Unlike the case of Purbalingga, the village midwife and kader play no role in the socialization of HI for the poor in Tabanan
In this district the socialization is mainly through the Kepala Dusun (Kelian Dinas) who should explain the scheme to the poor in their neighborhood
In Tabanan, the socialization of the Askes–Gakin scheme appears to be rather minimal
In one case, a relatively new Kepala Dusun who received health insurance cards to be distributed to the people did not know what they were for
In addition, feedback from people in the neighborhoods indicates that there are many people, in fact the majority, who had not heard about the scheme
The DinKes also recognizes that the socialization did not have optimal results
The DinKes therefore plans to involve, among others, the Kelian Adat in the socialization of the Askes- Gakin in its new term
The Kelian Adat is another category of prominent community member who knows more about local rules and customs (the awig-awig)
It can be said that the Kelian Adat has more spiritual/charismatic authority while the Kelian Dinas has more political authority
The involvement of the Kelian Adat is expected to provide an alternative way to encourage people to enrol in health insurance or to cooperate in a program
One of the major factors contributing to successful socialization is good information distribution to those who will be in charge of the socialization program
If this is not properly addressed, the addition of a new element in the socialization process (in this case the involvement of the Kelian Adat) will not improve the result
C
FINANCE 
It is calculated that the cost of Askes–Gakin in Tabanan in 2004 is about Rp.2.2 billion (Rp.2,267,820,000) per year
This consists of Rp453,492,000 (20%) for puskesmas capitation and Rp1,814,328,000 (80%) for the hospital claims
Although the allocations seem to be unbalanced and puskesmas (PPK I) receive a much smaller portion than the hospital (PPK II/III) we did not find any complaints from puskesmas that the JPK-Gakin subsidy is insufficient
The costs at the puskesmas are so much lower because the services provided at the puskesmas are first of all much cheaper than those provided at the hospital
But a second more important reason is that the puskesmas services are already highly subsidized
The puskesmas in Tabanan receives subsidies from central, provincial and district governments for the expenditures of the puskesmas
Looking at the financing of the puskesmas it becomes obvious that the funds from JPK-Gakin are more than enough to finance the health services of the poor
In fact, they have unspent monies that cannot be used for other than health service provision for the poor as they are tied funds
Sometimes the puskesmas have ideas on how to use the money to improve the quality of the puskesmas services
For example, the head of Puskesmas Tegal Ratu in Cilegon district told us that they badly needed to dig a better well since they regularly experienced lack of clean water
She even once had to close the puskesmas because they did not have clean water for a couple of days
She wanted to use the unspent portion of the subsidy to finance the well but it would be against the regulation
Puskesmas have different financial resources
1
APBD II; 2
puskesmas income (For example the patient contribution is Rp2,500/visit both in Puskesmas Penebel I and Puskemas Marga I); 3
capitation Askes-Gakin (Askes gives Rp1,000 x number of Gakin, From this amount 20% for the puskesmas head, 70% for the puskesmas staff and 10% for the puskesmas administration); and 4
claims on Askes for non-Gakin patients
During the Tabanan fieldwork, SMERU researchers visited two puskesmas namely
Puskesmas Penebel I and Puskesmas Marga I
The head of both puskesmas complained about the decreasing income from the local government budget during the last couple of years
According to the head of Puskesmas Marga I, in 2002 – 2003 they received about Rp30 million and in 2004 Rp21 million
The optimal operational costs of the puskesmas are Rp50 million but the amount available is only between Rp10 – 20 million
On the other hand, the hospitals we visited have to struggle to cover the health costs
A few of them have a large deficit
The Tabanan hospital has a deficit of Rp.780 million
They have temporarily solved this problem by delaying payment for procurements (for instance on the purchase of medicines)
According to BRSU, the deficit is also caused by the health costs of patients who are no longer identified as poor (and no longer entitled to the Askes-Gakin) but do not have the financial resources to pay the hospital bills
They referred to these kinds of patients as “pasien terlantar” or “pasien di luar system” (“patients outside the system”)
BRSU Tabanan will not, and cannot, refuse patients even though they do have money to pay the services
As a result, the hospital has to cover the costs from their own financial resources
Regarding the total cost of JPK-Gakin scheme in Tabanan District (Rp2.2 billion), it was agreed that the central government would pay Rp1.3 billion (already provided) and the district government would cover the rest of the funds needed (Rp0.9 billion) but until now, the funds promised by the district government have not been provided
D
BENEFIT PACKAGE AND SERVICES 
The benefit package includes all services available from the primary care provider (puskesmas)
In case additional or more specialized care is needed, a patient will be referred to the hospital where an insured is entitled to the third class treatment
In Tabanan, the DinKes and Askes have agreed that people who are willing and thus able to pay for a higher class of treatment are not poor and should not receive health insurance for the poor
An additional reason for this decision is that by making this regulation there should be a minimum quality standard for the puskesmas that the DinKes would like to uphold
Without regulations, real standards, and someone who bears the responsibility to accomplish this minimum quality standard, it is very difficult to achieve this
The agreement between DinKes Tabanan and PT Askes, Denpasar regulates the services that should be provided for Gakin members
For outpatient treatment at the puskesmas level
Promotive programs; 
Preventive programs; 
Curative programs (treatment and medication); and 
Issuance of referral letter (for the hospital)
For outpatient treatment at the hospital level
a
Consultation, treatment and medication by specialized doctors; b
Laboratory tests, radio and electromedic diagnoses; c
Medical treatments (including the specialized ones); and d
Medication (within the range of the official list of medicines and their prices or the DPHO)
For in-patient treatment at the hospital level
a
in-patient facilities (the 3rd class standard); b
consultation, treatment and medication by specialized doctors; c
laboratory tests, radio and electromedic diagnoses; d
various sorts of medical treatments (including major surgery); e
intensive care treatment (at the ICU); f
medication (within the range of the official list of medicines and their prices or the DPHO); and g
medical rehabilitation
E
UTILIZATION AND REFERRAL 
In Tabanan district, the utilization of Askes–Gakin is seen as still low
31.7% for outpatients at the PPK I/puskesmas (while the national standard is 40%); 2% for outpatients at the PPK II/hospital; and 0.3% for inpatients at the PPK II/hospital
According to two puskesmas that were visited during the fieldwork, they only refer special cases to the hospital (for example, the cases of high risk childbirth, cardio-vascular disease and serious injuries)
Until now, no referrals have been refused by the hospital
Sometimes patients insist on being referred to the hospital although the puskesmas can treat the disease or, on the contrary, refuse to be referred although the puskesmas cannot treat the disease
The poor are often reluctant to be referred because they are afraid of the additional costs that are not covered by PT Askes
Moreover, for some patients, the transportation costs to reach the hospital are also too high
The patients who are referred to the hospital have to bring their Askes-Gakin card and the referral letter from the puskesmas together with one photocopy of each document
The head of Puskesmas Marga I complained about the Askes referral forms
According to him, the form is exactly the same as the referral form for the Askes non-Gakin patient and only available in limited numbers
Furthermore, in his opinion, PT Askes is too bureaucratic regarding the referral letter from the puskesmas
There have been emergency cases where the patients were brought directly to the RSUD (such as accidents)
It should not be necessary to “formally” refer such patients from a puskesmas as it is very obvious that a puskesmas cannot treat such serious illnesses/injuries
In practice, the hospital still asked for the referral letter from the puskesmas so that the patient's relatives had to return to the puskesmas for the sole purpose of obtaining that letter
In his view, this is unnecessary and inefficient
When a response was sought from the DinKes Tabanan on this problem, they agreed that emergency cases indeed do not need to be referred by puskesmas
Chronic cases only need to be referred once in six months
The DinKes seems to be aware of the problem and have communicated their concerns to several staff members and doctors of the hospital
They worry however, that the hospital staff do not communicate the complaints with each other
The hospital staff – especially those who are at the front desk and in charge of checking the formalities – tend to be more rigid as they seek to avoid administration mistakes
Medicine for the poor All health care providers (PPK I and II) mentioned that the medicines that are meant for the poor differ from the medicines for the non-poor
Puskesmas do not have to apply for medicines for the Askes-Gakin patients
The medicines are provided to puskesmas as one package from the DinKes
The sorts and amount of medicines received by a puskesmas are decided by the DinKes and is (theoretically) based on the specific need of each puskesmas (the main health problems of the poor in the given puskesmas)
In Puskesmas Penebel I, for instance, the medicines for Askes-Gakin were provided in May-June 2004
The health care providers also have to report the usage of these medicines separately from the medicines used by the non-Gakin
The medicines that are available for the poor are even more limited than the “normal” spectrum of medicines available at the puskesmas
This can have serious consequences and is a major limit on the quality of care that the poor can receive
Monitoring Mechanisms and Coordination among the Stakeholders Monitoring mechanisms between DinKes and the different health care providers exist but are limited to monthly financial expenditure and utilization of health care services reports
The PPK I/puskesmas is obliged to provide monthly (financial) reports to the DinKes, but on the other hand the PPK II/RSUD does not have this obligation and can provide its financial report directly to PT Askes
This different monitoring system undermines the function of DinKes as “the supervisor and coordinator” of the health insurance system for the poor
For the DinKes it is very difficult to get the information regarding health care services at the hospital after the initiation of the Askes-Gakin
According to the DinKes, this is a “political matter” (although they did not explain exactly what this means) and because the BRSU considers itself at the same level with the DinKes
The report of the hospital to PT Askes includes
1
the number of in-patients (Rawat Inap); 2
the number of outpatients (Rawat Jalan); 3
the costs of special treatment (Tindakan Khusus); and 4
the total expenditures
It can be said that the existing monitoring mechanisms are only financial monitoring ones
As is the case with other studies (Cilegon and Purbalingga), the DinKes of Tabanan also referred to a “Community Complaints Unit”' (“Unit Pengaduan Masyarakat”) whose role is to record complaints on the health services
In Tabanan, this UPM, which is located at the DinKes, supposedly consists of five people from DinKes and the local government
Nevertheless, this cannot be seen as a sufficient mechanism to control the quality of services because the UPM does not have a clear policy and authority
According to PT Askes, there is coordination among DinKes, PT Askes and the providers of health services
Each “case” (of complaint) would be handled separately by this coordinating team but they do not meet regularly
Furthermore, PT Askes also has a 24-hour “hotline service” for complaints and enquiries
This kind of vague monitoring mechanism and coordination are similar to other cases (Purbalingga and Cilegon)
DinKes Tabanan also admitted that they still need to develop a more effective control mechanism for the Askes–Gakin scheme
Until now DinKes, as the supervisor of the scheme, only received reports e.g on implementation problems from the health providers and PT Askes
In the near future, DinKes plans to carry out a study on the implementation of Askes- Gakin, but they are not sure whether they have enough staff to carry out this task
IV
EXPERIENCES FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES A
THE PUSKESMAS 
In general, the heads of both puskemas (as well as the puskesmas visited by the research team in Cilegon and Purbalingga districts) mentioned that from the puskesmas' point of view, the JPK-Gakin system is better than the previous health financing mechanism
There are two main arguments for this observation
First of all, the new system relieves the puskesmas of the burden of being responsible for the identification of the poor and issuance of the gakin card
In the health card system, the head of the puskesmas had to sign the cards and was therefore seen as the main person in the selection of gakin
People complained or were even angry with the puskesmas staff if they were not assessed as eligible to receive free health services
In the new system if there are protests from those who are not entitled to the card, the puskesmas head can suggest to them that they look for information at the DinKes or PT Askes office (or the Bapel, in other districts)
Secondly, the Bapel is responsible for the administration that comes with the processing of the members eligible for health insurance
This saves the puskesmas from a large burden of administrative work
This investigation also found that the puskesmas are content with the current system because, in general, the capitation is more than enough for the puskesmas to cover the health cost of the poor and thus no additional burden is put on the puskesmas' work load
Penebel I Puskesmas Penebel I is located at Pitra village, Kecamatan Penebel, which has 27,572 inhabitants
This puskesmas has two doctors, one dentist, 12 midwives (bidan) and seven pustu
The Penebel I serves inhabitants of nine surrounding villages
There are 4,307 people eligible for the Askes-Gakin health insurance scheme, this makes up 15.6 % of Tabanan's population
According to the midwife at Pustu Senganan, which belongs to Puskesmas Penebel I, all gakin in her pustu have received the Askes-Gakin card
Nevertheless, Penebel I also provides services to patients who have other types of health insurance (Askes scheme)
The JPK-Gakin capitation is based on the number of poor in the region served by the puskesmas and will be allocated according to the decree issued by the head of DinKes Tabanan
Based on the decree, the distribution of the Rp51.7 million allocation is
As the tables show, most of the capitation is allocated for costs related to the functions of different stakeholders (fee for management, supervision, coordination, provision of health care)
From the interviews, it seems that some of these functions – such as supervision and coordination – are quite unclear
If the fees are considered as an incentive for stakeholders to improve their performance and services, the effectiveness of this incentive is questionable
In 2004, the poor visited the puskesmas approximately 1,656 times
Based on this, we can calculate that the health care cost of Penebel I for the gakin patients would be Rp4,140,000
As Penebel I is entitled to a Rp51.7 million subsidy per year, the health care cost in 2004 was only 8.0% of the subsidy
Apart from the capitation of Askes-Gakin, Penebel I receives income from other sources namely
reimbursement from other Askes schemes, the operational and regular funds from APBD and income from patient contributions (Rp2,500/visit)
The puskesmas head complained that the income from other sources has declined, therefore the capitation of Askes-Gakin is very helpful in preventing a more disadvantageous financial condition
From the data on new visits at the Puskesmas Penebel I in 2003 and 2004, it can be concluded that the utilization of puskesmas services (not including pustu and polindes) by the non-gakin patients is higher than the gakin patients
According to the puskesmas head, the barrier for many gakin to get the free health services they are entitled to is the transportation cost to reach the puskesmas
This is especially the case for those who live relatively far from the health center
The puskesmas pembantu (pustu), which is located in almost each village, is therefore more accessible for the gakin patients
In 2004 the utilization of puskesmas services by the gakin was slightly lower than in 2003
The puskesmas head said that the hospital never rejected the referral from Penebel I
The puskesmas only sent patients to the hospital if they cannot be treated in the puskesmas, for example in cases of childbirth with complications and cardio-vascular diseases
In 2004 Penebel I referred fewer patients to the Tabanan hospital than in 2003
Furthermore, the number of Gakin patients referred both in 2003 as well as in 2004 was much lower than for the non-Gakin patients
Marga I Puskesmas Marga I is located in Kuwum village, Kecamatan Marga which had 22,544 inhabitants in 2003 and 22,569 in 2004
This puskesmas has six pustu
The Marga I serves inhabitants of six surrounding villages
The number of gakin, who are entitled to free health services in this puskesmas, is 3,308; all of them are insured by the JPK-Gakin Scheme
Like Penebel I, Puskesmas Marga I also provides services to patients who have other types of health insurance (Askes scheme)
Utilization at the Marga I in 2004 was 1,482
Based on this, we can calculate that the health care cost of Marga I was Rp3,705,000
As Marga I is entitled to Rp39,696,000 million subsidy per year, the health care cost in 2003 was only 9.3 % of the subsidy
Furthermore, the JPK-Gakin capitation, to which each puskesmas is entitled, will be allocated according to the decree issued by the head of DinKes Tabanan
Based on the decree, the distribution of the allocation of Rp39.7 million is
Marga I receives income from similar sources to Penebel I, namely
Askes-Gakin capitation, reimbursement of other Askes schemes, the operational and regular funds from APBD and income from patient contributions (Rp.2,500/visit)
The head of Marga I also complained about the reduction in puskesmas income, especially the operational and regular funds from the DinKes Tabanan
From the data on new visits at the Puskesmas Marga I and the pustu in 2003 and 2004, this investigation also found a similar trend to Penebel I; namely the utilization of puskesmas services by the non-Gakin patients is much higher than the Gakin patients
Nevertheless, because the visits at the pustu were also included, the utilization of gakin patients is obviously higher than in Penebel I
As was mentioned above, those who live far from the puskesmas usually prefer to go to the pustu that is located in almost every village
Unlike the case with Puskesmas Penebel I, the utilization of puskesmas services by the gakin in Puskesmas Marga I was slightly higher in 2004 than in 2003
Also in Marga I, only selected cases were referred to Tabanan hospital
These included major injuries, childbirth with complications and health problems that need more specialized treatments (mostly ophthalmological problems)
As is the case with Puskesmas Penebel I, the referral rate for Gakin patients is much lower than for non-Gakin patients
According to the head of Puskesmas Marga I, the reason for the low referral rate is mostly because Gakin patients are afraid that they will probably have to pay additional costs for treatment at the hospital
He also said that it is unfair for the poor patients who are not utilizing their rights only because they are not well informed by PT Askes about the treatments and medicines they are entitled to
When we asked him what information the puskesmas provided the Gakin patients about their rights, he admitted that he also did not know what exactly was included in the benefit package of PT Askes
Information on the benefit package (the services the poor are entitled to receive at the puskesmas and hospitals), treatments that are not covered by PT Askes and the procedure to get the health services is actually in the formal agreement between PT Askes and DinKes Tabanan
PT Askes also has booklets – available at the Denpasar office - and from their website that provide information on their products
These are, however, not an accessible medium of communication for the Gakin clients
B
THE HOSPITAL 
Badan Rumah Sakit Umum (BRSU) “Rumah Kita” Tabanan The BRSU “Rumah Kita” Tabanan is a public hospital and the only hospital in the district
This hospital has a total of 578 staff; including 52 doctors (24 specialized doctors)
The hospital manages its own financial resources and only receives a limited subsidy from the APBD
This subsidy is allocated for the salary of hospital staff who are civil servants (287 people or almost 50% of the staff)
The hospital building is a facility also provided by the local government
The purchase of medicines and medical instruments and the salaries of non-civil servant staff are independently financed
According to the management, most of the hospital tariffs are still provided at below their real cost and therefore they still struggle with a deficit
The hospital is also able to borrow money from individuals in case of necessity but have not been able to identify the individuals in order to obtain a better idea of the incentive structure behind this lending process
About Rp1.8 billion (80%) of the JPK-Gakin funds in 2004 were allocated for the health care expenditures made by the hospital
This is one of the income sources of the hospital, but the amount is a relatively small share (8.3%) in comparison to the total income of the hospital from other sources
The hospital receives reimbursements of Askes–Gakin claims monthly
One disadvantage of a capitation system is that there is a possibility of a diminished quality of service as the provider is limited in its income
With a fee-for-service (FFS) system such an impact is not expected to occur, but an increase in the quality of services is not expected to occur with a FFS either
By implementing a financing scheme for the poor one does expect a decrease in pressure on the service provider to contain costs and thus, in comparison to a system where poor patients pay for services, this may avoid a decrease in quality
As to the effect of the financing scheme, the management of BRSU Tabanan argued that the previous health financing mechanism (Subsidi BBM – 2001) is better than the Askes–Gakin scheme (2004)
The previous mechanism totally covered the health costs while the Askes-Gakin scheme only covered services that are on the Askes list
This caused dissatisfaction among the insured
Between January – October 2004, the visit rate – both outpatients as well as in-patients - of the Gakin patients in Tabanan hospital is much lower than the non-Gakin patients
This is consistent with the very small number of Gakin patients referred by puskesmas
V
CONCLUDING REMARKS A
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS 
The major involvement of PT Askes in the management of health financing for the poor in Indonesia has been legalized since January 1st, 2005
Whilst many other districts are still in the early phases of a transition period from the Bapel system to the Askes system, Tabanan district has fully implemented a cooperative agreement with PT Askes
It was mentioned in the previous section that this choice is based on two reasons namely
the district wanted to avoid mismanagement by an inexperienced insurer and PT Askes is considered to be a professional insurance company with extended experience (more than three decades) and a wide working area
In other districts like Purbalingga and East Sumba, the local government and the DinKes have developed a management unit (the Badan Pengelola or Bapel) as the insurer
This management unit has a closer relationship with the DinKes in many respects because it is run by staff of DinKes or the district public hospital
Moreover, the office of Bapel is often located at the DinKes office (for instance in Cilegon and in East Sumba)
Consequently, in this system, DinKes - as the key supervisor of the JPK-Gakin scheme - has a stronger grip on the insurer
In the light of this, the choice to collaborate with an experienced private company like PT Askes has some consequences
The supervision and monitoring by DinKes of an insurer like PT Askes runs the risk of being less effective because PT Askes is a relatively well-established institution that is totally independent of the DinKes
Moreover, there is a difference in the level of expertise and experience between PT Askes and the DinKes regarding the management of insurance schemes
Therefore the supervision and monitoring by DinKes of PT Askes tends to be “formal” instead of “actual”
This difference in the level of expertise and experience can also be a barrier for the DinKes to negotiate the cost and coverage of the scheme with PT Askes
For example, the DinKes Tabanan admitted that they have been unsuccessful in bargaining a lower premium with PT Askes
For the new contract they also intend to negotiate a better benefit package to be provided by PT Askes
PT Askes – as the insurer – is also barely involved in the promotion and socialization of the JPK-Gakin program in Tabanan
They also did not engage in the identification of the gakin – thus, their potential clients - and only use the data compiled by DinKes Tabanan
In other words, in Tabanan, the insurer did not participate in the marketing of the scheme or in providing good information to the potential clients
In Purbalingga district, the Bapel (as the insurer) worked closely with DinKes, puskesmas, the village midwives and volunteers to identify and recruit clients
The Bapel allocated special funds and assigned staff to promote the scheme
Using DinKes' extensive network (especially the puskesmas, village midwives and volunteers) the Bapel in Purbalingga reached their clients down to the neighbourhood level
As a result, it appears that clients in Purbalingga are better informed and have a closer relationship with the insurer than is the case in Tabanan
B
THE EFFECTS ON THE PROVISION OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES 
The poor (as the clients) of the JPK-Gakin scheme – both in Bapel as well as the Askes system - have the strongest interest in the provision of good quality health care services
They cannot, however, utilize their purchasing power to affect the quality of services as the scheme is fully funded by the central and local government
In this paradigm, the DinKes is responsible for articulating and protecting the interest of the poor
With regard to the barriers mentioned before however, DinKes is not the most effective institution to carry out these tasks
The capitation for the primary health care provider (the puskesmas) can be a suitable system to contain cost although in this system there is the possibility that the quality of services will be reduced in the pursuit of lower costs
Nevertheless, containing costs is an important issue for puskesmas as the capitation they received is more than adequate
The question will be whether adequate capitation fees will stimulate a better service
Obviously, the JPK-Gakin scheme can secure primary health care for the poor, but this does not necessarily mean that the poor will receive good quality of care
In general, the health care at the puskesmas is quite limited both in terms of quality and variety
The implementation of the JPK-Gakin scheme – including adequate capitation for puskesmas from this scheme - would certainly not change this condition easily as the condition relates to more complex factors such as the availability of good medical staff, instruments and facilities
Regarding the fact that the capitation is quite strictly allocated for certain costs (e.g
various fees for the stakeholders) so that the puskesmas cannot easily use the unspent funds for other purposes (e.g
to improve clean water system, the building etc.)
it can be said that adequate capitation fees do not really empower puskesmas to solve the problems they have
The fee-for-service system for the secondary and tertiary health care providers does not provide the motivation to contain the costs either
Furthermore, it does not necessarily increase the quality of services
The most positive effect of the JPK-Gakin scheme on the provision of health care for the poor is the possibility to get secondary and tertiary health care that is usually unaffordable for the poor
Nevertheless, for a range of different reasons, the majority of Gakin patients are not referred to the hospital
There are cases where the Gakin patients refused to be referred to the hospital although it was necessary because they were insecure about the additional costs that were not covered by PT Askes
They were also not well informed about the benefit package
At this point we can conclude that although the JPK-Gakin scheme does secure the right of the poor to get medical treatment at the hospital, it cannot secure the actualization of it
To push the actualization, the poor should at least be better informed about what treatments they are entitled to so that they do not forego the required treatment only because they are insecure about the financial consequences
Most importantly, the benefit package needs to be improved in order to reduce the co-payment required by the Gakin patients
Making Services Work for the Poor in Indonesia
A Report on Health Financing Mechanisms in Kabupaten Purbalingga, Central Java
A Case Study
ABSTRACT 
Purbalingga is the first kabupaten in Indonesia to start implementing its health insurance scheme for the poor, as a replacement for the JPS-BK scheme (Social Safety Net Program – Health Sector)
Poor families (Gakin) receive a range of health insurance services that are subsidized by the government free-of-charge, while better-off families pay a premium of only 50% or 100%
They are categorized as participants in Gakin Levels I, II and III
The aim is to achieve universal coverage for all citizens in Kabupaten Purbalingga, those who are poor as well as those who are not
Kabupaten Purbalingga is considered unique in the scope of its health services, because it not only includes poor families in its scheme, but also non-poor families
The local government of Kabupaten Purbalingga considers the health insurance scheme to be one of the main pillars of the poverty reduction effort in the region
They want the management of this scheme to become more independent and less dependent on DinKes (the local government health agency) so the program can be managed more efficiently and with more accountability
What is rather interesting is that DinKes plans to arrange a health insurance scheme that will be autonomous and sustainable for all better-off members in the future
They intend to slowly increase the premium until it reaches the real cost of the assistance package
According to DinKes, the cost should be approximately Rp92,000 per family per month
From the perspective of Bapel, an autonomous scheme with that level of premium definitely has potential, however they will always depend on the premiums to be paid by the government
It needs to be noted that the Community Health Insurance Scheme (JPKM) initiative in Kabupaten Purbalingga is almost entirely the initiative of the government as its moving force
The main protagonists are government (Regent, DinKes and Bapel), public service providers (public hospitals and puskesmas), the local parliament (DPRD) and other government agencies

OVERVIEW A
THE JPK-GAKIN SCHEME IN PURBALINGGA 
The JPKM Scheme in Purbalingga is managed by a Management Agency (Bapel), named PT Sadar Sehat Mandiri
The Bapel was established by the Bupati Decree No
40/63 in 2003, effective April 7, 2003
The scheme has, however, been operational since the 2001/2002 fiscal year, since the Purbalingga government considered it important to firstly establish a scheme and worry about its implementing regulations later
Purbalingga chooses to have a separate Bapel managing its JPKM scheme because it wants the scheme's management to be independent of the government health office (Dinas Kesehatan or DinKes), so that the program can be managed more efficiently and accountably
Purbalingga is considered to be unique in its health care coverage, because it not includes poor (gakin) families in its scheme, but also includes non-gakin families as well
Gakin clients receive their insurance coverage free of charge (subsidized by the government), while non-poor families pay a premium of either 50% or 100% of the full rate (see below for details)
The aim of the program is to achieve universal coverage for the entire population of the Purbalingga District, both those who are poor (who formerly received the JPS-BK subsidies) and those who are non-poor
The Bapel in Purbalingga provides three benefit packages that are very similar, if people want to join they are eligible for a benefit package with a corresponding premium based on their income
Participants of the JPKM scheme were divided into three categories based on their income
Strata I
poor families (keluarga miskin-Gakin)
free of charge
Usually Gakin/Strata I members work as casual laborers or landless farmers
Strata II
families that used to be poor (keluarga pasca-Gakin)
income levels and living situation just above miskin
pay 50% of the full premium (currently Rp25,000)
These are generally the informal workers such as ojek and becak drivers
Strata III
non-poor/rich families (keluarga non-Gakin)
the “wealthy”/those who can pay the full amount of the premium (currently Rp50,000)
Kaders, (local volunteers) only pay 50% of the premium but receive the Strata III benefit package
The kaders play a central role in the provisioning and functioning of the scheme in Purbalingga, their role will be expanded upon later in this report
In general, Strata III members are midsize or large retail merchants
Health providers in Purbalingga that accept JPKM members as patients are categorized as the following
Provider Class I (PPK I)
public health center (puskesmas), and village midwife (bidan desa)
All JPKM members are expected to seek their health care from the puskesmas first
Provider Class II (PPK II)
District Public Hospital (Rumah Sakit Umum Daerah- RSUD)
It receives JPKM patients that were referred by the Puskesmas
Provider Class III (PPK III)
Provincial Public Hospital (Rumah Sakit Umum Provinsi- RSUP)
This only applies for Gakin/Strata I 
Clients Strata II and III could not be referred outside of Purbalingga
There are two RSUP in the Central Java Province
RSUP Karyadi in Semarang and RSUP Margono in Purwokerto, only 30 kilometers from the Purbalingga District
It should be noted that these providers are public/state owned providers only
Private providers are unable (or unwilling) to become JPKM providers, due to the perceived inadequacy of reimbursements under the scheme
II
SCHEME
FUNCTIONAL A
POLITICAL ECONOMY
WHO INITIATED
The health insurance scheme in Purbalingga had its roots in the 1998 economic crisis, as part of the Indonesian Government's Social Safety Net Scheme for the Health Sector (JPS-BK)
Even though this program was discontinued by the central government in 2000, the local government realized that many of its beneficiaries continue to need support to access health care services
Therefore, the Purbalingga District Government decided to continue an adapted version of the program in 2000, and renamed it as the Health Insurance Scheme for Poor Families (JPK-Gakin)
The program then was expanded into a Community Health Insurance Scheme (JPKM), that is open to all citizens in fiscal year 2001/2002
Purbalingga was the first district in Indonesia to install its own health insurance program for the poor as a replacement for the JPS-BK scheme within its district and the stakeholders involved seem to be highly motivated to make this scheme work
According to the Head of the Bapel, the initiative to create this health insurance is based on the view that during the previous JPS-BK scheme, the subsidies were spent with little accountability and little regard for the program's future sustainability
Health insurance scheme like this is assumed to be able to address these problems
The reason for providing three benefit packages for people of different incomes is to increase access to health care and utilization of health care services for all people in Purbalingga's society
The Purbalingga government considers the health insurance scheme as one of the major pillars of the government's poverty reduction efforts in the district
The scheme allows access not only for the poorest of their society, but also provides an option for people with other income levels in need of health insurance
These targets have been written down in the “Healthy Indonesia 2010” program formulated by the Ministry of Health
The idea that was adopted by the Purbalingga government was for it to develop a health insurance scheme with the aim of achieving universal coverage for the entire population of the Purbalingga District
Therefore, the Purbalingga government decided to provide three different packages depending on people's income, both those who are poor (who formerly received the JPS-BK subsidies) and those who are non-poor
Interestingly enough, the DinKes plans to make the health insurance scheme selfsustainable for the non-gakin members in the future
They intend to slowly increase the premium until it reaches the real price of the benefit package
According to the DinKes that price should be around Rp92,000 per family per month
From Bapel's perspective a selfsustaining scheme at that premium level is possible, but they will always depend on the premium paid for the poor by the government
As the head of the Bapel in Purbalingga puts it, It is the task for the government to provide health care for the poor so they will continue to provide funds to do so.” If they had to rely on a cross-subsidy from the Strata III insured for both the Strata II and the Strata I insured they will be over-reliant on the premium of Strata III insured and the burden on their contribution would be too high
It should be noted that the JPKM insurance initiative in Purbalingga is almost entirely a government-driven initiative, with the main actors being the government (the Bupati, DinKes, Bapel), public providers (RSUD and puskesmas), local Parliament (DPRD), and other governmental agencies
Other stakeholders (the community, private sector, NGOs, etc.) do not have much role in shaping this policy initiative
Their role thus far is only as members/clients of the scheme, paying its premiums and receiving its benefits, if they are willing to do so
B
JPKM FINANCING IN PURBALINGGA 
The premium for the health insurance scheme is set by the Bapel with feedback from the health care providers
When the program was set up in 2001, the premium for Strata II and III was set at Rp30,000 per family per year with full payment for the third strata and half payment for the second strata
The premium was raised to its current level (Rp25,000 per family per year for Strata II and Rp50,000 for Strata III) in 2003
Since the 2004 financial year, the insurance premium has been set at Rp50,000/household/year
Apart from private contributions, the main portion of revenue comes from the subsidies of both central as well as local government
In Fiscal Year 2002/2003, over 70% of the revenues originated from government subsidies
These subsidies almost tripled in the following year as shown in Table 1 below
Theoretically, each strata has different revenue sources
Strata I
all funding comes from the general block grant (Dana Alokasi Umum- DAU) and fuel compensation subsidies for poor families (PKPS-BBM)
Strata II
half of the funding comes from members' premiums and the other half is from subsidies coming from similar sources as Strata I
Strata III
all funding comes from members' own premiums (self-funded)
Both Bapel and the health provider (RSUD) stated that at this time however, the amount of funds allocated to subsidize Gakin/Strata I members far exceeded the funds collected from Strata II and III members and that the premium is not sufficient to fully cover the cost of health services for these members
This allows members and society to get used to the principles of (health) insurance and increases their willingness to pay for a health scheme
The Bapel head said that this premium is only an “introductory premium” 
It is planned that this introductory premium will be increased gradually until it reaches the real premium rate around the year 2012
By that time, the scheme is supposed to become self-sufficient, without the need for government subsidies to cover its financial shortfalls
Both first line treatment and specialized care (puskesmas and hospital) are reimbursed through a capitation payment
Communication between the different stakeholders regarding the payment is regular, but there is more correspondence between hospital and Bapel than puskesmas and Bapel
This may be because the ties between the hospital and the Bapel are stronger as doctors in the hospital are also employed in the Bapel
The capitation payment for outpatients receiving highly subsidized puskesmas care is, by definition, the smallest subsidy received
The puskesmas receives Rp20,000 per family per year
Interestingly enough puskesmas and the hospital almost receive the same capitation payment although the reimbursement for in-patient treatment at the puskesmas is higher than the hospital
Over the past three years the capitation payment for the RSUD has doubled as the capitation set in previous years proved to be insufficient (see Table 3 below)
After consultations between the different stakeholders the capitation rate has been significantly increased
The staff of the RSUD find it difficult to predict whether this years' capitation will be enough
They expect this years' expenditures to be closer to the capitation payment
But this will not reduce the deficit they accrued over previous years
C
BENEFIT PACKAGE In principle, insurance members receive their primary health care first
They are entitled to receive all necessary medical services that are available at a puskesmas
It should be noted however, that the types of service and medication actually available at puskesmas are relatively limited, although both puskesmas and DinKes staff (and also several patients/clients interviewed, especially those who are also kaders) stated that, since the JPKM commenced operations, the quality of services of puskesmas have increased, as a result, many JPKM members require referral to the RSUD
For Gakin/Strata I members, there are no restrictions on the types of treatment they can receive at the RSUD
For Strata II and Strata III members however, there are some limitations, including
in-patient treatments are limited to a maximum of 10 days; the type of medication being used; laboratory expenditures are limited to a maximum of Rp15,000; and X-ray expenditures are limited to a maximum of Rp25,000
If Strata II and III health expenditures exceed these limits, the patient has to pay the entire cost above these limits (a co-payment)
If insurance members cannot pay the entire amount at once, they can pay them by installment
In addition, officially there is a rule stating that some health services will not be covered for insurance members 
However, it is unclear whether this rule is actually being enforced by health providers
Health providers seem to make exceptions to this rule in the case of Gakin/Strata I members
An RSUD staff stated that “all Gakin members will receive all necessary treatments required for their health care, regardless of costs.” The rights of JPKM members to receive health services in puskesmas and RSUD are specified in Appendix 1
D
THE ROLE OF KADERS IN MARKETING AND IDENTIFYING JPKM MEMBERS 
The identification and verification of the poor is an important and difficult step in providing health care for the poor
During the period of the health card (JPS-BK), identification of the poor was a major problem
If the poor are not aware of their rights they cannot make use of the health insurance and therefore publicizing the program is of crucial importance
For the identification and verification of the poor, and the socialization (or marketing) of the program, the Purbalingga District makes use of a Tim Desa
This team consists of the puskesmas, bidan and the village head (kepala desa)
A large role in the marketing and socialization of JPKM is played by members of the Family Welfare Program (PKK) who are commonly called kaders
Typical kaders are the wives of the local Household Association (RT) Head or the wives of an important member of the community, such as a teacher, a religious leader (ulama) or a civil servant
Kaders operate among the grassroots of the community and there is at least one kader in each RT
They are involved in the socialization efforts of various other government programs, ranging from child immunization (posyandu) to farm planting methods
Since kaders live among the community, they know many of the community members living near them quite well
Thus, it is easy for them to approach community members and publicize a given government program
At the same time, community members are more likely to consider information received from kaders more seriously than that communicated by government officials, who often do not live in the community and have more distant and impersonal relationships with community members compared with kaders
Kaders are probably the most effective tools used by the district government to market the JPKM scheme, given that they know the surrounding community closely and are perceived to be a more reliable information source than formal government bureaucracy
As a result, the success of JPKM largely depends on the marketing methods of kaders and their skills in promoting and marketing it
Even when these efforts were also conducted by Bapel through other means, it is through the kader system that most of the marketing and socialization efforts to recruit new JPKM members are centered
They are the ones who explain to the community what the JPKM scheme is all about and why citizens should join it as well as recruit JPKM members in their living/working area
These activities are done both through formal community members and informal communications with fellow community members when conducting routine daily activities
Kaders normally do this work on a voluntary basis
They only receive a small amount of incentive payment (around Rp1,000 per member signed up) in return for their marketing and socialization efforts
Thus, the financial cost of using the kader system in marketing the program was minimal
The recruitment and validation of JPKM members is done once per year, between the months of June and July
It is especially targeted to identify those families who have increased their wealth and are moving from Strata I to Strata II
Kaders are supposed to follow a list of predetermined names of community members given to them by the Bapel and puskesmas
However, even when they claimed that they follow this list in identifying prospective members, in practice they have great influence and discretion in categorizing prospective members living in their community, especially in determining who is Gakin (Strata I) and who is post-Gakin (Strata II)
According to kaders who were interviewed, in determining those who move from Gakin to post-Gakin status, they normally used the condition of the family's house as a primary criteria (for instance, whether the house had a dirt or marble floor) or enquired about whether members of the household have managed to improve their earnings (e.g those who were unemployed are now working)
When kaders made these modifications in the prospective members' list, they were usually not challenged by the Bapel and the puskesmas
Thus, the influence of kaders in determining JPKM's membership status is quite substantial
At the same time, there is considerable pressure from Bapel to increase the number of premium paying members (especially at Strata II level) and reduce the number of nonpaying Gakin/Strata I members in the JPKM membership roll
Thus, kaders are pressured to “upgrade” the Gakin members in their community to Strata II status, even when these members are still technically a Gakin
Consequently, these former Gakin members are no longer eligible to receive health services without paying a premium of Rp25,000/KK/year to continue receiving these services
Even though the kaders can more easily identify the category of wealth a household belongs to, they are also subject to complaints
Sometimes family members do not accept their assigned “status” and complain
In this case kaders have to convince the families that they can no longer be identified as Gakin
As the kader is close they can put social pressure on them, which can be a risk in correct identification of the real poor
Another means by which community members were enticed to join the JPKM scheme was by increasing puskesmas' user fees from Rp2,000/person/visit before the 2003/2004 financial year to about Rp5,500/person/visit today
The fee is waived for JPKM members, but is charged for non-members
Bapel and puskesmas officials stated that this would serve as an incentive for citizens to enroll in the JPKM scheme, since they do not have to pay the puskesmas user fee if they are enrolled in it
Lastly, Purbalingga District's civil servants and kaders were pressured to enroll in the JPKM scheme at Strata III level, in order to, according to a DinKes staff, “assure the success of this government program.” The civil servants have to pay the full cost of Strata III themselves, while the kaders receive a 50% discount (Rp25,000/KK) if they enroll in the scheme
There are several factors that determine the number of community members participating in JPKM
1
Members joining Strata I and II are influenced by the marketing methods and ability of local activists to promote the scheme at community level (kaders, midwives, and RT head)
The marketing methods, skills, and motivation of kaders largely influences whether or not people will enroll in the scheme
In RTs where the kaders are highly motivated and active, people are more likely to be enrolled in the scheme, whereas this is not the case in RTs where the kader play a more subdued role
2
Members joining Strata III are influenced by conventional promotion and marketing efforts conducted by Bapels (by putting up flyers, radio and newspaper ads, distributing leaflets) and other methods such as using “social pressure” to persuade civil servants and kaders to enroll at Strata III level
3
The ability of the community to receive and understand information given to them
This may be related to the level of their education
4
Community perception of puskesmas services (facilities available, service quality, effectiveness of medication/drugs, etc.)
Compared with the JPK-Gakin in other districts/cities (e.g in Tabanan and East Sumba), there seems to be more awareness from members/citizens about the JPKM scheme and their rights as members of the scheme (e.g in general they know that with Gakin card, they could obtain free health services at puskesmas/RSUD)
This should be attributed to the aggressive socialization campaign by kaders at the RT level, the training by the puskesmas and knowledge of the kaders about the program itself
This awareness does not necessarily mean however, that more citizens would become members of the scheme
Many are still refusing to join the scheme
In some RTs, up to 50% of residents are not JPKM members
Reasons given for not joining the program included
1) they do not have the money to pay the JPKM premium (for Strata II and III members), 
2) they are skeptical about whether they would actually receive the services promised by JPKM (without additional “payments/tips” to doctors/paramedics, 
3) they believe that the quality of health care services provided by puskesmas/RSUD are inferior to those of private providers, even while they are not reimbursed by the JPKM scheme, and 
4) they already have another health insurance package that is more attractive
E
UTILIZATION AND REFERRAL 
A comparison of utilization rates of health care services between insured and non-insured and between the different strata indicates a difference in behavior regarding accessing health care services
The average monthly utilization rate of JPKM members in Purbalingga during fiscal year 2003/2004 is described in Tabel 4 below
For Gakin/Strata I members, the average monthly utilization statistics are as follows
While Strata I members contribute more than 50% of the total insured, they only use slightly over 20% of the puskesmas health services (see Tabel 6)
Assuming that the health of people of different income groups is the same they will have a similar pattern of need
This need does not however, seem to be satisfied by the puskesmas health care services
For hospital services this discrepancy is even larger
Only 12.37% of JPKM members using hospital care were Gakin
This indicates that there are other barriers than financing of the health care services that limit access to health care services by Gakin
One possible barrier, identified by the Head of Puskesmas Kutasari, is the cost of transportation for poor citizens (Gakin) from their homes to the puskesmas
Even when they receive free treatment at the puskesmas, they often have to use public transportation or a relatively expensive motorbike taxi (ojek)
The transportation cost is often much higher than the puskesmas' user fee
There is also the opportunity cost in attending the puskesmas that puts additional pressure on someone's budget
This problem was raised by the puskesmas head we interviewed in Cilegon
Another problem contributing to the low utilization rate of puskesmas by Gakin/Strata I members is a community perception that the quality of health services in puskesmas is poor or people's unwillingness to use conventional health treatment for their health care
Some members/clients we interviewed stated that they prefer to use private providers, such as the one provided by paramedics (mantri), traditional healers, etc
These providers are often puskesmas staff who happen to live in the community where the clients live
They have often consulted these providers for their health care needs for many years, even decades
Thus, they feel a more personal relationship with these providers compared with other providers at a puskesmas
This is why they continue to use the service of these providers even when they charge much higher fees (sometimes the cost is up to 20 times more) compared with the puskesmas fees
Finally, some puskesmas staff said that some patients (especially Gakin) are not willing to go to puskesmas/RSUD until their illness has become more serious
They attributed this to “cultural” issues (afraid of seeing formal health providers, etc)
In addition, many Strata I members have not received their JPKM membership card
The card they have is still the old health social safety net (JPS-BK) card
Many Gakin members without the new card were reluctant to seek treatment at puskesmas, fearing that they would be refused treatment if they do not have the new card
In comparison, most Strata II and III members have already received their JPKM card
Thus, there is an indication that Bapel and the puskesmas prioritize the distribution of the card for premium-paying members instead of those who are Gakin
This might discourage Gakin members from using the health services available at puskesmas and RSUD
Thus, delaying the distribution of membership cards to Gakin serves as an informal rationing mechanism for reducing Gakin's utilization of health services
There is also a large difference in referral of gakin and non-gakin members; fewer than 15% of the total referrals are for gakin patients
We have to observe this outcome from different perspectives to understand what has caused this outcome
From the patients' perspective, it seems that not everybody is willing to go to hospital due to the long distance, length of time and costs that it would take to get there
From the hospital's perspective
there have been complaints from the hospital that the puskesmas initially referred too many cases that could actually be treated by puskesmas
The policy that referrals should be signed by puskesmas' doctors was made because the RSUD complains that earlier, puskesmas referred too many patients to RSUD, often for cases which could have been treated by puskesmas
This resulted in the RSUD having to cope with a high number of new patients that also incurred higher health care expenditures
According to RSUD, most of these improper referrals were given by paramedics (mantri), so the diagnosis behind the referrals was also unclear
RSUD's complaints have resulted in a lower level of referrals from puskesmas since 2004
Thus, the reasons why Gakin/Strata I utilizations were lower than other JPKM members could be attributed to the formal and informal rationing mechanism mentioned above
Since most of the health service users at puskesmas and RSUD were Strata II and III members, but most of the funding for JPKM (from BBM subsidies and DAU grants) were supposed to subsidize the health coverage for Gakin members
This means that a large portion of these funds were actually used for subsidizing the health services for better-off JPKM members
This might not be the most efficient way to provide health coverage for Purbalingga citizens
Since most of its intended target never utilize the service and those that actually use it might actually be able to fund most if not all of their own health expenditures
F
MONITORING AND COORDINATION OF STAKEHOLDERS 
The JPKM Advisory Board consists of government officials from different district government's departments/agencies and also from different sub-departments within the DinKes
There are 16 different agencies that are members of this Board, one of whom is DinKes
The Board has three functions
1
Monitoring and guidance
visiting Bapel (although there are no permanent and routine scheduled visits), receiving complaints from the community/JPKM members; 2
Development
especially developing regulations for the JPKM scheme; and 3
Advisory
directed towards the three JPKM stakeholders
Bapel, health providers, and members (through kaders)
In financial matters, monitoring is supposed to be done by the District Auditing Board (Badan Pengawas Daerah-Bawasda)
The monitoring by Bapel of the quality of health services of the puskesmas and RSUD is done by the reporting of puskesmas and RSUD's financial and expenditure data to Bapel
Formally, DinKes as part of the Advisory Board of JPKM, is responsible for monitoring the work of the Bapel, the effect of JPK-Gakin on utilization and quality (based on the DepKes book)
Monitoring of the Bapel is performed by measuring the utilization of health care services and the health expenditure costs
Health care providers (puskesmas, pustu, and hospital) all provide monthly reports on utilization rates and expenditures to the DinKes
However, this kind of monitoring is rather limited and does not provide information concerning why people do or do not make use of health care services if they need it
Also, quality assessments of health care services are not done
There also appears to be little coordination between involved parties (DinKes, Bapel, and providers) in monitoring the use and the finances of JPKM
Specifically, it is unclear whether the financial and utilization reports submitted by health providers were checked and verified by other government agencies (DinKes and Bapel)
Within these two agencies, there is no agreement on which one should verify these reports
Strata II and III members are more likely to complain about services they received at puskesmas/RSUD
On the other hand, there are very few complaints being lodged by Gakin/Strata I members
Bapel and health service providers attributed this to the lack of education of Gakin compared with the other two strata 
As well as a tendency to “just accept fate” (nrimo/pasrah) that made them unwilling to complain to healthcare providers/Bapel about the services they received
It is also likely that the fact Strata II and III members are paying for their JPKM membership, while Gakin/Strata I members do not pay anything, also contributes to more complaints being filed by the former groups than the latter
Strata II and III members demand better services from the healthcare providers because they have paid the JPKM premium (so they feel “entitled” to receive services commensurate with the amount of premiums they have paid), while Gakin members do not care much about the quality of services of JPKM providers since they do not pay the premium
Measuring the level of satisfaction with health care services, especially when they are provided for free, is very difficult
When services are provided for free there is less likelihood that the clients will complain about those services
In addition, the assessment capabilities of a society with a low knowledge of health and health care is not a good benchmark
One option to filter complaints is at the community level through the kader, but such a system does not seem to have developed here
III
THE IMPACT OF JPKM ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY IN PURBALINGGA DISTRICT A 
OBSERVATIONS 
Although health insurance takes away the risk of having to pay for health care and thus increases the affordability of health care, there are several characteristics of this health insurance scheme that may limit access to health services by the poor
We cannot compare the utilization rate before the implementation of JPKM with the rate after implementation, but from a comparison of utilization rates with puskesmas services in other regions it is obvious that the utilization rate is much higher in Purbalingga than in other regions evaluated
Attention also needs to be paid to the following
1) The distribution of the JPKM card to members of different strata takes longer for Strata I members than for the paying members
This seems to be a general problem that also occurred in previous years
Gakin/Strata I members interviewed for this study are still using their old JPKM card because their new card has not been distributed
On the other hand the cards for Strata II and III members have been distributed
The lack of a new card could serve as a barrier for members (especially Gakin) that would make them reluctant to seek treatment at the health facilities
2) The transportation cost, especially if it is costly, which discourages the poor from going to the puskesmas and/or RSUD, even if they are JPK-Gakin members, since they could not afford the transport cost
3) Perception/stereotype of puskesmas
there is a common perception among community members that health services in puskesmas are of low quality (e.g services offered by doctors/paramedics, quality of medicine, supplementary services such as laboratory, etc.)
As long as this perception exists, many people would be reluctant to seek their treatments at puskesmas, and prefer to seek treatments with private providers, even when they charge much more than puskesmas
Private providers are not included in (or refused) to join the JPKM scheme
This reduces the access and choice of JPKM members in their health care, since they could only use their entitlement at public facilities (puskesmas and RSUD)
This might contribute to the perception of some JPKM members that the health services offered by the public providers are inadequate or lacking in quality
Inclusion of private providers should be (encouraged by offering an appropriate level of compensation/reimbursement to them
This would increase access to, and choice of, health services for JPKM members
Inclusion could also increase competition and quality standards
It is difficult to determine whether healthcare providers are operating efficiently, since even with JPKM/JPK-Gakin, most of their expenditures are reimbursed by the Bapel
Thus, JPKM is in practice not an insurance scheme, but just a health financing mechanism, in which the government fully subsidizes the health spending of the poor, and also partially subsidizes regular, paid JPKM members
RSUD officials believe that the quality of health services at the RSUD has improved since the enactment of the JPKM scheme, because RSUD management has increased “incentive payments” for its staff
In addition, the RSUD has purchased new hospital beds (although we observed that many of the new beds are in the Class I and VIP category, which is assumed to be for patients who can afford to pay the entire cost of their health care themselves and are not JPKM members)
B
SUSTAINABILITY 
This health insurance scheme is not sustainable as it is highly dependent on large sums of subsidies
First of all, the premium for the poor is fully paid by BBM subsidies and in addition DAU is used for partial contributions to all three strata
Secondly, the health care services are also subsidized through other funds, such as regular appropriations by the local government to subsidize the operational expenses of puskesmas
Puskesmas also receive government subsidies to purchase medicines and medical equipment
We have been unable to determine however, whether the capitation payments set for the different health care providers have had an effect on containing costs
During the first and second year, the expenditures of the RSUD exceeded the budget (incurred a deficit)
This deficit has since decreased, due to increasing capitation funding for the RSUD
Whether or not there will be a deficit is still in question and the RSUD is not answering it
RSUD officials also do not think that the deficit could turn into a serious financing problem in the future
Their attitude seems to be that as long as the district government continues to channel money to them, there won't be any problems
Thus, there is no incentive for puskesmas to try to control costs and reduce expenditures in order to avoid deficit spending
This, combined with lack of monitoring of RSUD financing by Bapel (see above), casts some doubt over the long-term sustainability of the JPKM program, since financial sustainability requires a good financial plan that is enforceable and also accountability measures to prevent abuse/misuse of program funds
There seems to be little financial planning and control done by both Bapel and providers to maintain the efficiency of the scheme and to eliminate unnecessary expenditures
There are also no clear measures to ensure financial accountability of health providers in using the funds received from the Bapel
Without these, the scheme will be vulnerable to possible abuse and fraud, which could endanger its long-term sustainability
The planned increase in JPKM insurance premiums to reflect its real market value in the next few years (to about Rp96,000/person/year) could potentially reduce the number of members participating in the scheme
This could also endanger the program's sustainability, especially if the number of members dropping out of the scheme is significant
IV
CONCLUDING REMARKS 
The JPKM scheme in Purbalingga has been more successful in providing access to adequate health care coverage to members of the population, especially the poor
The number of people enrolled as JPKM members is quite substantial in comparison to similar schemes in other districts, thanks largely to extensive marketing and socialization efforts undertaken by kaders
The largely successful use of kaders in socializing the JPKM scheme in Purbalingga is of special attention and may provide the model for similar schemes in other Indonesian districts/regions
The Purbalingga scheme needs to be improved in several ways however, in order to enhance its effectiveness and increase the number of people willing to join it
In addition, there are a few problems that need to be addressed by the Bapel and the health providers that could hinder the effectiveness of JPKM in delivering its service to its members, such as the following
There appears to be significant pressure to enroll more paying JPKM members into the scheme, for instance, by increasing the puskesmas' user fees and by upgrading many Gakin/Strata I members into Strata II/post Gakin status
These steps might be premature, considering the fact that there might be some Gakin families that in reality are still Gakin, but are forced to move up to Strata II status as a result of these pressures
This might force them to drop their JPKM membership altogether, since they are not able to afford the premium
The pressure to include more paying members into the JPKM scheme should be balanced by a concern to provide fair treatment to its members based on their ability to pay
There appear to be formal and informal barriers made to discourage some Gakin members from using the services they are entitled to, such as
the high transportation cost, the delay in the distribution of their membership card, etc
Such barriers might negate the function of JPKM as a health assistance scheme for the poor and could result in the misallocation of Gakin subsidies to the supposedly better-off members at Strata II and III level, who can theoretically afford to pay some of their own health care costs
There seems to be a lack of efficiency in the use of JPKM funds by health providers (especially RSUD)
As long as the payment system is operating de facto as a FFS, cost control would not be achieved and the use of more expensive health services/treatments that might not be necessary for patients would be encouraged
There is little monitoring done by the Bapel and DinKes on the use of JPKM funds by health providers
It is not known whether all the reimbursement claims made by the providers are claims for services actually provided
This could provide the opportunity to misuse the funds through the submission of fraudulent claims
There is little involvement of non-government stakeholders (especially JPKM members) in the design, implementation and monitoring of the scheme
JPKM members are just passive clients who pay the premium, receive the membership card, and receive health services from JPKM providers
They do not participate in the decision-making of the scheme itself
This makes the management of the program less transparent and accountable to its stakeholders, especially its members
There is no involvement of private health providers in the provision of health services for JPKM members
They are only able to seek health services in publicly managed health facilities (puskesmas and RSUD)
Part of the reason for private providers not participating in JPKM is its low reimbursement rate for health services performed, which is set at a rate much lower than the market price
In any case, the fact that private providers do not participate in the scheme results in a more limited choice of health providers available for its members, which could deny them access to better quality services
To address these problems and to make the JPKM scheme in Purbalingga work better, the following steps are recommended to be implemented by the Purbalingga government
Improve the quality of services provided by puskesmas
Many citizens perceive puskesmas to have a low service quality, and thus, they are not willing to seek health care treatment there
If puskesmas services are improved, it is hoped that its image among community members would be improved as well, and thus, more citizens and JPKM members would seek their health treatment there
Reduce or eliminate the formal and informal barriers for Gakin families to use the services to which they are entitled
This could be achieved by speeding up the distribution of Gakin membership cards and by providing some transportation subsidies for Gakin patients
The government also needs to eliminate the misallocation of Gakin subsidies to higher income/Strata groups, to ensure that the JPKM scheme truly meets its intended purpose to provide health financing for poor families
Improve the efficiency of health services delivery by health providers (puskesmas and RSUD)
Health services given to JPKM members should be appropriate to their needs and should be medically necessary
The use of more expensive but not medically necessary services/treatments should be discouraged by the imposition of efficiencycontrolling mechanisms
Provide more strict monitoring (both internal and external) to ensure that the JPKM funds allocated to provide health services at RSUD and puskesmas are spent effectively and efficiently
The monitoring should be done both by Bapel (or Bawasda) and also by an independent monitoring unit that could be set up by the community or by a JPKM members' association
Implement measures to increase JPKM members' participation in the planning, implementation and monitoring of the JPKM scheme
The members should be allowed a voice in the decision-making process affecting their welfare and their membership in the JPKM scheme
The creation of a JPKM members' association would be the first step to achieving this goal
Incentives should be created to make the kaders more productive in recruiting new members
This could include regular honorariums for kaders that would be higher than the current incentive payments available to them (Rp1,000 per new member signed up)
Consider including private providers (e.g private doctors, private hospitals and health clinics) in the list of providers of the JPKM scheme
This would increase the choice of providers for members of the scheme and would improve their access to needed health services
In order to attract private providers into the scheme, higher capitation payments might be necessary so that the payment would be in line with the market rate charged by private providers
This might however, require a premium increase, that might force some JPKM members to drop out of the scheme because they could no longer afford the premium
Thus, the costs and benefits of expanding the choice of providers needs to be carefully weighed
Consider charging a minimum premium rate or co-insurance for Gakin/Strata I members, since it seems that paying JPKM members are more likely to demand better services from the providers than non-paying ones
In addition, they are more likely to complain when these services are not delivered to their satisfaction
This would motivate Gakin members to demand better services from providers as well
Of course, the charges imposed on Gakin members should be set at an appropriate minimal level so that they would not drop out from the JPKM scheme altogether due to affordability issues
ABSTRACT 
The State of Local Governance and Public Services in the Decentralized Indonesia in 2006
Findings from the Governance and Decentralization Survey 2 (GDS2)
The Governance and Decentralization Survey (GDS) aims to evaluate the implementation of local governance and decentralization policy in Indonesia
The GDS was designed to initiate a database that will be used for the evaluation
Similar to the previous GDS rounds, the GDS2 is an integrated survey of households, public health and education facilities, private health practitioners, hamlet heads (kepala dusun), and district- and village-level officials
In total, around 32,000 respondents were interviewed and it was implemented in 133 districts
This report provides an assessment of many aspects of household access to public services, especially health, education, and public administration, from both the supply and demand side
Other social aspects are also included in the analysis, such as conditions of security, social and political participation, and conflict
In addition, the GDS2 incorporates an assessment of the central government's program related to the reduction in the fuel price subsidy, known as the Fuel Subsidy Reduction Compensation Program (PKPS-BBM)
The survey analysis is disaggregated by three World Bank projects, namely the Support for Poor and Disadvantaged Areas Project (SPADA), Initiatives for Local Governance Reform Project (ILGRP), and Urban Sector Development and Reform Program (USDRP), which were accommodated in the GDS2 sampling design

governance, decentralization, PKPS-BBM assessment
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1
The decentralization system of government that has been implemented in Indonesia since 2001 has transferred the responsibility for primary health, education (except for tertiary level), basic infrastructure, economy, agriculture, and the environment from the central government to local governments
Since the initial implementation period, many efforts to improve the practice of decentralization and governance at local levels have been implemented
Some of them are supported by international and bilateral donor agencies
The Governance and Decentralization Survey (GDS) is one of the initiatives that aim to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the governance and decentralization policy in Indonesia
2
The GDS2, as a continuation of the GDS1 and GDS1+, has three objectives
The first objective is to evaluate the performance of local service providers, the satisfaction of service consumers, and the condition of local governance, with a view towards informing particular policy questions on decentralization
The second objective is to monitor and evaluate the performance of World Bank, ADB, and GTZ projects that are engaged in decentralization and governance activities
The three World Bank projects covered in GDS2 in 53 districts are
Support for Poor and Disadvantaged Areas Project (SPADA); Initiatives for Local Governance Reform Project (ILGRP); and Urban Sector Development and Reform Program (USDRP)
Furthermore, the GDS2 seeks to provide a baseline of information for these projects
The baseline will be used to assess the relative impact of individual project efforts over time
The third objective is to provide input for evaluating the unconditional cash transfer for the poor and near poor families (SLT), the school operational funds (BOS), the health insurance for poor families (Askeskin), and the rural infrastructure (IP) programs, which were all intended to mitigate the impact of the fuel price increases
3
GDS2 was undertaken during the months of April to July 2006
According to survey documentation, GDS2 was implemented in 133 districts
However, it is found in the data that for some groups of respondents, GDS2 covers more than 133 districts, reaching up to 140 districts
There is no explanation in the survey documentation about this discrepancy
Similar to the previous GDS, the GDS2 is an integrated survey of households, public health and education facilities, private health practitioners, hamlet heads (kepala dusun), and district- and village-level officials
In total, around 32,000 respondents were interviewed
4
Village heads were asked questions on public services
Responses for the adequacy of public services varied greatly, ranging from 24% of village heads that stated irrigation services are sufficient to 65% that stated legal procedures are sufficient
When asked to compare the available public services and identify the service that they believe to be the most sufficient, roads and clean water were mentioned most often, at 24% and 22% respectively
5
Access to education services is measured by using variables related to transportation to school for students and the proportion of school-aged household members who are actually enrolled in school disaggregated by the level of schooling
The findings suggest that most students walk to school, but the proportion of students who walk to school declines the higher the level of education
Almost 80% of primary school students walk to school
This is not surprising given that there is a primary school in almost every village
Travel time and transportation costs to school become gradually higher the higher the level of education
On average, students spend 15 to 20 minutes in travel time to school
Those who pay for transportation to school spend between Rp2,000 and Rp5,000 each day on average
The pattern of enrollment rates across education levels follows the known national pattern, where the enrollment rate declines with the level of education, however, the enrollment levels are found to be lower than those reported at the national level
For primary education, for instance, the net enrollment rate in the recent year is reported around 95% while in this data it is only 72%
There are no significant differences in enrollment rates at the primary level across World Bank project areas
6
The assessment of access to health services is also based on transportation matters
However, prior to the assessment, filtering information such as whether the respondent knows about the existence of the nearest health providers is also assessed
People's knowledge about the presence of the nearest puskesmas (community health center) is much better than for public hospitals
This may be due to the fact that puskesmas, which are mostly available at the subdistrict (kecamatan) level, are usually closer to people's residences than public hospitals, which are usually only found at the district level
This is consistent with other indicators such as the mode of transportation and travel time to the health service provider
For instance, it is common to walk to the smaller-scale health service providers such as affiliate community health centers (pustu), village maternity posts (polindes), and mobile community health centers (puskesmas keliling)
Travel time figures are an even better way to describe the accessibility of each health service provider
7
The village service administration access is measured using variables related to the ease of obtaining an identity card (KTP)
Sixty-one percent of households have a member who has obtained a KTP during the past 2 years and around 74% of them claim to know the procedure to obtain a KTP
The average length of time needed to obtain a KTP is 7.4 days in the USDRP areas, but much longer at 17.6 days in the SPADA areas
However, the cost of obtaining a KTP does not differ too much across regions, averaging around Rp19,000
The use of informal intermediaries (perantara) is prevalent in efforts to obtain a KTP
47% of households using them
Hamlet heads report that a higher number of days and higher cost are required to obtain a KTP than reported by village heads
Village heads evaluated the village officials' efforts to disseminate the procedure for obtaining a KTP more highly than the hamlet heads
When asked about the approximate percentage of people using informal intermediaries when they need to obtain a KTP, hamlet heads reported that 62% of people use intermediaries
8
Only 15% of households have access to information on their village's budget allocation and only 25% can access information regarding village development programs
These proportions do not differ much across World Bank project areas
Awareness of the existence of the Village Representative Body (BPD/DK) is relatively widespread, with 48% of households aware of its existence
9
In the 2 years prior to the survey, 19% of households have accessed police services
29% were asked to pay "settlement money", a euphemism for a bribe
During the same period, 15% of households had a member who had obtained a driving license, implying that around 80% of households that have accessed police services were doing so in order to obtain driving licenses
In the USDRP (urban) areas, the average length of time to obtain a driving license is 2 days, while in the SPADA areas it takes more than six days
However, the cost of obtaining a driving license is higher in the USDRP areas
The shorter time and higher cost required in the USDRP areas are probably related to the fact that this region has the highest use of informal intermediaries
In general, 36% of households use intermediaries and 80% of the intermediaries are police officers
10
According to households, crime is the main cause for the disputes and conflicts that occur most frequently
In contrast, village heads state that land and building issues are the main cause for disputes and conflicts
However, the proportion of village heads that acknowledge the occurrence of disputes and conflicts is around three to four times that of households
In general, most respondents feel satisfied with the resolutions of disputes and conflicts, with the exception of households that are dissatisfied with the resolution of disputes and conflicts stemming from power abuse
11
Approximately one-half of households stated that their level of participation in village activities is the same now as it was 2 years ago, while around one-third of households feel that their participation has increased
Around 10% of households say that their participation has decreased
These proportions are similar across all areas
12
Participation in local elections is quite high
94% of households voted in the recent district head elections, except in the USDRP areas where only 87% voted
However, only 44% of those who voted knew about the candidates' backgrounds
In all areas, most of those who voted put emphasis on the candidates' programs and experiences when considering whom to vote for
In general, the roles of ethnicity and religion are not prominent in determining the voting
The exception is in the ILGRP areas where these two aspects are considered by a relatively large proportion of voters
Administrative and logistical problems were the main reasons for abstention
Only 21% of those who abstained were genuinely not interested in voting
13
An important indicator for governance aside from transparency is the extent of corruption
Very few people admitted to knowing of corruption or bribery cases in various public service institutions the past 2 years
The highest level of acknowledgment was found for bribery at the police institution, with 19% of households claiming to know of cases of bribery
The second highest figure is for corruption occurring at the village offices, at around 9%
Educational institutions are not free from illegal transactions either
Nine percent of households are aware of cases of corruption and/or bribery that have taken place at educational institutions
Comparing World Bank project areas, the highest proportion of people who are aware of corruption and bribery cases was found in the USDRP areas, while the lowest proportion of people who are aware of these illegal activities was found in the SPADA areas
14
The overall assessment of education services is quite positive
Seventy-one percent of households think that generally education services are currently better than 2 years ago
This positive assessment is prevalent across areas, with the highest in ILGRP areas (76%) and the lowest in SPADA areas (67%)
Consistent with this, around 80% of households are either satisfied or fairly satisfied with the current education services, a proportion that is similar across all study areas
Nevertheless, across all areas, household respondents consistently mentioned four major aspects of education services that require improvement
student learning achievements (29%), condition of school buildings and facilities (27%), teachers' attention to their students (17%), and affordability of the cost of education services (8%)
15
The overall assessment of health services is also positive
Seventy-one percent of household respondents think that currently overall health services are better than 2 years ago
This positive assessment is similar across areas, with the highest in USDRP areas (74%) and the lowest in SPADA areas (63%)
In line with this finding, around 90% of household respondents are either satisfied or fairly satisfied with current health services—a figure that is also similar across areas
Nevertheless, consistently across the areas, respondents identify five major aspects of health services that require improvement
the availability of medicines and vaccine stock (24%), affordability of medical services (20%), the physical condition of health service location (19%), the attention and caring attitude of medical personnel (15%), and waiting time at health service providers (7%)
16
There is a high percentage of school principals involved in the determination of a school's vision and mission both for primary and junior secondary schools, at 94% and 97% respectively
However, the involvement rate of school principals in other decisionmaking processes such as choosing the curriculum and determining the reference books are much lower
17
The involvement of puskesmas heads in determining puskesmas tariffs according to their own account is much lower than that reported by the Health Office
According to the puskesmas heads, the involvement rates ranged from 24% in the SPADA districts to 45% in the USDRP districts
Whereas, according to district health offices, the involvement rate ranges from around 71% in the SPADA districts to 100% in the USDRP districts
18
The Fuel Subsidy Reduction Compensation Programs (PKPS-BBM) have national coverage and are managed by the central government
According to information from the bureaucrats in the survey, however, some districts were reported as not being covered by the PKPS-BBM in the health sector, education sector, and village infrastructure
Further verification may be needed to determine if the programs were really not implemented in those areas or if there were problems with the data collection or input
19
Though there are remaining problems with the implementation of the four PKPS-BBM programs, particularly with the socialization and targeting aspects, many stakeholders responded that the programs have generally resulted in positive impacts
For example, based on the reported use of SLT funds, it can be concluded that the funds were particularly helpful for beneficiary households, especially in helping them to fulfill consumption needs such as paying for food, kerosene, school fees, medicines, and also paying debts
20
From the perspective of school principals, the School Operational Assistance (BOS) program has had a significant positive impact on several aspects of schooling, particularly quality of teaching, availability of books and teaching equipment, quality of school infrastructure, and access to school for poor students
Similarly, the Health Insurance for the Poor (Askeskin) program has contributed to increasing the proportion of poor people who can access health care services, while the village infrastructure program benefits most villagers by providing better village infrastructure
I
OVERVIEW 1.1 
Background Decentralization and its reforms are currently ongoing in the majority of developing countries
In general, however, the nature of reforms in each country varies across sectors as does the governance and capacity of local governments
Indonesia passed two laws on local governments and their financing in 1999, which laid the foundations for the adoption of decentralized governance in the country starting in 2001
However, reflecting the general dissatisfaction with the decentralization laws, both were revised in 2004, only 3 years after the start of decentralization in Indonesia
The decentralized system that has been in place in Indonesia since 2001 has transferred the responsibility for the primary health, education (except for tertiary education), basic infrastructure, economy, agriculture, and environment sectors from the central government to local governments
In addition, in June 2005 there was a change in the method of appointing local government leaders at both the provincial and district levels
While previously local government leaders were elected by members of local parliament, they are now directly elected by the local community
Many other efforts related to decentralization and local governance have been undertaken since the initial implementation period, some of which are or have been supported by international and bilateral donor agencies
The Governance and Decentralization Survey (GDS) is one of the initiatives that aimed to evaluate the implementation of the local governance and decentralization policy in Indonesia
The GDS was designed to initiate a database that will be used for the evaluation
Three rounds of the GDS have been conducted in the period 2002–2006
GDS1 in 2002, GDS1+ in 2004, and GDS2 in 2006
The World Bank commissioned all three surveys to the Center for Population and Policy Studies of Gadjah Mada University (CPPS GMU), Yogyakarta
In addition to the regular local governance and decentralization questions, the GDS2 incorporates an assessment of the government's program related to the reduction in the fuel price subsidy, known as the Fuel Subsidy Reduction Compensation Program (PKPS-BBM)
The evaluated program components include
(i) the Unconditional Cash Transfer (SLT), (ii) School Operational Assistance (BOS), (iii) Health Insurance for Poor Families (Askeskin), and (iv) the Village Infrastructure (IP) program
The GDS2 sampling, which included the locations of three World Bank projects, provides another advantage as it enables the GDS2 analysis to be disaggregated by the three projects
1.2 Objectives of the GDS2 
The GDS2, as a continuation of the GDS1 and the GDS1+, has three objectives
The first objective is to evaluate the performance of local service providers, the satisfaction of service consumers, and the condition of local governance, with a view towards informing particular policy questions on decentralization
The general focus is discerning facility efficiency in the delivery of public education and health services as well as different household group satisfaction with and preferences for education and health services
The survey also seeks to capture the key institutional and governance factors that are important for determining public education and health service outcomes
The second objective is to monitor and evaluate the performance of World Bank, ADB, and GTZ projects that are engaged in decentralization and governance activities
Furthermore, the GDS2 seeks to provide a baseline of information for these projects
The baseline will be used to assess the relative impact of individual project efforts over time
Finally, the third objective is to provide input for evaluating the Unconditional Cash Transfer (SLT), School Operational Assistance (BOS), Health Insurance for Poor Families (Askeskin), and Rural Infrastructure (IP) programs
These programs were all intended to help mitigate the impact of the fuel price increases for the poor
The SMERU Research Institute was commissioned to analyze GDS2 data for the three World Bank district project areas covered by the survey, resulting in this report
II
ASSESSING GOVERNANCE AND DECENTRALIZATION
DATA AND METHOD 
2.1 Review of GDS1 and GDS1+ GDS1
The GDS1 was held in 177 districts/cities (kabupaten/kota) in 20 provinces, using 12 different questionnaires for 12 different types of respondents, ranging from households, bureaucrats, and local parliament members to NGO activists, journalists, judges, lawyers, District Attorneys, and private enterprises
The size of district samples accounts for 51% of the total of 348 districts/cities existing in Indonesia in 2002
In total, almost 17,000 respondents were interviewed in this first GDS survey
The field work was carried out by the Center for Population and Policy Studies of Gadjah Mada University (CPPS GMU)
The districts in the sample were selected using stratified random sampling
For the first stage, 20 provinces were selected from the total of 30 provinces using a purposive sampling method
Then, within those 20 provinces, 150 districts/cities were randomly selected from the total of 348 districts/cities that received General Allocation Funds (DAU) in 2001
The fieldwork was conducted by a network of sixteen universities around the country following centralized and decentralized surveys and CAFE (computer assisted field entry) training
Twenty-seven districts were then added as these additional districts were being evaluated by one of the WB's proposed local government governance reform projects, the Kabupaten Governance Reform Initiative Project (KGRIP), that were not covered in the original basic GDS sample (this also meant extending survey coverage to two additional provinces)
The survey was fielded in February–April 2002 for the first 150 districts/cities and May–June 2002 for the additional 27 districts
The GDS1 had two objectives
The first was to compile primary and secondary data to allow stakeholders to better understand the decentralization process and its connection with governance over the following few years
The second was to utilize empirical data-based information to promote supportive and democratic policy at the local government level
The collected data was classified into indicators for governance and decentralization and covered various thematic areas
The governance indicators include thematic areas on
participation effectiveness and efficiency transparency equity rule of law responsiveness accountability conflict management The decentralization indicators include thematic areas on understanding of local autonomy; 
the restructuring process, based on size and level of relevance; 
awareness of public needs and services, including budget allocation for education, health, and poverty reduction; 
increasing the quality of services; 
the number of local regulations (perda) based on public need and official interests; 
capacity and investment in staff; existence of poverty reduction institutions; 
and private sector and public perception on corruption, collusion, and nepotism (KKN), investment, and bureaucratic costs
GDS1+ The GDS1+ was fielded in May-June 2004, and covered only 32 districts (24 districts and 8 cities) out of the 177 districts/cities included in the GDS1
The field work was also carried out by the Center for Population and Policy Studies of Gadjah Mada University (CPPS GMU)
In total, around 5,000 respondents were interviewed for the survey
The survey respondents were users of public services, such as households, community health center patients, and members of school committees
The survey team also interviewed a high-level local bureaucrat and heads of the local health and education offices in each district
The GDS1+ covered eight provinces—North and South Sumatra, West, Central and East Java, West Nusa Tenggara, South Kalimantan, and South Sulawesi—which were purposively selected out of the 32 provinces in Indonesia in 2003
These provinces were selected in order to maximize population coverage, but also in consideration of the logistics and costs of the survey implementation
Three districts and one city were randomly selected within each province, leading to coverage of the 416 districts/cities in Indonesia as of the beginning of December 2003
The first goal of the GDS1+ was to further develop the methodology and implementation capacity for the scheduled second large survey (the GDS2) and to systematically test it
The second goal was to provide timely results on emerging trends in service delivery and governance, rather than a comprehensive picture on the state of public service delivery in the entire archipelago
For this reason, the sample is more limited in its regional coverage than GDS1, but in the sample size of each district
Contrary to the concerns that decentralization may lead to deterioration of governance and public services and to local capture rather than the traditional gains from decentralization, the GDS1+ provides interesting indications for the emerging trends in public service delivery
There are some encouraging indications that services have not declined in terms of quality
Public satisfaction with the quality of service delivery is improving following decentralization
In fact, perceptions of decentralized services such as health, education, and local administration are improving more strongly than those of centralized services (i.e., the Indonesian National Police)
Police services, which remain centralized, continue to be perceived as being of highly insufficient quality and no upward trend was apparent
This constitutes a major cause for concern regarding issues such as corruption, which continues to be widespread, at least in administrative service delivery
Though some of the results from the survey are encouraging, the major agenda to ensure greater accountability is still unresolved
Transaction costs remain high, as evidenced by the continued need to pay bribes, high incidence of intermediaries for public services, and the continued importance of personal connections
2.2 GDS2 Sampling and Analysis 
Method Data collection for the GDS2 was undertaken during the months of April to July 2006
The total number of districts included in the sample was 134
In addition, 6 districts in Nias and Aceh involved in ANPEA (Aceh and Nias Public Expenditure Analysis) were added to the sample, expanding the total number of districts in the sample to 140
However, the survey in the ANPEA districts excluded the household, school teacher, school committee, private health provider, and general hospital instruments
Similar to the previous GDS rounds, the GDS2 is an integrated survey of households, public health and education facilities, private health practitioners, hamlet heads (kepala dusun), and district- and village-level officials
In total, around 32,000 respondents were interviewed
The survey instrument is designed to assemble detailed information on the provision and use of local public services, as well as the governance environment in which those services are delivered and used
Due to the implementation of the new scheme of the Fuel Subsidy Reduction Compensation Program (PKPS-BBM), the GDS2 also assesses the implementation of four PKPS-BBM programs, namely the Unconditional Cash Transfer (SLT), School Operational Assistance (BOS), Health Insurance for Poor Families (Askeskin), and Rural Infrastructure (IP) programs
Fifty-three districts of the three World Bank district project areas are covered in the GDS2 and will be included in the analysis
The actual numbers of sample respondents and districts by sample group, as calculated from the data, are provided in Table 2.3.1
Based on the number of sample districts, it is apparent that the survey interviews were carried out in more than 133 districts (some are less than 133 due to the nonexistence of certain types of providers in some districts) for certain groups of respondents
The list of districts covered in the GDS2, including their participation in the examined World Bank projects, is provided in Table A.2.1 in the appendix
The descriptive analysis of the data in this report will be disaggregated by the type of project implemented in the districts
This will provide a baseline for estimating the impact of those projects on the implementation of decentralization, including good governance
In addition, the analysis of service delivery will consider the perspectives of both clients and providers
2.3 Review of SPADA, ILGRP, and USDRP 
Projects Fifty-three of the 140 districts covered by the GDS2 are host to three World Bank projects, consisting of 35 SPADA districts, 13 ILGRP districts, and 5 USDRP districts
Support for Poor and Disadvantaged Areas (SPADA) The SPADA program aims to help the Indonesian government address the problems of governance and poverty in the 100 poorest districts in the country
From the 100 districts covered by SPADA project, 50 have poverty closely tied to two post-1998 events
Forty of these districts experienced significant conflict during the 1998-2003 post-New Order turmoil
The other ten districts are in Aceh, where poverty was not only exacerbated by an accelerating antiseparatist military action, but where the devastating tidal wave of 26 December 2004 killed more than 170,000 people and left another 500,000 people displaced
This project provides subdistricts with unmarked block grants of Rp500 million, Rp750 million, or Rp1 billion, depending on their population
A small fund for operational support is also included as part of the district and subdistrict grants
The program will bring the reconstruction process to post-conflict areas and other neglected areas
Hence, all components of SPADA support the same process of bottom-up facilitation to identify and prioritize perceived reconstruction needs
The decision forums at subdistrict and district levels should identify those needs in the form of expected results
The SPADA response will be tailored to the needs identified in each district
In addition to the need for reconstruction, the local capacities of the selected districts were considered to be very low
Therefore, SPADA provides a substantial investment to improve the capacity of local stakeholders through a combination of training, practical exercises, professional practical support, and by developing learning networks
The project also finances subdistrict and district consultants to strengthen district, subdistrict, and village administrative capacities
The project also includes three major kinds of implementation support as follows
technical assistance for each level of government, an oversight and monitoring unit in each province, and a multi-sectoral support team in each participating district
The monitoring, evaluation, and studies of SPADA need a sophisticated monitoring and evaluation system, which is a package of quantitative and qualitative baseline data
Three types of activities are conducted in order to achieve the project's objective
strengthening community-led planning and dispute resolution processes, promoting private investment and job creation, and increasing the utilization of effective education and health services
Due to the scope of these activities, the Home Affairs, Public Works, Education, Health, and Finance ministries are involved in the implementation
The provincial government is responsible for operational project coordination and the Regional Development Planning Board (Bappeda) coordinates each level of the project
It is important to note that SPADA is intended to help conflict affected provinces return to normality, but repeat projects are not expected to be sustainable
Hence, a bridging period is needed for the time between the end of hostilities and the resumption of normal development, at which point the project would be handed over to the other models that are being developed through ILGRP and USDRP
Initiatives for Local Governance Reform Project (ILGRP) This project was initially named the Kabupaten Governance Reform Initiatives Project (KGRIP)
Renamed by the World Bank and the Government of Indonesia to the Initiatives for Local Governance Reform Program (ILGRP), the project focuses on governance reforms linked to poverty alleviation
The aim of this project is to pilot mechanisms to reward reform-minded local governments that are willing to develop local participatory poverty alleviation initiatives based on citizen choice
It also supports institutionalization of democratization and poverty reduction at the local level
Specifically, the reform focuses on the areas of transparency and participation, public procurement, and financial management
In addition to the foundation of local regulatory framework reforms and concrete initiatives, ILGRP supports reforms in project management and implementation by providing funds for public investment in infrastructure development, as identified in local Poverty Reduction Strategy and Action Plans (PRSAP)
The project activities had started since October 2002
Initially, ILGRP facilitated 22 districts
Through continuous monitoring and evaluation after all districts were initially evaluated in April-May 2003, facilitation was discontinued in six districts in July 2003
Pesisir Selatan (West Sumatra), Indramayu (West Java), Kulonprogo (Yogyakarta), Sidoarjo (East Java), Gorontalo (Gorontalo), and Tana Toraja (South Sulawesi)
This was mainly due to lack of support from local stakeholders and inconsistencies with the principles of good governance promoted by the project
In June 2003, Kabupaten Bantaeng in South Sulawesi withdrew from the program
Hence, 15 districts remain in the program
ILGRP targeted nine provinces—West Sumatra, Banten, West Java, Central Java, Yogyakarta, East Java, Gorontalo, North Sulawesi, and South Sulawesi—which account for 63% of the Indonesian population
ILGRP districts were then selected based on geographic clusters, to enable the efficient delivery of technical assistance and information
The remaining 15 districts are Solok and Tanah Datar (West Sumatra); Lebak (Banten); Bandung and Majalengka (West Java); Kebumen and Magelang (Central Java); Bantul (DI Yogyakarta); Ngawi and Lamongan (East Java); Bolaang Mongondow (North Sulawesi); Boalemo (Gorontalo); and Gowa, Takalar, and Bulukumba (South Sulawesi)
This program is expected to have a direct positive impact on poor households and an indirect positive impact on all citizens in the districts by increasing pro-poor service delivery, budget allocation, and reducing corruption and the overall cost of doing business (improving the investment climate)
Thus, the following four key areas of policy and institutional reforms have been proposed at both the national and local levels
(i) enhancing accountability and transparency in the local planning and legislative process, 
(ii) strengthening local government financial management and standard accounting practices, 
(iii) supporting a subnational procurement reform agenda, and (iv) supporting the national poverty reduction agenda
Furthermore, the program seeks to replicate the Local Governance Reform Framework, which was formulated and adopted by the central government and all participating districts, in other local governments
Urban Sector Development Reform Program (USDRP) The USDRP is a comprehensive program responding to the needs of civil society under a decentralized and democratic environment
As indicated by the project's title, the program is carried out only in urban areas
The USDRP's objectives are to support local governments in their efforts to alleviate poverty, to stimulate the development of local/regional economies, and to improve the delivery of sustainable and demand-driven urban services
The ultimate goal of these efforts is to improve the quality of life of the urban population
In order to achieve those objectives, the project would ensure that participating urban local governments (ULGs)
a) select prioritized investments for infrastructure development that are based on an agreed long-term development strategy and medium-term development plan (RPJM);
b) engage in governance reforms that foster participation, transparency, and accountability as well as internal management reform focusing on procurement of goods and services and financial management; and 
c) develop institutional and regulatory capacity for better delivery of urban services and determine and implement priority investments in a participatory and accountable way
The USDRP is building on the approach taken by other urban development projects, such as the Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development Program (IUIDP)
The IUIDP placed investment in infrastructure as a primary objective
The USDRP views urban development in a more comprehensive way, and hence considers investment in infrastructure as only one part of a broad-based approach to development
USDRP also includes the establishment and implementation of comprehensive governance reforms and improvement of public service delivery capacities of participating ULGs
the USDRP is encouraging participating ULGs to identify subprojects using an “open menu” approach
whereby they have the opportunity to invest without specific sector limitations
However, public works and transportation are the main investment sectors concerned
The identification and selection process for subprojects must be conducted in a participatory way, involving local government, councils, and a stakeholders' forum (SF)
The proposed subprojects, however, should be socially, environmentally, and economically viable and in line with the medium-term development plan
The project's framework also includes isolated and vulnerable people (IVP) as part of its safeguarding framework
2.4 Sample Household Characteristics
The following tables describe the socioeconomic characteristics of the sample households
Table 2.4.1 provides summaries of household head characteristics (sex, education attainment, employment status, ability to read and write, and age), household characteristics (household size), and housing characteristics (roofing, walls, flooring, electricity, access to clean water and sanitation)
Table 2.4.2 provides the details of household asset ownership
Table 2.4.3 assesses household economic conditions measured by household per capita expenditure, as well as household head qualitative assessments of their current household economic condition compared to that of 2 years ago
These and the rest of the tables are disaggregated by World Bank project areas (SPADA, ILGRP, USDRP) and the rest of the sample districts are grouped as non-WB project areas
Table 2.4.1 shows that the mean age of household heads in the sample is 46 years, but in the USDRP areas, which are urban areas, it is slightly higher at 48 years
Around 10% of households in the sample have a female household head
In the USDRP areas, the proportion of households headed by women in the sample is slightly higher at 13%
In terms of education level, 59% of household heads in the sample have only attained a primary education, 16% have a junior secondary education, 19% have a senior secondary education, and only 6% have a tertiary education
The educational attainment of household heads in the sample is higher in the USDRP areas than in the other areas; only 39% have only a primary education and 16% have a tertiary education
In general, more than 80% of household heads are able to read and write
Around 90% of them are working, except in the USDRP areas where the employment rate of household heads is only 83%
The average household in the sample has 4.5 members
They live in a house with an average area of 20 square meters per person, except in the SPADA areas where the average area of the house is only 16 square meters per person
Housing conditions differ across areas
The worst conditions are generally found in the SPADA areas while the best conditions exist in the USDRP areas
Table 2.4.2 shows that more than 82% of households in the sample own the home that they live in, except in the USDRP area where the home ownership rate is only 76%
Another 12% of households live in homes owned by a relative
Many of the households own various assets, notably land and motorcycles
In addition, 12% of households own houses other than their place of residence
Table 2.4.3 shows that the nominal average household per capita monthly expenditure in the USDRP areas (Rp252,198) is almost double that of the SPADA areas (Rp134,865)
Although the cost of living in urban areas is higher than in rural areas, this is a strong indication that the rural population is significantly poorer than urban residents
When households were asked to compare their current economic condition with that of 2 years ago, 32% stated that they are better off now than they were 2 years ago, 31% state their economic condition is the same, and 37% stated that they are now worse off
These proportions are similar across regions, with the exception of the USDRP areas, where less stated that they are now better off (28%) and more stated that they are now worse off (42%)
III
SERVICE DELIVERY 
3.1 Access to Public Services 
In the GDS2, only village heads (kepala desa) and hamlet heads (kepala dusun) were asked the questions on access to public services (excluding education and health services)
Household respondents were not asked these questions
Tables 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 show the respective village head and hamlet head assessments of public services and facilities provided by district/city governments
Table 3.1.1 shows that when village heads were asked whether the various public services available in their areas were sufficient, positive responses ranged from 24% who felt that irrigation system services are sufficient to 65% who responded that legal procedures are sufficient
This is consistent with anecdotal evidence that the aftermath of the economic crisis has led to the deterioration of much of the irrigation systems in the country
Furthermore, since decentralization, many district governments have not paid enough attention to the deteriorating state of their local irrigation systems
If the sample areas are divided by the World Bank project areas, USDRP areas generally have the highest proportion of village heads who feel that public services in their areas are sufficient (the only exception was irrigation systems), while SPADA areas have the lowest proportion
This is not surprising considering that USDRP areas are urban, while SPADA areas are disadvantaged and left-behind rural regions
When the village heads were asked to compare available public services and choose the one that they think is the most sufficient, roads and clean water received the best results, at 24% and 22% respectively
This pattern is similar when sample areas are disaggregated by the World Bank project areas, except for ILGRP areas where 21% of village heads nominated public transportation as the best service
Curiously, when the village heads were asked to select the least sufficient public services, the highest rates are also for roads and clean water with 23% and 22% respectively
This indicates that the conditions of roads and clean water supplies vary widely across regions, ranging from very poor conditions in some regions to very good conditions in other regions
The hamlet heads made similar assessments of public services to village heads (Table 3.1.2)
Responses range from 19% who felt irrigation systems are sufficient to 55% who felt legal procedures are sufficient
Hamlet heads in the USDRP areas generally had the highest satisfaction rates for available public services, with the exception of irrigation systems, environmental management, and legal procedures, which received the highest satisfaction rates from hamlet heads in the ILGRP areas
As was the case with village heads, hamlet heads voted roads and clean water as both the most and the least sufficient public services
3.2 Access to Education Services 
Access to education services is measured using variables related to transportation to schools for students, such as modes of transportation, travel time, and daily transportation cost, disaggregated by the level of schooling
Table 3.2.1 shows that according to households respondents most students walk to school and that the proportion of students who walk to school decreases for increasing levels of education
Almost 80% of primary school students walk to school
This is due to the fact there are primary schools in almost every village
Across World Bank project areas, students in SPADA areas have the highest proportion of students who walk to school and students in USDRP areas have the lowest
This reflects the fact that there are more alternative modes of transportation for students in urban areas than in the disadvantaged rural areas
Travel time and the cost of transportation to school gradually increase for higher levels of education
On average, students spend 15 to 20 minutes in travel time to reach school
The average cost of transportation to school for those who pay for transportation is between Rp2,000 and Rp5,000 per day
Across World Bank project areas, students in SPADA areas have the longest travel times to school, while students in USDRP areas have the shortest
However, the cost of travel to school is highest in USDRP areas and lowest in SPADA areas
Again, this is due to the availability of better transportation facilities and infrastructure (i.e., roads) in urban areas compared to those in rural areas
This is also indicated by the relatively high proportion of students in USDRP areas who go to school by car (including public transportation such as bus, minibus, etc.) when compared to SPADA areas
This is another indication that the gap in the availability of transportation facilities between urban and rural areas is high
Figures 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 show the average number of students per school in each grade of primary and junior secondary schools during the academic years of 2003/2004, 2004/2005, and 2005/2006
Schools in the USDRP areas record the highest average number of students per school for both primary and secondary schools, while schools in SPADA areas record the lowest
Schools in urban areas tend to have multiple classes for each grade and generally have larger student numbers than schools in rural areas
This is due to the much higher population density in urban areas than in rural areas
Accessibility to education can also be measured by the proportion of school-aged household members who are enrolled in schools
Table 3.2.2 provides this measure for the primary, junior secondary, senior secondary, as well as overall education levels
The pattern of enrollment rates across education level follows the well-known national pattern of declining enrollment rates for increasing levels of education
However, the magnitudes of the enrollment rates are not directly comparable with the national rates as different calculation methods were used
The enrollment rates in this table were calculated at the household level and then averaged across all relevant households
While the national net enrollment rate at the primary level in recent years is reported at around 95%, the GDS2 data shows that the average enrollment rate at household level for primary education was only around 72%
Across all areas, possibly reflecting the near universal enrollment rate at the primary level, there were no significant differences in enrollment rates across World Bank project areas
Similarly at the junior secondary level, the differences in enrollment rates across areas were not large
However, at the senior secondary level there were large gaps between enrollment rates in the USDRP areas (39%) and those in SPADA and ILGRP areas (both 29%)
This points to the need to increase the supply of senior secondary education in rural areas and stimulate the demand for it
3.3 Access to Health Services 
The assessment of access to health services is also based on transportation matters, which include modes of transportation and travel time to health service providers
However, prior to the assessment, filtering information such as whether the respondent knew of the existence of the nearest health service provider was also assessed
Table 3.3.1 shows that respondents' awareness of the location of the nearest puskesmas (community health center) is much better than that for public hospitals
Eighty-three percent of households are aware of the location of their closest puskesmas, while only 61% are aware of the closest public hospital
This may be due to the shorter distance from people's homes to the puskesmas than to a public hospital, as puskesmas are generally available at the subdistrict (kecamatan) level, while a public hospital may only be found at the district (kabupaten) level or above
Awareness of other health providers is generally much lower than that of puskesmas and public hospitals
Awareness levels are consistent with other indicators such as modes of transportation and travel time to the nearest health service provider
For instance, the average travel time to a public hospital is more than one hour, while the average travel time to a puskesmas is only half an hour
In both cases, most people used cars or motorcycles to reach the facilities
However, to reach the lower-scale health service providers such as affiliate or secondary community health centers (pustu), village maternity posts (polindes), and mobile community health centers (puskesmas keliling), most people just walk
Across the project areas, the shortest travel time is generally found in USDRP areas, whereas the longest travel time is found in SPADA areas,
the differences in the available modes of transportation between the areas and the availability and quality of transport infrastructure such as roads
Aside from the access indicators, the data also provides the statistics of the last visit to health services and the most frequently visited health service provider
The figures are summarized in Tables 3.3.2 and 3.3.3
Table 3.3.2 indicates that 60% of households visited a health provider during the three months prior to the survey
Only 16% of households have not visited a health provider for more than 2 years
The pattern is similar across areas, suggesting that the demand for health services is quite high in all project areas
Among those who have visited a health provider during the last 2 years, 47% went to a puskesmas (including pustu, polindes, and puskesmas keliling), 39% went to a private health practitioner (physician, midwife, and nurse), 8% went to a public hospital, and 6% went to a private hospital or clinic
There are significant differences in the utilization of health providers across areas
Usage of puskesmas is highest in SPADA areas at 61%, and only 40% and 41% respectively in the ILGRP and USDRP areas
Usage of private hospitals and clinics was highest in the USDRP areas at 15% and lowest in the SPADA areas at just 3%
Similarly, usage of public hospitals was highest in the USDRP areas at 12%, and 7% and 8% respectively in the ILGRP and SPADA areas
Usage of private health practitioners was dominant in the ILGRP areas at 48%, much higher than in both the SPADA and USDRP areas at 28% and 32% respectively
This pattern of usage for health providers underscores the importance of puskesmas in delivering health services to the Indonesian population
Puskesmas are the dominant choice for households in rural areas, which may be due to the presence of puskesmas in most subdistricts, even down to the village level when pustu are included
But they are also used by a large proportion of households in urban areas
In contrast, hospitals, both public and private, are mostly utilized by urban households
This suggests that a gap in access to hospitals between urban and rural residents
When a patient visits a health provider, in most cases they are treated by a physician, a midwife, or a nurse
The table shows that on average, the proportions of patients treated by the three different types of medical persons at their last visit were similar, with 37% of patients treated by physicians, 32% by midwives, and 30% by nurses
However, there are sharp differences in this pattern across areas, in particular between USDRP (urban) and SPADA (rural) areas
In the USDRP areas, 69% of patients were treated by physicians and only 18% and 13% respectively were treated by midwives and nurses
In the SPADA areas, only 27% of patients were treated by physicians, while 34% and 39% respectively were treated by midwives and nurses
This clearly shows the existence of a large gap in access to medical doctors between urban and rural residents
Table 3.3.3 shows the health service providers most frequently visited by household respondents
The pattern is quite similar to the last visited health provider, both on average and for each type of area
However, the figures for hospitals, both public and private, indicate that a significantly lower proportion of households stated that a hospital was the most frequently visited health provider than those whose last visit to a health provider was to a hospital
Interestingly, the table shows similar proportions of households whose most frequently visited health provider is located within their village (52%) to those whose most frequently visited health provider is located outside their village (48%)
This pattern is similar across all areas
Table 3.3.4 provides the average number of puskesmas patients per day
The table shows that puskesmas treated an average of 38 patients each day
Around 34% of these patients were considered poor, but there were large differences across areas
In USDRP areas, puskesmas treat an average of 74 patients per day
This is more than double the daily patient numbers in SPADA (26) and ILGRP areas (31)
However, the proportion of poor patients is highest in the SPADA areas (45%) and lowest in the USDRP areas (29%)
This implies that the majority of puskesmas patients, particularly in urban areas, are not considered to be poor
Even in rural areas, less than half of puskesmas patients are poor
This indicates that access of the poor to puskesmas is still in need of improvement
One way to do this is by providing poor patients with subsidized transportation costs whenever they need to visit puskesmas for medical treatment
3.4 Village Administration Service The access to village service administration is assessed using variables related to people's experiences in obtaining an identity card (KTP)
All Indonesians aged 17 years and above are legally required to have a KTP
This identity card provides information on the legal residence of the beholder
It is often required as a proof of identity when dealing with various government institutions as well as private institutions (such as banks)
Some of the poor, however, do not have a KTP because they consider the cost of obtaining one to be too high
This can form an obstacle for the poor to benefit from various government programs, as a KTP is often a requirement for receiving benefits
The validity period of a KTP has recently been extended from 3 to 5 years
Table 3.4.1 shows that 61% of households have a member who has obtained a KTP during the past 2 years
Of these households, 74% claimed to be aware of the official procedure for obtaining a KTP
Nevertheless, the use of informal intermediaries (perantara) is prevalent in efforts to obtain a KTP, with around 47% of households having used them
The average length of time needed to obtain a KTP is 15 days
This indicates that the process of obtaining a KTP is not straightforward and may explain why many people opt to use an intermediary, even though they are aware of the official procedure
The proportion of households that have a member who has obtained a KTP during the past 2 years is similar across areas
However, the highest proportion of those who claimed to know the official procedure for obtaining a KTP was found in USDRP areas (83%) and the lowest in SPADA areas (72%)
Interestingly, similar percentages in both areas use informal intermediaries, at 39% and 38% respectively
In fact, the use of informal intermediaries is highest in ILGRP areas at 46%
The average length of time needed to obtain a KTP is highest in the SPADA areas at around 18 days or almost three weeks, while the lowest is in the USDRP areas at around 7.4 days or one week
Apparently, the use of informal intermediaries is not related to knowledge of the official procedure for obtaining a KTP
The areas with the highest and lowest proportions of people who claimed to know about the official procedure have the same incidence of the use of intermediaries
Furthermore, the use of intermediaries does not seem to speed up the process, as there is a very large difference in the time needed to complete the process of obtaining a KTP between the two areas with the same incidence of intermediary use
Table 3.4.2 provides more detail about the use of informal intermediaries in obtaining a KTP
Those who used informal intermediaries were asked to identify whether or not the cost of obtaining a KTP that they reported included the payment made to the intermediaries
In many cases people were asked to pay a lump sum by the intermediary, so they were not aware of how much they paid for the intermediary and how much they paid for the KTP
In other cases, however, people were asked to pay for the intermediary separately
The table indicates that the average cost of obtaining a KTP was Rp16,892, excluding payments for intermediaries
If payments for intermediaries are included, the cost increased to an average of Rp21,357, implying that the average payment to an intermediary was Rp4,465 or around 26% of the total cost
The average cost of obtaining a KTP, excluding payments for intermediaries, is highest in USDRP areas at Rp20,278 and lowest in SPADA areas at Rp18,766—a surprisingly low difference between urban and rural areas
Similarly, the average payment for an intermediary is highest in USDRP areas at Rp5,712 and lowest in ILGRP areas at Rp2,189
The relatively lower payment for intermediaries in ILGRP areas suggests that the high incidence of intermediary use in those areas is driven by a higher supply of intermediaries rather than higher demand from users
Furthermore, the table shows that most informal intermediaries are village officials, constituting 79% of all intermediaries
The next largest group of intermediaries is RT/RW/Dusun (community/neighborhood) officials, basically village officials, at 9%
This pattern, where officials make up around 90% of all informal intermediaries, is relatively consistent across areas
This clearly indicates that village and lower-level officials use the process of obtaining KTP as an opportunity to supplement their incomes
Table 3.4.3 shows the official procedure for obtaining a KTP as acknowledged by village heads (kepala desa/lurah) and hamlet heads (kepala dusun/kadus)
According to the village heads it takes 5 days on average to obtain a KTP, while according to the hamlet heads it takes 8 days
The difference perhaps can be explained by the time needed to transfer applications and KTP between the hamlet and the village
However, the actual time taken to obtain a KTP as shown in Table 3.4.1, was 15 days—three times longer than the official procedure as stated by the village heads
Unfortunately, all areas show a consistently large discrepancy between the official procedure and the people's actual experiences of obtaining a KTP
The responses of village and hamlet heads on the average cost of obtaining a KTP exhibit a similar difference
According to village heads, the average cost is Rp Rp12,896, while according to the hamlet heads the average cost was Rp16,245
Again, the difference can perhaps be explained by the cost of transferring applications and KTP between the hamlet and the village
The actual cost reported by households is Rp16,892 excluding payments for informal intermediaries, or 4% higher than the average official cost as stated by the hamlet heads
The differences between the actual and official cost of obtaining a KTP vary widely across areas
In the nonproject and SPADA areas, there is practically no difference between the actual and official cost
In the ILGRP and USDRP areas, however, the differences are 15% and 33% respectively
This suggests that profit-seeking activities are more prevalent in more urbanized areas
Both village heads and hamlet heads were asked whether village officials conduct activities to disseminate the official procedure for obtaining a KTP
Around 82% of village heads claimed that the officials in their villages did conduct dissemination activities, 
But only 58% of the hamlet heads confirmed this
This implies that a significant part of dissemination efforts are limited in their outreach, and perhaps are mostly delivered to the people who attend village offices to apply for a KTP
Based on the information from village heads, the proportion of villages which disseminate the official procedure for obtaining a KTP is highest in the ILGRP areas at almost 90% and lowest in the SPADA areas at around 75%
However, discrepancies with the information provided by hamlet heads are found in all areas, and are particularly large in SPADA and ILGRP areas
According to hamlet heads, 62% of people use intermediaries when they need to obtain a KTP
This figure is significantly higher than actual incidence reported by households in Table 4.3.1, which is only 47%
The discrepancy could indicate different understandings about who are considered to be intermediaries, particularly as most intermediaries are village officials
This phenomenon occurs in all areas, but is greatest in SPADA areas, where the discrepancy reaches 26 percentage points
3.5 Access to Information 
The indicator of access to information is measured mostly at the village level, by examining the public accessibility of information regarding the village budget and development programs and also people's awareness of the existence of the village representative body (BPD or DK) in their villages
This village-level indicator is complemented by household knowledge of updated information at the district and national levels as well as the media that is used to access the information
Table 3.5.1 shows that only 15% of households have received information related to the village budget and that only 25% have received information related to village development programs
The relatively low proportion of villagers who are informed about these village matters is common, with little difference across the World Bank project areas
Apparently, in the year prior to the survey, most villages do not socialize their budgets and programs to their most important stakeholders—the villagers
Furthermore, this indicates that participatory planning and budgeting practices are still far from being a reality in most villages
Awareness of the existence of BPD/DK (48% of households) is better than the two previous indicators
Interestingly, more people in rural areas know of the existence of BPD/DK than in urban areas
This is shown by the fact that in SPADA areas more than 57% of households are aware of the BPD/DK, compared to only 26% of households in USDRP areas
BPD/DK, as the lowest-level representative body, seem to be reasonably responsive to the people they represent
Of the people who are aware that BPD/DK exist, 41% also know of complaints or criticisms directed towards the BPD/DK during the previous year
In these cases, around 74% of households advised that the BPD/DK responded to the complaint or criticism
The incidence of complaints or criticisms directed at BPD/DK in the past year seems to be highest in SPADA areas
Forty-five percent of households in SPADA areas are aware of such complaints or criticisms, while the proportions in ILGRP and USDRP areas are only 38% and 39% respectively
However, BPD/DK seem to be more responsive in the urban and semiurban areas
When complaints or criticisms have arisen, 81% of households in USDRP areas and 80% in ILGRP areas stated that the BPD/DK addressed the issues, while the figure in the SPADA areas is only 72%
In terms of following updated information, in general more households follow updated national information (42%) than district information (35%)
SPADA areas are the exception, where more people follow updated district information (28%) than national information (26%)
Not surprisingly, USDRP areas have the highest proportion of households that follow updated information at both the national (65%) and district (50%) levels
The most popular media used to access information is television (76%), followed by radio (39%) and local newspapers (19%)
Only 10% of households access information through national newspapers and less than 1% of households use the internet
Even in USDRP (urban) areas only 4% of households use the internet
Table 3.5.2 provides village head perspectives on the accessibility of information
A comparison with household perspectives indicates that information accessibility at the village level is much higher than the proportions of households that actually access the information
For example, even though 97% of villages are able to access radio broadcasts, only 39% of households listen to the radio for updated information
A similar trend emerged for other media such as television and newspapers
Even for village information such as the village budget, while 90% of village heads claim to have disseminated the budget, only 15% of households are aware of their village budgets
This situation is prevalent across all areas
3.6 Police Services In Indonesia, police services have not been decentralized
Nevertheless, as police services provide an important service to people at the local level, they have been included in the GDS2 assessment of public services
Table 3.6.1 shows household assessments of police services
In the 2 years prior to the survey, 19% of households have accessed police services
USDRP areas have the highest proportion of households that have accessed police services (32%), while SPADA areas have the lowest proportion (10%)
This indicates that there is a higher demand for police services in urban areas than in rural areas or that police services are more difficult to access in rural areas
Of those households who have accessed police services in the past 2 years, 29% were asked to pay "settlement money", a euphemism for a bribe
The highest incidence of bribe-taking also occurred in USDRP areas (39%) and the lowest occurred in SPADA areas (27%)
Apparently the higher demand for police services in urban areas has led to a higher incidence of bribe-taking, perhaps to speed up processes for individuals to enable them to jump the queue
Forty-eight percent of households acknowledged that they have seen the police visiting their communities whilst on duty
This incidence of community policing is similar across almost all areas
Fifteen percent of households have a member who has obtained a driving license in the past 2 years, implying that around 80% of households that accessed police services in that time did so in order to obtain a driving license
This phenomenon is similar across areas
Around 80% of households claim to know the official procedure for obtaining a driving license, with equally high proportions across all areas
The average length of time taken to obtain a driving license is similar across areas at around 2 to 3 days, except in SPADA areas, where it takes 6 days on average
One factor that can help explain the differences in the time needed to obtain a driving license is the use of informal intermediaries
However, this factor cannot explain all or even a large part of the differences, as the use of intermediaries in SPADA and ILGRP areas does not differ significantly
In general, 36% of households used intermediaries when obtaining a driving license
The use of intermediaries is highest in the USDRP areas at 48%, while in the SPADA and ILGRP areas the figures are only 26% and 28% respectively
Around 80% of the intermediaries were police officers
This phenomenon is similar across all areas
The official tariff for acquiring a new driving license is Rp75,000, while the tariff for a driving license renewal is Rp60,000
In addition, a driving license applicant is required to take a medical test costing approximately Rp50,000
Hence, in total, the official cost for obtaining a new driving license is Rp125,000 and about Rp110,000 for a license renewal
However, the survey findings show a huge discrepancy between the official cost and the actual cost paid by driving license applicants
The actual average cost paid by an applicant to obtain a driving license, not including the payment for an intermediary, was Rp193,327, which is 55% higher than the official cost
If the payment for an intermediary is included, the total cost increased to Rp235,353, implying that the payment to an intermediary on average was Rp42,026, which is equal to 34% of the official cost
This means that the total cost paid by a driving license applicant if an informal intermediary is employed is almost 90% higher than the official cost
If an intermediary was not employed, the highest average cost of obtaining a driving license was reported in SPADA areas, at Rp229,063 or 83% higher than the official cost
The lowest average cost was found in the USDRP areas, at Rp170,400 or 36% higher than the official cost
If an intermediary was employed, the highest average payment for the intermediary was found in USDRP areas, at Rp121,770 or 97% of the official cost, while the lowest was in the SPADA areas, at Rp25,384 or 20% of the official cost
Recalling that USDRP areas have the highest incidence of the use of intermediaries and SPADA areas have the lowest, it seems that the very high payments for intermediaries in USDRP areas are mostly driven by a high demand for their services
3.7 Conflict and Securities 
The GDS2 questionnaire asked respondents about disputes and conflicts that have occurred in their village during the 2 years prior to the survey
Tables 3.7.1 and 3.7.2 respectively show household and village head perspectives on disputes and conflicts that have occurred in their village
Interestingly, village heads reported two to three times more incidences of disputes and conflicts than households reported
It is quite plausible that village heads know more about disputes and conflicts that have occurred in their village than households
However, household satisfaction with dispute and conflict resolutions was also much lower than that of the village heads
Households and village heads agreed on the three most important issues causing disputes and conflicts, although they differed on the share of total conflicts that these issues caused
According to households, the three types of disputes and conflicts that occurred most frequently were related to crime (16%), land or building issues (13%), and marriage, divorce, or inheritance (11%)
Village heads stated that the three most frequently occurring types of disputes and conflicts were related to land or building issues (41%), crime (36%), and marriage, divorce, or inheritance (36%)
Across areas, from the household accounts, the highest incidence of the three most prevalent types of disputes and conflicts occurred in ILGRP areas
According to village heads, these types of disputes and conflicts mostly occurred in USDRP areas
In general, the majority of both households and village heads are satisfied with the resolutions of disputes and conflicts that had occurred in their village
Household dissatisfaction with the resolution of cases of disputes and conflicts stemming from abuse of power or authority is an exception
Generally, village heads have a higher rate of satisfaction with dispute and conflict resolution than households
The indicators for security are measured from the responses to questions about security from physical threats and violence and security for valuable assets ownership
Respondents were asked to assess the current security level and compare it with the situation 2 years ago
Table 3.7.3 shows that for both security indicators, more than 80% of households felt secure at the time of the study and more than 60% felt that the security level had increased from 2 years previously
This is true for all areas
3.8 Participation and Social Capital 
Participation here is assessed by looking at the participation of household members in the PKPS-BBM Village Infrastructure (IP) activities and comparing current participation levels in any village programs or activities with that of 2 years ago
Table 3.8.1 shows that the proportion of households which are aware that their village received the PKPS-BBM IP is relatively low, at 23%
The highest proportion is found in SPADA areas (33%) and the lowest in ILGRP areas (20%)
Thirty-three percent of those who are aware of the program have participated
The highest participation rate is found in the SPADA areas (42%) and the lowest in USDRP areas (22%)
Approximately one-half of households stated that their level of participation in village activities had remained the same as 2 years ago, while around one-third feel that their participation has increased
Ten percent of households said that their participation has decreased
These proportions are similar across all areas
A descriptive analysis of social trust shows some expected patterns
Table 3.8.2 shows that people have the highest level of trust in people from their own neighborhood (RT)
At this smallest community unit, more than 90% of households trust either everyone or at least the majority of people
Around 70% of households trust everyone or most of the people within their wider village community, and around 60% of households trust all or most of the people of a different religion or ethnicity
But there are significant differences across areas
The highest levels of social trust are consistently found in SPADA areas
This clearly indicates that people in the rural areas tend to have higher levels of trust in each other
The levels of trust in people from within a respondent's own neighborhood and village are higher in ILGRP areas than in USDRP areas
Conversely, levels of trust of people of a different religion or ethnicity are higher in USDRP areas than in ILGRP areas
3.9 Politics 
The assessment of political aspects is measured using several variables, from general issues such as knowledge about political leaders at the national, district, and village levels, to issues related to the most recent election for district head
Table 3.9.1 shows that knowledge of the name of the speaker of the national parliament is very low
only 11% of households knew his name
The lowest percentage is found in SPADA areas (8%) and the highest in USDRP areas (26%)
Similarly, only 13% of households knew the name of the speaker of their local parliament, with the highest rate found in SPADA areas (17%) and the lowest in USDRP areas (8%)
The executives fared better
In all areas, more than 35% of households knew the name of their governor and around 60% of households knew the name of their district head
Knowledge of village heads is particularly high in SPADA and ILGRP areas, at 94% and 87% respectively
In USDRP areas, however, only 53% of households knew the name of their village head
In areas where there had been an election for district head in the year leading up to the survey, participation in the local elections was quite high, with around 94% of households having voted
The proportion is slightly lower in USDRP areas at 87%
Unfortunately, only 44% of those who voted knew about the background of the candidates
In all areas, most of those who voted put emphasis on the candidates' programs and experiences when considering who to vote for
In general, ethnicity and religion does not play a prominent role in determining voting patterns
ILGRP areas are the exception, where a relatively large proportion of voters considered these two aspects
Most of those who abstained did so due to administrative or logistical problems
Only around one-fifth of those who did not vote genuinely had no interest in doing so
IV
GOVERNANCE 
4.1 Transparency and Information Education Services 
The indicator used to measure transparency and information in education institutions is whether or not the school principal or school committee disseminate information about the school fees and other costs that parents are required to pay
In addition, in the recent PKPSBBM for the education sector, schools received grants through a program called school operational assistance (BOS)
In the survey, parents were asked if they were aware of the BOS allocation for their children's schools and whether or not the grant has led to the reduction or abolishment of school fees
Table 4.1.1 shows that transparency at education institutions is low, particularly for information related to school costs and financing
Only one-third of parents have received information about the school fees and other costs that they are required to pay
In ILGRP and USDRP areas, the proportions are notably lower at 26% and 28% respectively
SPADA areas have a slightly higher rate of 35%
Based on the results of the data analysis, almost all schools receive BOS funds
However, only 71% of parents stated that their children's schools receives BOS funds
The proportions do not differ much across regions, but range from 69% in USDRP areas to 75% in ILGRP areas
Only 64% of the parents who know that their children's school receives BOS funds stated that the funds have led to the reduction or abolishment of school fees
The lowest proportion is found in SPADA areas at only 59%, and the highest in USDRP areas at 70%
It is ironic that the BOS program has its lowest level of achievement in the most disadvantaged areas
Table 4.1.2 provides assessments from district education offices (Dinas Pendidikan kabupaten/kota) on their own transparency and the information they provide to the public
It is perhaps not too surprising that they consider themselves to be highly transparent and as having provided sufficient information to the public
The proportion of education offices which consider themselves to be transparent in every aspect that was evaluated is higher than 88% in all areas; in USDRP areas the proportions always reached 100%
Table 4.1.3 shows household perspectives on the transparency of their District Education Office and the information they provide
Only 11% of household respondents reported that they have criticized, offered suggestions to, or made complaints about education services in the last 2 years
The proportions do not differ much across areas, with the highest in USDRP areas (13%) and the lowest in SPADA areas (10%)
Of those who have criticized, offered suggestions, or made a complaint, 59% are satisfied with the response they received
The highest satisfaction rate is in ILGRP areas (73%) and the lowest in SPADA areas (57%)
Among those who have not criticized, offered suggestions to, or made complaints about education services in the last 2 years, only around 25% know of any official or unofficial channels they can use to do so
Knowledge about complaint channels is highest in the USDRP areas at 44% and lowest in SPADA areas at 17%
Health Services District health offices (Dinas Kesehatan Kabupaten/Kota) were also questioned about their transparency and the information they provide to the public
Like district education offices, they consider themselves to be highly transparent and as having provided sufficient information to the public
Table 4.1.4 shows that in every aspect evaluated, the proportion of district health offices which consider themselves to be transparent is always higher than 81%
All of the district health offices in USDRP areas consider themselves to be transparent and as having provided enough information to the public
The lowest proportion of district health offices which consider themselves to be transparent are found in SPADA areas
The proportion of users or clients that have criticized, offered suggestions to, or made complaints about health services in last 2 years is even lower than that for education services
Table 4.1.5 shows that overall only 6.5% of households have criticized, offered suggestions to, or complained about health services in the last 2 years
Of those, 55% are satisfied with the health service provider's response
The rate of satisfaction is similar across most areas with the exception of SPADA areas (49%)
Of those who have not criticized, offered suggestions to, or made complaints about education services in the last 2 years, only 21% know of any official or unofficial channels they can use to do so
Knowledge of complaint channels is particularly low in SPADA areas, at only 13%, but relatively high in the USDRP areas, at 45%
Village Administration The analysis of the transparency of village administration services and the information they provide is also based on user experiences in delivering their criticisms, suggestions, or complaints
Table 4.1.6 indicates that a low proportion of people have criticized, offered suggestions to, or complained about village administration services in the last 2 years, at around 10% of households
This figure is fairly equal across all areas
Among those who have criticized, offered suggestions, or made complaints, 55% are satisfied with the response they received from village officials
This satisfaction rate is similar across areas, with the exception of USDRP areas where it was slightly higher at 62%
Of those who have not criticized, offered suggestions to, or complained about village administration services in the last 2 years, 29% are aware of the official or other unofficial channels they can do this through
Knowledge of complaint channels is low in SPADA areas at 20%, but much higher in USDRP areas at 47%
Police Services The assessment of the transparency of police services is also based on the experiences of household respondents in delivering criticisms, suggestions, or complaints to police services
Table 4.1.7 clearly shows that the proportion of people who have criticized, offered suggestions to, or complained about police services in the last 2 years is very low—less than 3% of households overall
The rate is consistently low across all areas, and is the lowest rate of all the public services assessed
However, of the very few who did dare to criticize, offer suggestions to, or complain about police services, approximately one-half were satisfied with the response from the police
The satisfaction rate is also similar across areas, with the highest in SPADA areas at 54% and the lowest in ILGRP areas at 42%
Of those who have not criticized, offered suggestions to, or complained about police services in the last 2 years, 22% are aware of the official or other unofficial channels to do this through
Knowledge of complaint channels for police services is lowest in SPADA areas at only 15% and highest in USDRP areas at 40%
4.2 Corruption An important indicator for governance aside from transparency is the extent of corruption
Household respondents were asked about their knowledge of cases of corruption and bribery that may have occurred in institutions providing education, health, village administration, and police services in the 2 years prior to the survey
Table 4.2.1 shows that very few people admitted to being aware of cases of corruption or bribery cases in the relevant institutions
The most commonly acknowledged form of corruption or bribery is bribery occurring at police institutions, with 19% of households claiming to know of cases in the 2 years prior to the survey
Corruption at village offices followed, at 9%
Education institutions are not free from illegal transactions either
A maximum of 9% of households are aware of cases of corruption and bribery combined that have taken place at education institutions
Comparing World Bank project areas, the table indicates that the highest proportion of households that are aware of corruption and bribery cases is found in USDRP areas, while the lowest proportion of people who are aware of these illegal activities is found in SPADA areas
V
SERVICE DELIVERY AT EDUCATION AND HEALTH FACILITIES
5.1 Provision of Services and their Costs Education Services 
Table 5.1.1 provides household assessments on the delivery of education services
Household respondents were first asked to compare the current state of education services with that of 2 years ago
covering the condition of school buildings and facilities, teachers' attention toward students, the costs of schooling, student learning achievements, extracurricular activities, and overall education services
Respondents were then asked about their level of satisfaction with the current state of education services
Finally, they were asked to point out any aspects of education services that require improvement
The overall assessment is quite positive
Seventy-one percent of households feel that overall education services are better now than they were 2 years prior to the survey
This positive assessment is prevalent across all areas, with the highest in ILGRP areas (76%) and the lowest in SPADA areas (67%)
More than 60% of households assessed the condition of school buildings and facilities, teachers' attention toward their students, and schooling costs as having improved in the last 2 years, and 58% and 47% of households respectively assessed student learning achievements and extracurricular activities as having improved
These relatively positive assessments on various aspects of education services are fairly consistent across all areas
In line with the positive assessment of the different aspects of education services, around 80% of households across all areas are either satisfied or fairly satisfied with the current overall education services
Nevertheless, four major aspects are consistently thought to be in need of improvement
student learning achievements (29%), condition of school buildings and facilities (27%), teacher attention toward their students (17%), and affordability of the costs of education services (8%)
The quality of services provided often correlates with the cost of accessing the services
Table 5.1.2 shows the average cost of schooling for each level of education disaggregated by its components, which include admission/renewal fees, monthly school committee fees, and the cost of textbooks and stationary
As expected, all components of school costs increase with the level of schooling
Comparing areas, the highest costs of schooling for all levels of education and components of schooling costs were reported in USDRP areas, while the lowest were reported in SPADA areas
In fact, the costs of schooling in USDRP areas are around four times as high as those in SPADA areas
However, considering that household satisfaction with education services is similar across areas, it is not clear whether these very high cost differentials reflect any difference in the quality of education
Health Services As with education services, household assessments of health service delivery are based on three questions
Firstly, household respondents were asked to compare the current state of their most frequently visited health service provider with that of 2 years ago
The physical condition of the health service provider, the cost of medical services, the availability of medicines and vaccines stock, as well as overall medical services were all compared
Respondents were then asked about their level of satisfaction with the current state of health services
Finally, they were asked to point out the aspects of health services that require improvement
Table 5.1.3 shows household assessments of health service delivery
The overall assessment is positive; 71% of household respondents think that health services have improved over the past 2 years
This positive assessment is similar across areas, with the highest in USDRP areas (74%) and the lowest in SPADA areas (63%)
The physical condition of health service provider and the availability of medicine and vaccine stocks were also assessed as having improved from 2 years before by 74% and 66% of respondents respectively, while 55% of respondents feel that medical services have become more affordable
These fairly positive assessments are similar across all areas
Around 90% of household respondents across all areas are either satisfied or fairly satisfied with the current state of health services
Nevertheless, five major aspects are consistently thought to require improvement
availability of medicine and vaccine stock (24%), affordability of medical services (20%), the physical condition of health service provider (19%), attention from medical personnel and their caring attitude (15%), and waiting times (7%)
Table 5.1.4 provides the charges for various services at puskesmas and private health services
The table shows that the charges at puskesmas are relatively low, none being higher than Rp10,000 (around US$1.10)
This reflects the fact that puskesmas receive a number of government subsidies
The charges at private health providers are generally much higher
Due to great variation in the classes of private health providers, however, the standard deviations for the means are large
5.2 Staff Availability 
The quantity and quality of human resources are important factors in determining the quality of services
Therefore, it is important to assess the availability of staff in the delivery of services
Education Services Most teachers are civil servants (PNS)
Table 5.2.1 shows that according to school principals, 74% of teachers are civil servants
The highest proportion of civil servant teachers is found in USDRP areas (80%) and the lowest in SPADA areas (71%)
Forty-seven percent of school principals consider that they have an adequate number of teachers in their school; however this number falls to only 36% in SPADA areas
This perhaps reflects the general preference of teachers to be stationed in urban areas than in rural and disadvantaged areas
In terms of quality, 66% of school principals stated teaching quality in their schools is adequate
The highest proportion is found in ILGRP areas (78%) and the lowest in SPADA areas (55%)
The assessments of teaching quality do not correlate with the average length of teaching experience (14 years)
whilst the lowest average number of teaching years is found in SPADA areas at 13 years
as the highest percentage of school principals in ILGRP areas stated that teaching quality in their school is adequate, teachers in ILGRP areas are the most experienced
Teachers in USDRP areas tend to have the most teaching experience, with 17 years on average
Another indicator of the quality of services delivery in education is teacher workload
The average number of teaching hours is 23 hours per week, or less than four hours per day, and is similar across areas
With such a low teaching load, theoretically teachers should have enough time for preparing and improving teaching materials and methods
Health Services Health providers employ various categories of staff
The first part of Table 5.2.2 provides the data on staff availability at puskesmas
The second part of the table summarizes district health office perceptions of the adequacy of medical staff within each district
The first part of the table shows that the availability of both medical and administrative staff at puskesmas is notably high
In general the percentages are higher than 90%, except for dental services staff (87%), and is fairly even across areas
However, it is important to note that staff availability in this table indicates if the puskesmas has at least one staff member for each service post, regardless of the number of staff that are actually needed
The same is true for staff qualification
Therefore, the high percentage of staff availability does not reflect staffing adequacy in terms of either quantity or quality
The district health office assessments of medical staff adequacy show a more complete picture of staff availability in the health sector
Medical staff are categorized into three groups
doctor/physician, midwife, and nurse
The table shows that only 45% of district health offices are of the opinion that their district has enough doctors, 33% stated that their district has enough midwives, and 41% stated that their district has enough nurses
The proportions are higher in USDRP areas, but significantly lower in SPADA and ILGRP areas
5.3 Condition of Facilities Education Facilities 
Table 5.3.1 shows the proportion of facilities at primary schools (SD) and junior secondary schools (SMP) that were evaluated as being in good condition
The information in the table is based on school data and complemented by the direct observation of survey interviewers
Facilities at junior secondary schools are generally better than those at primary schools
Comparing areas, schools in USDRP areas tended to have the highest proportion of facilities in good condition, while schools in SPADA areas had the lowest proportion
The discrepancies are particularly large for facilities such as computer laboratories, libraries, school health units, counseling rooms, student and teacher toilets, sports grounds, classroom walls and roofs, and lighting
Health Facilities Table 5.3.2 shows the proportion of facilities in good condition at puskesmas and private health service providers
In general, the proportion of facilities in good condition both at puskesmas and private health service providers are relatively high
However, only 60% of puskesmas have toilets which were in good condition, while the figure stand at 78% for private health service providers
Only 65% of private health service providers have medicine stockrooms in good condition
The proportion of facilities in good condition does not differ much across areas 
But very few puskesmas in USDRP areas had electricity generators
This may indicate that the supply of electricity in urban areas is reasonably reliable
5.4 Availability of Medicines, Vaccines, and Contraceptives at Puskesmas 
Medicine Stock Availability 
The availability of medicine stock is disaggregated by the type of medicines that puskesmas usually provide
Based on their indications, this includes medicines for diarrhea (antidiarrhea medicines and oralit), malaria (antimalarials, Chloroquine, and Sulfadoxin), antibiotics for acute respiratory infection and general infections (Co-trimoxazole syrup and Co-trimoxazole 480 mg), analgesics (paracetamol syrup), antituberculosis (common TBC, category 1, and anti- TBC for children), and mineral supplements for pregnant women (iron/Fe pill)
The availability of these medicines at the time of the survey was quite high in all areas
In general, more than 80% of puskesmas had these medicines in stock
An exception to this was malarial drugs (antimalarials, Chloroquine, and Sulfadoxin) in USDRP areas, but this may be due to the low prevalence of malaria in urban areas
Stock shortages are rare across all areas, except for the syrup forms of Co-trimoxazole and paracetamol
Furthermore, shortages that do occur are generally not prolonged, tending to last from 1 to 12 weeks
Vaccine Stock Availability BCG, Polio, Measles, and Hepatitis B vaccines are usually available at puskesmas
These vaccines were readily available across all areas, and were in stock at 90% or more of puskesmas at the time of the survey
The lowest level of availability (79%) was for Hepatitis B vaccine in USDRP areas, but 19% of puskesmas in the sample admitted that Hepatitis B vaccine had been out of stock at some point in the 3 months prior to the survey
However, the shortages generally only lasted for short periods, ranging from 2 to 6 weeks
Contraceptives Stock Availability The contraceptives usually available at puskesmas are the pill, injection, implants, IUD, and condoms
Contraceptive availability was relatively high across all areas, except for implants, which were only in stock at 52% of puskesmas
This may due to the low number of contraceptive implant users
Several puskesmas had experienced a lack of contraceptive stocks in the three months prior to the survey, with the lowest number of shortages for condoms (6%) and the highest for implants (25%)
The highest incidence of contraceptive stock shortages occurred in SPADA areas and the lowest in USDRP areas
The shortages are generally not prolonged, ranging between 4 and 10 weeks on average, however shortages are generally more prolonged in ILGRP and SPADA areas
5.5 Minimum Standards of Service (MSS) 
Only district health offices were asked questions regarding minimum standards of service (MSS)
Table 5.5.1 shows that only 53% of districts in the sample have met the minimum standards of service set by the central government
The highest proportion of these districts is found in ILGRP areas (62%) and the lowest in USDRP areas (40%)
However, the 40% of districts in USDRP areas that have met the standards have already issued local regulations related to the MSS, while less than 10% of districts in other areas have done so
Very few puskesmas have the resources required to meet the MSS; in fact, not even one puskesmas in USDRP areas has been able to meet the standards
However, 20% of districts in USDRP areas have regulated a sanction for puskesmas that fail to meet the MSS, while only 6% of districts in SPADA areas and none in ILGRP areas have done so
5.6 School Outcomes 
The survey measures school outcomes by the proportion of students who successfully graduate
Table 5.6.1 shows that the overall primary school (SD) graduation rate was 96% and only slightly lower (94%) at the junior secondary school (SMP) level
Graduation rates for female students are slightly higher than for male students
Across areas, the SD graduation rate is lowest in USDRP areas at only 89%, while it reaches 97% in other areas
The lowest SMP graduation rate is found in SPADA areas at 93%, while it reaches 97% in other areas
VI
ACCOUNTABILITY OF HEALTH AND EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS 
6.1 Involvement of Health and Education Institution Heads in Decisionmaking Processes Education Institutions Schools 
This section assesses school principal involvement in the decision-making processes for the determination of their school's vision and mission, the curriculum used in the school, and the reference books used for teaching at both the primary and junior secondary schools, based on information provided by school principals
It also assesses their involvement in the decisionmaking processes for the recruitment of temporary teachers, the selection of participants for teacher capacity building training, and the determination of teacher evaluation criteria, based on information provided by district education offices
Table 6.1.1 shows a high level of school principal involvement in the determination of a school's vision and mission in both primary and junior secondary schools, at 94% and 97% respectively
The proportions are similar across areas, with the highest recorded in USDRP areas at 97% and the lowest in SPADA areas at 90%
However, the involvement rates are much lower for the determination of school curriculum and reference books
Only 42% of primary school principals are involved in the determination of school curriculum and 54% in the determination of reference books
However, there are large variations across areas
In the determination of school curriculum, the highest proportion of districts involving the principal is in SPADA areas (46%) and the lowest in USDRP areas (33%)
In the determination of reference books, the highest proportion is found in USDRP areas (70%) and the lowest in SPADA areas (48%)
In junior secondary schools, only 65% of school principals are involved in the determination of school curriculum and 48% in the determination of reference books
As in the case of primary schools, these figures vary across the areas
The highest level of involvement in the determination of school curriculum is found in ILGRP areas (77%) and the lowest in SPADA areas (63%)
In the determination of reference books, the highest rate is found in SPADA areas (55%) and the lowest in USDRP areas (40%)
School principal involvement in the recruitment of temporary teachers is relatively low
Only 31% of school principals have a say in this decision
The proportions are even lower in USDRP and ILGRP areas at only 20% and 23% respectively
School principals have a greater role in the determination of participants for teacher capacity upgrading, with 66% involved in the decision
In USDRP areas the proportion is as high as 80%
In determining teacher evaluation criteria, 61% of school principals are involved
This proportion is similar across areas
Health Institutions
Puskesmas This section assesses the involvement of puskesmas heads in decision-making processes to determine various health-related decisions at both the puskesmas and district levels
Table 6.1.2 shows that according to their own accounts, puskesmas head involvement in the determination of service charges is relatively low, with only 32% of puskesmas heads involved in the decision-making process
There is a large variation across areas
the highest rate of involvement being in USDRP areas at 45% and the lowest in SPADA areas at only 24%
However, according to the information from district health offices, 76% of districts involve puskesmas heads in the decision-making process
In fact, all districts in the USDRP areas reported that they involve puskesmas heads in the determination of service charges, while 71% of districts in SPADA areas reported they do so
In districts where the collection targets for service charges are determined by district health offices 
a large number (86%) of puskesmas heads are involved in the target determination
This figure is highest in USDRP areas (100%) and lowest in SPADA areas (78%)
According to puskesmas heads, 48% are involved in the determination of beneficiaries for the Fuel Subsidy Reduction Compensation Program for the Health Sector (PKPS-BBM BK)
ILGRP areas recorded the highest rate of involvement (55%) and USDRP areas the lowest (45%)
Their rate of involvement in the determination of puskesmas service charges is generally lower, at 32%
In the districts which have MSS for health, 63% of puskesmas heads are involved in the creation of the MMS
The highest figure is found in USDRP areas (69%) and the lowest is found in SPADA areas (61%)
According to district health offices, the involvement of puskesmas heads in the recruitment of medical doctors including temporary doctors (both those paid by the central government and those paid by the local governments), is quite low at less than 24%
In fact, only 16% of districts involve puskesmas heads in the recruitment of temporary doctors who are paid by local\ governments
USDRP areas differed significantly from other areas; 60% of USDRP districts claimed that they accommodate the participation of puskesmas heads in the decision-making process regarding the recruitment of all categories of doctor
6.2 Final Decision-making Education Institutions
Schools Table 6.2.1 shows the role of school principals as the final decision-maker in matters related to their job
The proportions of school principals who are the final decision-makers in the determination of admission criteria for new students at both primary and junior secondary schools are very low, at only 7% and 6% respectively
These low proportions are similar across areas, with the highest in ILGRP areas (10% and 7% for the primary and junior secondary schools respectively), and the lowest in USDRP areas (only 4% at both levels)
Similarly, at the district level, not many school principals are the final decision-makers in the recruitment of temporary teachers and the determination of participants for teacher capacity building, with only 5% of districts allowing school principals make the final decision in these cases across all areas and none at all in SPADA districts
However, in USDRP areas, 60% of districts allow school principals to make the final decision regarding the recruitment of temporary teachers
Eighteen percent of districts allow school principals make the final decision regarding the determination of teacher evaluation criteria
Across areas, the highest number is found in ILGRP areas (31%), and the lowest in SPADA areas (17%)
Health Institutions
Puskesmas Table 6.2.2 shows the role of puskesmas heads as the final decision-makers in matters related to their job
As is the case with school principals, according to their own accounts, very few puskesmas heads are authorized to make final decisions
In the determination of puskesmas service charges, less than 5% of puskesmas heads make the final decision, and none in either ILGRP or USDRP areas have this role
The figure is 9% in SPADA areas
However, according to the information from district health offices, 12% of districts allow puskesmas heads to adjust the service charges at their puskesmas
Across World Bank project areas, the highest proportion is found in USDRP areas (40%) and the lowest in SPADA areas (12%)
In general, very few districts allow puskesmas heads to make the final decision regarding the recruitment of doctors
None of the districts in ILGRP and USDRP areas give this role to puskesmas heads, and in SPADA areas, only 6% of districts allow puskesmas heads the final say on the recruitment of permanent doctors, 3% of districts on the recruitment of temporary doctors, and 12% of districts on the recruitment of temporary doctors paid by local government
VII
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RECENT GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS 
Respondents were asked about the implementation of several recent government programs which form the components of the Fuel Subsidy Reduction Compensation Program (PKPSBBM)
The questionnaire covered the Unconditional Cash Transfer (SLT), PKPS-BBM for the health sector (PKPS-BBM BK, also known as Health Insurance for Poor Families (Askeskin)), School Operational Assistance (BOS), and PKPS-BBM for village infrastructure (PKPS-BBM IP)
These programs are managed by the central government and have national coverage
The survey data from 139 districts, however, shows that some districts were reported as not being covered by the PKPS-BBM programs in health, education (BOS), and village infrastructure
Table 7.1 provides information on poor families, which are usually referred to as gakin (keluarga miskin), and is based on information provided by village heads
The table shows that quite a high proportion of families in villages are considered to be poor, at 44% on average
This is much higher than the official national poverty rate in 2006, which stood at less than 18%
Across areas, villages in SPADA areas have the highest average incidence of poor families (56%), while the lowest average incidence is found in the USDRP areas (20%)
This is to be expected, given SPADA areas are disadvantaged, left-behind rural areas while USDRP areas are urban
During 2005, 95% of all villages in the sample were covered by government programs with benefits targeted toward poor families
This figure reached 100% in USDRP areas
Some of these programs require beneficiaries to obtain a letter of recommendation for the poor (SKTM) from village heads confirming that they are indeed poor families
During 2005, almost all (94%) village heads issued such letters
This figure was lowest in SPADA areas (88%)
7.1 The Unconditional Cash Transfer (SLT) Program 
The Unconditional Cash Transfer (SLT) program provided a direct transfer of Rp100,000 per month to beneficiary households for a period of 12 months, starting from the last quarter of 2005 and finishing in the third quarter of 2006
The cash was distributed to the beneficiary households quarterly through the post office
SLT beneficiaries were selected based on the 2005 household socioeconomic survey (PSE05) conducted by Statistics Indonesia (BPS), using a proxy means testing method
Approximately 15.5 million households were initially selected as program beneficiaries
Due to strong protests from households which consider themselves to be poor but that were not included in the program, the number of beneficiaries was increased to 19.2 million households for the second and following disbursements
Beneficiary Socioeconomic Characteristics Table 7.1.1 provides a description of the socioeconomic characteristics of SLT beneficiary households in order to give a better understanding of who received the program benefit
Comparing this table with tables 2.4.1 to 2.4.3, it is clear that most of the means of SLT beneficiary household socioeconomic characteristics are lower than the mean for all households, confirming that SLT beneficiaries are generally poorer than the general population
For example, the proportion of households headed by women among SLT beneficiaries is almost double that for the entire household sample
The proportion of SLT beneficiary household heads with only a primary education is also much higher than in the entire household sample
Table 7.1.1 also provides the 14 indicators that were used to determine SLT beneficiaries in PSE05
Among these indicators, the most common are 
(i) using charcoal or kerosene as cooking fuel, (ii) consuming meat at most once in a week, and (iii) the household head having a primary education or less
The occurrence of these top three indicators is similar across areas
The survey also asked SLT beneficiaries to make a self-assessment of their household's economic welfare
The results are presented in Table 7.1.2
According to poverty status, there are three groups of SLT beneficiaries
(i) the very poor (those with household expenditure below Rp125,000 per capita per month); (ii) the poor (those with household expenditure between Rp125,000 and Rp150,000 per capita per month); and (iii) the near poor (those with household expenditure between Rp150,000 and Rp175,000 per capita per month)
The table indicates that most SLT beneficiaries fall into the very poor and poor categories
As expected, the average monthly per capita expenditure in USDRP areas is substantially higher than that in SPADA and ILGRP areas
This is consistent with the subjective household assessments of their poverty status
Around 90% of SLT beneficiaries consider themselves to be very poor or poor, while 9% consider themselves to be in the middle class and less than 1% considers themselves to be rich or very rich
This perhaps indicates the extent of mistargeting in the SLT program
This distribution of SLT beneficiaries by subjective poverty status is similar across areas
Finally, households were asked to compare their current (2006) economic condition with that of 2 years ago
Forty-two percent of households stated that they are now worse off than they were 2 years earlier, 31% stated that their socioeconomic condition is about the same, and 26% are now better off
This subjective assessment on change in welfare is consistent with the trend at the national level, where the official poverty rate has increased from 15.97% in 2005 to 17.75% in 2006
Looking across areas, it seems that urban areas performed worse than other areas
In USDRP areas, a much higher percentage of households (52%) stated that they are now worse off, while only 14% feel that they are now better off
Data Enumeration and Determination of Beneficiaries Table 7.1.3 provides the household assessments of the implementation of the 2005 household socioeconomic data enumeration (PSE05) that was conducted by BPS and its working partners
The data enumeration collected information on households that neighborhood (RT) heads considered to be poor
According to the GDS2 findings, only 55% of SLT beneficiary households were actually visited by PSE05 enumerators
The lowest proportion is found in SPADA areas (51%) and the highest in USDRP areas (70%)
This indicates that many enumerators may have filled in the household questionnaires by themselves without directly asking the respondents
Among those who were actually visited by the PSE05 enumerators, only approximately twothirds received an explanation as to why the data was being collected
This proportion is similar across areas
Furthermore, when a PSE05 enumerator visited a household, they did not always ask all of the questions on the questionnaire; only 66% of the visited households were asked all questions
Across areas, the lowest proportion of visited households which were asked all the questions was found in SPADA areas at 63%, while the highest is in USDRP areas at 73%
SLT beneficiary households were also asked whether they are aware of the eligibility criteria for SLT beneficiaries
The result indicates that only 36% of SLT beneficiaries are aware of the criteria
This proportion is similar across areas
Ninety-two percent of those who know what the eligibility criteria were thought they were appropriate and the proportion is equally high across all areas
In addition, 75% of them think that the target for SLT beneficiaries was accurate
However, only 66% of households who are aware of SLT eligibility criteria in USDRP areas think that the target was accurate, while in SPADA and ILGRP areas the proportion is as high as 78%
This perhaps indicates that anti-poverty programs in urban areas are more prone to mistargeting
Distribution of SLT Recipient Identification Card (KKB) to Beneficiaries After the SLT beneficiary selection process was completed, beneficiary households were provided with SLT recipient identification cards, commonly known as Kartu Kompensasi BBM (KKB)
The card was the main and often the only document required for the disbursement of SLT funds
According to the program guidelines, the KKB should have been distributed or delivered to SLT beneficiary houses
By doing it this way, it was expected that the BPS officer who distributed the KKB could verify whether the recipient was really eligible to receive the SLT benefit
The finding in Table 7.1.4, however, suggests that only 62% of the KKB were delivered to beneficiaries' homes
This proportion was highest in USDRP areas (66%) and lowest was in SPADA areas (53%)
Those who did not have their card delivered were required to pick it up from a designated place, mostly from the house of the neighborhood leader
Most SLT beneficiaries (more than 94%) were informed about the amount of SLT funds that they would receive, the place and time of disbursement, as well as the documents they would require in order to collect the SLT funds
However, only one-third of SLT beneficiaries were provided with information on the complaints process for the program, including where, how, and to whom they could report any complaints or suggestions related to the SLT program
This pattern was similar across most areas, but fell to one quarter in USDRP areas
Disbursement of SLT Funds Between the last quarter of 2005 and the third quarter of 2006, SLT funds were disbursed in four quarterly tranches
By the time the GDS2 survey was implemented in June 2006, the first three tranches of the SLT fund disbursements had been completed
Hence, questions on the SLT program's implementation are based on the first three tranches
Table 7.1.5 shows that, on average, funds were to be collected from locations 7.6 kilometers from beneficiaries' homes, and mostly from post offices
As expected, beneficiaries in USDRP had the shortest average distance between their homes and the funds collection point (4.1 kilometers), and those in the SPADA areas had the longest distance to travel (10.3 kilometers)
As the collection locations were generally not within walking distance, most beneficiaries needed to use some form of transportation in order to collect SLT funds
Consistent with the average distance of distribution points from a beneficiary's home, it took quite some time for beneficiaries to reach the distribution points
An average traveling time of 45 minutes
Beneficiaries in the urban USDRP areas had the shortest traveling time at 24 minutes, while the longest time was experienced in SPADA areas (64 minutes)
Beneficiaries incurred out of pocket expenses for transportation to the distribution points
On average, transportation cost Rp8,722, or less than 3% of the Rp300,000 collected every quarter
The lowest average transportation costs were incurred by beneficiaries in USDRP areas (Rp4,281) and the highest by beneficiaries in SPADA areas (Rp13,132)
The majority of beneficiaries spent more time queuing to receive their funds than they did traveling to the distribution point
The average waiting time was 82 minutes, with the lowest average time in ILGRP areas (71 minutes) and the highest in SPADA areas (87 minutes)
The table also suggests that SLT funds were not disbursed regularly and that there were delays in some areas
Only 70% of households that had received at least one tranche of SLT funds between October 2005 and June 2006 received the first tranche; this figure was similar across areas
The figure increased slightly to 71% for the second tranche, again similar across areas
This increase may be due to the increasing number of SLT beneficiaries due to the protests, but the magnitude of the increase was much smaller than the official data on beneficiary numbers suggests
Only 47% of beneficiaries had received the third tranche of funds at the time of the survey (June 2006)
As the third tranche was due to be disbursed in April 2006, this figure indicates a considerable delay in the disbursement of SLT funds in a large number of areas
Use of SLT Funds Table 7.1.6 indicates that beneficiary households used SLT fund for various purposes, but the primary use was for meeting household consumption needs
The table shows that 60% of beneficiaries used their SLT funds for buying rice, 50% used it for buying other food, and 36% used it for buying kerosene
Beneficiaries who used the last tranche of SLT funds they received for buying rice spent an average of Rp77,771 on rice, or 26% of the money they received
Other food accounted for a smaller amount of expenditure at Rp49,635 (16.5% of the money received), and kerosene only Rp11,763 (4% of the money received)
A significant number (one-third) of SLT beneficiary households used the funds for paying off debts, spending an average of Rp52,334, or more than 17% of the money received
Others used the funds to pay for educational- and health-related expenses
Sixteen percent of beneficiaries used the funds to pay for school fees, spending an average of Rp16,848 (less than 6% of the money received) and 21% used the money to pay for medicines, spending an average of Rp9,511 (3% of the money received)
Some beneficiaries used the money as additional business capital, but this only accounts for 8% of beneficiaries, and only Rp10,039 was allocated on average, or slightly more than 3% of the total SLT funds they received
A comparison of the figures in all areas indicates that these usage patterns were similar across areas
Problems and Complaints The SLT program encountered several problems during its implementation
Table 7.1.7 shows that according to its own beneficiaries, the data enumeration was the most problematic (17%), while distribution of the KKB was the least problematic (5%)
Around 10% of beneficiaries encountered problems with both the socialization and distribution of SLT funds
The pattern was similar across most areas, but the proportion of beneficiaries who encountered problems with the distribution of KKB in USDRP areas was almost double that of other areas
One-third of beneficiaries who encountered problems lodged complaints
USDRP areas had the highest proportion of beneficiaries who lodged complaints (44%) and SPADA areas had the lowest (31%)
Only 29% of those who did complain were satisfied with the response they received from the program implementer
The highest satisfaction rate was in ILGRP areas (31%) and the lowest satisfaction rate was in USDRP areas, at only 20%
The Implementation of the SLT Program according to Village Heads The survey also asked village heads about the implementation of the SLT program in their village
Table 7.1.8 shows that even though all villages were covered by the program, in some villages not a single household became program beneficiaries
Ninety-nine percent of villages had at least one SLT recipient among their population
Curiously, however, the few villages which had no SLT recipients are located in SPADA and ILGRP areas
In contrary, all sample villages in USDRP areas had SLT recipients among their population
According to the heads of villages with SLT recipients, village officials actively participated in the socialization of the program
Officials in 85% of villages participated in the socialization of the program itself and officials in 94% of villages socialized details about the place and time of the funds distribution and the documents required to receive the funds
Across areas, USDRP areas had the highest proportion of villages where village officials actively participated in the socialization of the SLT program and SPADA areas the lowest
Fewer village officials were involved in other aspects of the program's implementation
Only 62% of village heads were provided with information about the SLT program before the data enumeration was implemented
Furthermore, only one-half of village heads were involved in the selection of data enumerators
This situation was similar across areas
Only 53% of villages could fully implement the selection criteria used to determine SLT beneficiaries, and only 57% of village heads thought that the selection criteria were appropriate
The highest percentages for both questions are found in ILGRP areas and the lowest in USDRP areas
The initial data enumeration for the selection of SLT recipients was problematic and drew protests from people who considered themselves to be poor but who were not selected as recipients
Consequently, a second data enumeration was conducted a few weeks after the first tranche of SLT funds was disbursed
The re-enumeration was conducted in 91% of villages and as a result additional recipients were added to the list of beneficiaries in 70% of the villages
This trend is similar across areas
Finally, regarding the distribution of the KKB, most village heads stated that KKB cards were delivered to recipients' houses (65%)
Beneficiaries in 22% of the villages were required to collect their card from a specific location, generally the house of the local RT head, 11% were distributed in a community meeting, and 2% used other distribution methods
In USDRP areas 73% of the cards were delivered to beneficiary houses, however in SPADA areas only 50% of the cards were delivered this way
7.2 The School Operational Assistance (BOS) Program 
The School Operational Assistance (BOS) program is part of the PKPS-BBM for the education sector, which is designed as a general subsidy for all public and private primary and junior secondary schools, including primary schools (SD), Islamic primary schools (MI), special primary schools (SDLB), junior secondary schools (SMP) 
Islamic junior high schools (MTs), special junior high schools (SMPLB), and traditional Islamic schools (salafiyah)
as well as non-Islamic religious primary and junior high schools that are implementing the Wajardikdas (Compulsory Basic Education) Program
The amount of funds to be received by each school is calculated based on the number of students enrolled, with an allocation of Rp 235,000 per student per annum for primary schools and Rp 324,500 per student per annum for junior secondary schools
BOS is a central government program
The program is funded entirely from the national budget (APBN) and implemented through the deconcentration funding mechanism
Funds are distributed directly to the bank accounts of beneficiary schools from the provincial or district level
Socialization The official socialization of the BOS program was conducted by BOS teams at the central, regional, and local levels
There were variations in the quality and coverage of the socialization materials and participants across regions
Aside from the official or formal socialization, information about the BOS program was made widely available in national and local media such as television and newspapers
Table 7.2.1 provides an assessment by school principals on the socialization of the BOS program
The table shows that 93% of school principals thought that the information disseminated regarding the requirements, total amount of funds to be received, and mechanisms of the BOS program were adequate
This assessment is similarly high across areas, the lowest rate in SPADA areas (90%) and the highest in USDRP areas (96%)
However, a smaller proportion (80%) of school principals feel that the official socialization of the BOS program by their district education office was adequate
Across areas, the proportion was lowest in SPADA areas (72%) and highest in ILGRP areas (85%)
The fact that more school principals stated that they had received adequate information about the program than those who thought that their District Education Office's socialization was adequate indicates that a significant proportion of school principals received their information about the BOS program from sources other than the district education office
Implementation Table 7.2.2 provides a description about the implementation and results of the BOS program based on information provided by school principals
The table shows that almost all schools participated in the BOS program in the 2005/2006 academic year
Only 3 out of the 1,251 schools in the sample refused BOS funds
From the schools that have received BOS funds, 89% of principals stated that the school actually received the correct allocation of BOS funds in the 2005/2006 academic year
This proportion is similar across areas, except in USDRP areas where the proportion is significantly higher at 93%
Discrepancies between allocations and the amount of actual funds received are most likely due to changes in student numbers between the data collection period and the BOS funds disbursement
The central government disburses BOS funds twice each year
While the transfers should have taken place at the start of each semester
In reality disbursements are usually delayed until around the middle of semester
The funds from the central government are first transferred to the account of the BOS program in each province
In most provinces the funds are then distributed directly to school accounts, and in others the funds are transferred to a BOS program account in each district from where they are then distributed to school accounts
The frequency of funds distribution from provincial or district accounts to school accounts varies across regions
The table shows that the average frequency of funds disbursements during the 2005/2006 academic year was between 2 and 3 times in SPADA areas and between 3 and 4 times in both ILGRP and USDRP areas
One of the requirements that BOS beneficiary schools must fulfill is that they develop a school income and expenditure budget plan (RAPBS)
Schools must include the estimated amount of BOS funds that they will receive in the RAPBS as part of the school's income
The table suggests that the planned expenditure of the majority (46%) of schools in 2005/2006 was higher than the amount of BOS funds they received
The budgeted expenditure of 37% of schools was about the same as income from BOS funds, while in 17% of schools budgeted expenditure was less than income from BOS funds
This pattern is similar across areas; however, it is much sharper in USDRP areas where two-thirds of schools had planned expenditure in excess of the amount of BOS funds they were due to receive
According to the BOS program regulations, schools whose BOS income is equal to or greater than their planned expenditure in the RAPBS should not collect fees from students' parents
The transfer of BOS funds to school bank accounts did not coincide with the commencement of the 2005/2006 school year
Because of this, around 40% of schools in the sample collected school fees from the parents of students before they received the BOS funds
Once the BOS funds were received, 12% of these schools returned the entire amount of school fees to parents and 7% returned only part of the school fees that parents has paid
As many as 21% of these schools, however, have not returned the money they received to students' families since receiving the BOS funds
This pattern is similar across areas
It is interesting to note that USDRP areas had the highest proportion (56%) of schools that had collected fees before receiving BOS funds and notably the lowest proportion (only 7%) of schools that fully returned the fees after receiving BOS funds
BOS funds can only be used for certain types of school expenditure as determined by the technical implementation guidelines for the BOS program
BOS beneficiary schools are required to report the use of BOS funds to district-level BOS teams at the end of each semester
In reality, however, reporting requirements vary across districts and provinces
The table shows that only 31% of schools in the sample are required to submit one report once each semester as stipulated in the BOS regulations
The majority (49%) of schools are required to report once every 3 months, while 12% of schools are required to report every month and 8% of schools have other reporting requirements
This reporting requirement patterns differ significantly across areas
The proportion of schools which are required to report once each semester is highest in SPADA areas (42%) and lowest in USDRP areas (18%)
The proportion of schools which are required to report once every 3 months is highest in USDRP areas (67%) and lowest in SPADA areas (45%)
Whilst the proportion of schools which are required to report every month is highest in ILGRP areas (17%) and lowest in SPADA areas (7%)
As explained earlier, the BOS program is designed as a general subsidy
However, the program explicitly aims to help the poor access the nine-years of compulsory basic (primary and junior secondary) education
BOS beneficiary schools are therefore required to allocate a portion of the funds they receive to support poor students
In the 2005/2006 academic year, however, the BOS program guidelines limited the form of support for poor students to only cover transportation costs
Table 7.2.3 shows the use of BOS funds for supporting poor students based on the information provided by school principals
The criteria for assessing which students are poor are determined independently by each school
The table indicates that the incidence of poverty among primary and junior secondary school students is quite high, at 46% of the total number of students on average
Across areas, the highest proportion of poor students is found in SPADA areas (57%) and the lowest in USDRP areas (28%)
Notwithstanding the high incidence of poverty among students, in the 2005/2006 academic year, only 33% of schools used BOS funds to support the transportation costs of poor students
Across areas and going against the trend of incidence of poverty among students, the highest proportion of schools which provided transportation costs support for poor students is found in ILGRP and USDRP areas with 36%, while the lowest is found in SPADA areas (28%)
In the schools which provided transportation costs support for poor students in 2005/2006, 79% of the total number of poor students or around 28% of total students received the support
Across areas, the highest proportion of poor students who received support is found in SPADA areas with 86% of the total number poor students or 39% of total students, while the lowest was in USDRP areas with 61% of total poor students or 17% of total students
Table 7.2.4 provides an assessment of several aspects of the BOS program's implementation according to officials at district education offices
Program socialization is deemed to be well implemented by most district education offices
With more than 90% of the district education offices reporting that the socialization of the BOS program in their districts is adequate
The proportion notably reached 100% in ILGRP and USDRP areas
However, 64% of the district education offices admitted that there are problems in the implementation of the BOS program in their district
The proportion is highest in USDRP areas (100%) and lowest in ILGRP areas, at only 54%
The BOS program guidelines require the district education office to establish a complaints handling system for people to lodge complaints about any aspect of BOS's implementation
The table shows that only 69% of districts have established such a mechanism
However, all districts in USDRP areas have established a complaints mechanism while only half (51%) of those in SPADA areas have done so
While the school-level data suggests that only a small minority of schools have refused to participate in the BOS program, information from district education offices indicates that they exist in all areas, but mostly in urbanized regions
Overall, 19% of districts have at least one school which refused to participate in the BOS program
In the USDRP areas this proportion reaches as high as 60%, while in SPADA areas it is very low at only 6%
Impact School principals were asked to assess various aspects of the impact of the BOS program
Table 7.2.5 indicates that 88% of school principals consider that the BOS program has improved the quality of teaching in their schools
Moreover, 96% stated that the BOS program has improved the availability of books and teaching equipment in their school and 84% stated that the program has improved the quality of their schools' infrastructure
These patterns are similar across areas; however the figures for impact on teaching quality and school infrastructure are slightly lower in the USDRP areas compared to other areas
Almost 80% of school principals stated that the BOS program has improved the access of poor students to their schools
This proportion is similar across areas, with the highest rate in USDRP areas (84%) and the lowest in SPADA areas (78%)
However, only 61% of school principals could confirm that enrollment of poor students in their schools has actually increased since the BOS program was implemented
Contrary to their assessment on access of the poor to schooling, USDRP areas actually have the lowest rate of schools that have experienced an increase in the enrollment of poor students (53%), while the highest proportion is found in SPADA areas (65%)
7.3 The Health Insurance for Poor Families (Askeskin) Program The PKPS-BBM health sector program is expected to help the poor by providing access to basic health services
Since 2005, the PKPS-BBM health sector program has been known as the Health Insurance for Poor Families (Askeskin) program due to the change of the institution in charge of implementing the program, now PT Askes, a state-owned health insurance company
The program provides benefits to the poor by giving them access to public health service providers, such as puskesmas and public hospitals
A poor family that is entitled to obtain free access to public health service providers is issued with a health card by PT Askes
However, not all of the poor are beneficiaries of the Askeskin or other related programs
Hence, those who are not program beneficiaries may still obtain similar benefits by using a recommendation letter for the poor (SKTM)
Such a letter is usually issued by the village head based on information or recommendation from local community/neighborhood heads (ketua RT/RW)
Participation and Utilization Table 7.3.1 provides details regarding possession of the Askeskin card and its use based on information from households in the sample
The table also describes the utilization of SKTM to obtain access to health services
The table shows that Askeskin cards were distributed to 28% of household respondents
This is significantly higher than the official poverty rate, which stood at approximately 18% in 2006
This indicates that not only poor households have become Askeskin program beneficiaries
Across areas, the highest proportion of Askeskin beneficiary households is found in SPADA areas (38%) and the lowest is found in USDRP areas (21%)
Most beneficiaries (60%) have used their Askeskin card to obtain free services at puskesmas, while the proportion of beneficiaries who have used their Askeskin card to obtain free services at public hospitals is much lower (27%)
The usage patterns are similar across areas, with the highest usage rates for both services found in USDRP areas and the lowest in ILGRP areas
Furthermore, the table shows that 6% of households in the sample have used a SKTM to obtain free health services
Across areas, the highest proportion of SKTM users is found in USDRP areas at 9%, while the lowest is found in SPADA areas at 5%
The existence of people using SKTM to obtain free health services indicates that although the coverage of Askeskin program beneficiaries is much higher than the official poverty rates, there is still a significant proportion of households who are in need but are being missed by the Askeskin program
Selection of Beneficiaries Table 7.3.2 provides information on the implementation of the Askeskin program based on information from village heads
Some 82% of village heads reported to have at least one Askeskin program beneficiary household in their village
Across areas, the highest proportion of villages with Askeskin program beneficiaries is found in USDRP areas (97%), whilst the lowest is found in SPADA areas (76%)
This is unfortunate as it shows that in reality the program tends to be urban biased, skipping over a significant proportion of the needy in disadvantaged in rural areas
Ninety-two percent of villages with Askeskin program beneficiaries selected the beneficiaries through data enumeration
In fact, in USDRP and ILGRP areas, 100% and 97% of the villages respectively conducted data enumeration, while the figure fell to 89% in SPADA areas
Just over one quarter (26%) of these villages reported to have faced some difficulties with the enumeration
The proportion of villages that experienced difficulties in the data enumeration is highest in USDRP areas at 31% and lowest in ILGRP areas at 19%
The distribution of health cards to selected beneficiary households was also identified as being problematic
Only 64% of village heads reported to have distributed health cards to all program beneficiaries
The highest proportion of villages which have distributed health cards to all beneficiaries is found in USDRP areas (90%) and the lowest in SPADA areas at just 54%
Implementation Problems Table 7.3.3 provides puskesmas head assessments on the implementation of the Askeskin program
Only 52% of puskesmas head respondents thought that the criteria used to select Askeskin program recipients were appropriate
This relatively low approval rate is similar across areas, with the highest found in ILGRP areas (56%) and both USDRP and SPADA areas recording an approval rate of 52%
Furthermore, 18% of puskesmas heads identified that there had been complaints related to the use of Askeskin in their puskesmas
Across areas, the highest proportion is found in USDRP areas with 21% and the lowest is in the ILGRP areas with 14%
When a patient needs further treatment that cannot be performed at puskesmas they are referred to a public hospital
Ten percent of puskesmas heads advised that an Askeskin recipient patient they had referred had been refused by the public hospital
Across areas, a notably high proportion of puskesmas heads reported that public hospitals had refused Askeskin patients they had referred in USDRP areas ( 21%) and the lowest proportion is found in SPADA areas (7%)
According to puskesmas heads, the number of complaints related to the use of Askeskin in public hospitals (34%) is nearly double that of those related to its use in puskesmas
USDRP areas also have the highest proportion (41%) of puskesmas heads who identified complaints concerning public hospital use of Askeskin while SPADA areas have the lowest (33%)
Socialization and Complaint Channels The District Health Office is responsible for the implementation of the Askeskin program at the district level
This responsibility includes the socialization of the program to stakeholders in the district
Table 7.3.4 provides district health officer assessments of the implementation of the Askeskin program
The table shows that 87% of interviewed district health officers thought that the socialization of the Askeskin program in their districts was adequate
In the USDRP areas, all of the interviewed district health officers claimed that the program's socialization was adequate, while in the SPADA and ILGRP areas the proportion reaches 82% and 85% respectively
Nevertheless, a large proportion (72%) of district health officers also admitted to having experienced problems related to the implementation of the Askeskin program in their areas
Across areas, the highest proportion is found in ILGRP areas (85%) and the lowest in USDRP areas (60%)
As a way to deal with these problems, district health offices are required to establish a complaints mechanism that people can access to lodge complaints regarding the implementation of the Askeskin program
However, the table shows that only 69% of district health offices have actually established such a channel
Across areas, all district health offices in USDRP areas claimed to have established such a channel, while the lowest figure was reported in SPADA areas, where only half of the district health offices had done so
Agreements between PT Askes and Public Hospitals Askeskin card holders should have access to public hospitals under the program
Each district or city usually has a public hospital
The use of Askeskin in public hospitals is based on agreements between PT Askes and individual public hospitals
The GDS2 surveyed public hospitals in the sample districts
Table 7.3.5 shows that 96% of public hospitals mentioned that their hospital has an agreement with PT Askes concerning the implementation of the Askeskin program
All public hospitals surveyed in ILGRP and USDRP areas have an existing agreement with PT Askes, while only 90% of public hospitals in SPADA areas have such an agreement
The table shows that more than 80% of the agreements between PT Askes and public hospitals cover the type and tariff of services, the procedures for verifying a patient's identity, procedure for verifying provided services, claim and payment processes, and complaint handling and resolution procedures
However, less than 40% of the agreements cover the number of patients that can be served in the hospitals
Across areas, the table indicates that the agreements between PT Askes and public hospitals in USDRP areas seem to be the most comprehensive, while those in SPADA areas seem to be the least comprehensive
However, less than 50% of the agreements in USDRP areas cover complaint handling and resolution procedures
Claim Handling Table 7.3.6 provides summary information about Askeskin claims handling at public hospitals
The table shows that 92% of public hospitals have specifically assigned a staff member to monitor and verify Askeskin claims
In fact, all public hospitals in ILGRP and USDRP areas have assigned this role, while only 84% of hospitals in SPADA areas have done so
Ninety-four percent of public hospitals surveyed report Askeskin claims to PT Askes on a monthly basis
Consisting of all public hospitals in ILGRP and USDRP areas and only 90% of those in SPADA areas
On average, the hospital receives payment from PT Askes 26 days after submitting a claim
Across areas, USDRP areas have the shortest payment period from PT Askes with 18 days on average, while SPADA areas experience the longest wait with an average of 32 days
Delays in Askeskin claim payments from PT Askes to public hospitals seem to be a common occurrence
The table shows that 72% of public hospitals have experienced delays in claim payments 
SPADA areas experience the longest delays at 50 days on average
USDRP areas experience the shortest delays with an average of 22 days
In addition to delays, public hospitals commonly experience claim denials from PT Askes
Fifty-nine percent of public hospitals have experienced a claim denial
In USDRP areas all of the sample public hospitals have had claims denied, in ILGRP areas the figure is 92%, and in SPADA areas 61% of the sample public hospitals have had claims denied
Public Hospital Income from Askeskin Table 7.3.7 shows the proportion of total public hospital income originating from Askeskin claims and the use of Askeskin income in 2005
The table shows that on average, income from Askeskin accounted for 36% of total public hospital income
Across areas, the importance of Askeskin to public hospital income was highest in SPADA areas (46%) and lowest in USDRP areas (24%)
In 2005, the highest proportion of public hospital income from Askeskin was used to pay for doctors, making up 26% of public hospital claims income
The next two largest expenses were medical supplies and pharmaceuticals, which each absorbed 17%
Expenses for administration, beds and equipment, and meals each accounted for 7–8% of the allocation
These patterns are similar across areas
However, in USDRP areas, expenses for medical supplies were quite low at only 5% of the allocation
Conversely, in ILGRP areas, expenses for medical supplies were quite high at 28%
Askeskin Patients in Public Hospitals Table 7.3.8 shows the trend in the share of patients under the Askeskin program and the previous health card program occupying third class rooms in public hospitals from 2003 to 2005
The table clearly shows that there has been a significant increase in the share of Askeskin/health card holders occupying third class rooms in public hospitals, from 52% in 2003 to 57% in 2004 and to 67% in 2005
The increase was mostly driven by increases in ILGRP and SPADA areas
In ILGRP areas, the share increased from 39% in 2003, to 48% in 2004 and 64% in 2005
In SPADA areas, the share increased from 49% in 2003, to 53% in 2004 and to 62% in 2005
In USDRP areas, the share was already high at around 61% in 2003 and remained constant in 2004, but increased significantly to 69% in 2005
7.4 The Village Infrastructure (IP) Program 
The Village Infrastructure (IP) program is another PKPS-BBM program, 
provides block grants directly to recipient villages
The village head usually leads the management of the IP program at the village level in coordination with the Village Representative Body (badan permusyawaratan desa or BPD in rural areas and dewan kelurahan or DK in urban areas)
Project Implementation Table 7.4.1 shows that only 31% of the 838 villages in the sample have received IP program grants
Across areas, the highest proportion of villages that have received IP program block grants is found in USDRP areas, which are urban areas
The lowest proportion of villages that have received grants is found in ILGRP areas
In SPADA areas, which are disadvantaged rural areas, only 37% of the villages have received IP grants
Seventy-six percent of villages that have received IP program grants used the funds for road construction and repairs
This confirms that roads are the most needed form of infrastructure to improve villagers' ability to move around within their own village and, more importantly, improve their access to areas outside their village
The second most common use of IP grants is bridge construction or repair, which is complementary to roads, with 24% of villages using the grants for this purpose
The next two most common uses of the grants are the building or repairing of sources of drinking water supplies and irrigation systems, at 14% and 7% respectively
The grants are also used for many other projects in accordance with the specific needs of recipient villages
The usage pattern for IP program block grants is similar across areas with some exceptions
In ILGRP areas, 90% of villages use the grants for building or repairing roads, but only 5% of villages have decided to use the grants for building or repairing bridges, drinking water supplies, and irrigation
In USDRP areas, on the other hand, 41% of villages have used the grants for building or repairing bridges and 18% of the villages have repaired irrigation systems
The average budget allocated to each project in all areas is slightly over Rp200 million
Participation and Benefit Aside from providing funds for infrastructure improvements in beneficiary villages, the IP program was designed to empower local people by letting them decide how to use the grant
However, Table 7.4.2 shows that only 23% of households are aware that their village received the IP grants, with the highest proportion found in SPADA areas (33%) and the lowest in ILGRP areas (20%)
Among the households who are aware that their village has received an IP program block grant, 75% received the information from their village heads, with similar rates across areas
Furthermore, 33% have at least one household member who participated in the program in their village
SPADA areas have the highest participation rate (42%) and USDRP areas have the lowest (22%)
The main benefit of the IP program for most of these households was the resulting village infrastructure improvement (75%), not employment opportunities (18%) or increased household income (24%)
In addition, 10% of households stated that they received other benefits from the program
These patterns are similar across areas; however, in SPADA areas significantly more households stated that they benefited from employment opportunities (25% of households) and increased income (35% of households) due to the IP program
VIII
CONCLUSION GDS2 
Sampling and Analysis Method The Governance and Decentralization Survey 2 (GDS2), as a continuation of the GDS1 and GDS1+, aimed to evaluate the performance of local service providers, the satisfaction of service consumers, and the conditions of local governance, with a view toward informing particular policy questions in the context of decentralization
The GDS2 also incorporates an assessment of government programs related to the reduction of the fuel subsidy, known as PKPS-BBM, in particular the Unconditional Cash Transfer (SLT), Health Insurance for Poor Families (Askeskin), and the Village Infrastructure (IP) components
The survey's sampling sites included the sites of three World Bank (WB) projects (SPADA, ILGRP, and USDRP districts), enabling the GDS2 analysis to be disaggregated by the three projects
The GDS2 is an integrated survey of households, public health and education facilities, private health practitioners, hamlet heads, and district- and village-level officials
Approximately 32,000 respondents were interviewed
The survey instruments were designed to assemble detailed information on the provision and use of local public services, as well as the governance environment in which those services are delivered
The survey was undertaken during the months of April to July 2006
The total number of districts included in the sample was 140, consisting of 134 original sample districts plus 6 ANPEA (Aceh and Nias Public Expenditure Analysis) districts
The survey in the ANPEA districts excluded the household, school teacher, school committee, private health provider, and general hospital instruments
Access to Public Services Village head assessments on public services vary depending on the type of service in question
With figures ranging from 24% of village heads who stated that irrigation systems are adequate to 65% who feel that legal procedures are adequate
If divided according to World Bank project areas, USDRP areas generally have the highest proportion of village heads who feel the public services in their areas are adequate (with the exception of irrigation systems), while SPADA areas have the lowest proportion
This is not surprising considering that USDRP areas are urban, while SPADA areas are disadvantaged and marginal
Access to Education Services Access to education services is measured using several variables related to students' transportation to schools, such as the type of transportation used, travel time, and daily transportation cost, disaggregated by the level of schooling
The results show that most students walk to school, but the proportion of students who walk to school declines the higher the level of education
Travel times and transportation costs are gradually higher for higher levels of education
If disaggregated by World Bank project areas, students in SPADA areas have the longest travel time to schools, while those in USDRP areas have the shortest
Travel costs are highest in USDRP areas and lowest in SPADA areas
Access to Health Services The assessment of access to health services is also based on transportation matters, which include the mode of transportation and travel time to the health service providers
However, prior to the assessment, filtering information such as whether the respondent knows about the existence of the nearest health providers is also assessed
The findings indicate that people's awareness of the nearest puskesmas is much better than for public hospitals
This may be because most puskesmas are located at the subdistrict level and are thus usually closer to people's homes than public hospitals, which are generally only found at the district level
Furthermore, the finding also suggests that puskesmas are generally the most accessible health provider
Village Administration Services Access to village administration services is measured using variables related to the ease of obtaining an identity card (KTP)
The results show that 61% of households have a member who has obtained a KTP during the past 2 years and around 74% of those claim to know the official procedure for obtaining a KTP
It takes almost 8 days on average to obtain a KTP in USDRP areas, and much longer in the SPADA areas, at about 18 days
However, the cost of obtaining a KTP does not differ significantly across regions, averaging at around Rp 19,000
The use of informal intermediaries is prevalent in efforts to obtain a KTP, with around 47% of households using them
Access to Information Access to information is measured using several variables, with an emphasis placed on access to information at the village level such as village budgets and development programs, and awareness of the village representative body
The findings show that only 15% of households have access to information on their village's budget allocation and only 25% to information on village development programs
Similar proportions across the different World Bank project areas
Awareness of the existence of the village representative body is better, with 48% of households aware of its existence, with the exception of USDRP districts where the proportion is only 26%
Police Services Respondents were asked about their experiences accessing police services during the 2 years prior to the survey
Around 80% of households that have accessed police services in that time frame did so in order to obtain a driving license
In total, at least one household member in 15% of households has obtained a driving license during the last 2 years, with similar rates across areas
Around 80% of households claim to know the official procedure for obtaining a driving license
While this figure is equally high across areas, the average length of time taken to obtain a driving license varies widely across areas
In USDRP (urban) areas it only takes an average of 2 days, while in SPADA areas it takes more than 6 days
However, the cost of obtaining a driving license is higher in USDRP areas
The shorter turnaround time and higher cost in USDRP areas probably reflects the high use of informal intermediaries—the highest of all the areas
In general, 36% of households use intermediaries and 80% of the intermediaries are police officers
Conflict and Securities Both households and village heads were asked about disputes and conflicts that have occurred in their area during the 2 years prior to the survey
Interestingly, households report a much lower number of disputes and conflicts than village heads report
However, households are also far less satisfied with dispute and conflict resolutions than are village heads
According to households, the most frequently occurring type of disputes and conflicts are related to crime, but village heads stated that land and building issues account for the largest number of disputes and conflicts
However, on the whole, around 3 to 4 times more village heads than households acknowledged that disputes and conflicts have occurred
Furthermore, most respondents feel satisfied with the resolutions of the disputes and conflicts that occurred, except for households in the case of disputes and conflicts stemming from abuses of power
Participation and Social Capital Approximately half of the households surveyed stated that their level of participation in village activities is currently the same as it was 2 years ago, while around one-third feel that their participation has increased, and 10% say that their level of participation has fallen
These proportions are similar across all areas
The descriptive analysis of social trust shows some expected patterns
The results show that people have the highest level of trust for people within their own neighborhood (RT)
At this smallest unit of community, more than 90% of households trust either everyone or at least most of the people
Around 70% of households trust everyone or most of the people within the wider level of village, with the figure falling to around 60% for trust in people of a different religion or ethnicity
However, there is significant variation across areas
The highest level of social trust is consistently found in SPADA areas
Politics Political aspects were assessed using several variables, from common issues such as knowledge about political leaders at the national, district, and village levels to issues related to the most recent election for district leader
The results show that knowledge of the name of the speaker of national parliament is very low, with only 11% of households aware of the speaker's name
The lowest rate was found in SPADA areas (8%) and the highest in USDRP areas (26%)
Similarly, only 13% of households know the name of the speaker of their local parliament; however the greatest number was found in SPADA areas (17%) and the lowest in USDRP areas (8%)
The executives fare better
In all areas, around 40% of households know their governor's name
Participation in local elections is quite high
Ninety-four percent of households voted in the recent election for district leader, except in USDRP areas where only 87% of household respondents voted
However, only 44% of those who voted knew about the background of the candidates
In all areas, most of those who voted put emphasis on the candidates' programs and experiences when considering who to vote for, whereas ethnicity and religion do not have a prominent role in the decision-making process with the exception of ILGRP areas
The majority of respondents who did not vote were prevented from doing so due to administrative or logistical problems
Only 21% of the nonvoters were genuinely not interested in voting
Transparency and Information Transparency is low in education institutions, particularly transparency of school costs and financing
Only 33% of parents have received detailed information regarding school costs and fees that they are required to pay and only 71% of parents know whether or not their school receives BOS funding
The proportions do not differ significantly across regions, with the highest proportion found in ILGRP areas (75%) and the lowest in USDRP areas (69%)
Among those parents who are aware that their children's school receives BOS funds, only 64% said that the funds have led to a reduction or the abolishment of school fees
District health offices evaluate themselves as being highly transparent and consider that they provide sufficient information to the public
The findings show that for every aspect evaluated, the proportion of district health offices which consider themselves to be transparent is always higher than 81%
In fact, all district health offices in USDRP areas consider themselves to be transparent and feel that they have provided adequate information to the public
Conversely, SPADA areas have the lowest proportion of district health offices that consider themselves to be transparent
Corruption An important indicator for governance aside from transparency is the extent of corruption
The survey asked household respondents if they were aware of cases of corruption and bribery having occurred in several institutions in the 2 years prior to the survey, specifically in those providing public services such as education, health, village administration, and the police
The results show that the most well known corruption is bribery involving police, with 19% of households claiming that they were aware of such activity
Corruption involving village officials was the second most prevalent, mentioned by 9% of households
Educations institutions are not free from illegal transactions either
Around 9% of households are aware of cases of corruption and bribery combined that had taken place at education institutions
Comparing World Bank project areas, the findings indicate more people acknowledged their awareness of corruption and bribery cases in USDRP areas than other areas, with the lowest proportion found in SPADA areas
Provision of Services Households generally gave quite positive assessments of education services
Around 71% of households think that overall education services are currently better than 2 years ago
More than 60% of households assessed several aspects such as the condition of school buildings and facilities, teachers' attention toward their students, and schooling costs as being better now than they were 2 years ago
Student learning achievements and extracurricular activities were assessed as being better now than 2 years ago by 58% and 47% of households respectively
These relatively positive assessments were quite consistent across all areas
Also in line with the above findings, around 80% of households are either satisfied or fairly satisfied with current education services
Nevertheless, household respondents consistently identified four major aspects in education services requiring improvement
student learning achievements (29%), condition of school buildings and facilities (27%), teachers' attention towards their students (17%), and affordability of the costs of education services (8%)
Like education, the overall household assessment of health services is positive, with similar patterns across areas
Seventy-one percent of household respondents think that overall health services are currently better than they were 2 years ago
Specific aspects such as the physical condition of the health service provider premises and the availability of stocks of medicines and vaccines were also assessed as being better than 2 years prior by 74% and 66% of respondents respectively
Fifty-five percent of respondents also stated that medical services are now more affordable than 2 years prior to the survey
Also consistent with the comparative assessment, across areas, around 90% of household respondents are either satisfied or fairly satisfied with current health services
Nevertheless, respondents consistently identified five major aspects in health services that need to be improved
the availability of medicines and vaccines stock (24%), affordability of the prices of medical services (20%), physical condition of health service provider (19%), attention and caring attitude of medical personnel (15%), and waiting time at health service providers (7%)
Condition of Facilities In general, facilities at junior secondary schools are relatively better than those at primary schools
Comparing areas, there is a general tendency for schools in USDRP areas to have the highest proportion of facilities in good condition, while schools in SPADA areas have the lowest proportions of facilities in good condition
The discrepancies are large for facilities such as computer laboratories, libraries, school health units, counseling rooms, toilets both for students and teachers, sports courts, classroom walls and roofs, and lighting
The proportions of facilities in good conditions at both puskesmas and private health service providers are generally relatively high
However, only 60% of puskesmas have toilets in good condition, while 78% of private health service providers have toilets in good condition
However, only 65% of private health service providers have medicine stock rooms in good condition
The conditions do not differ significantly across areas
However, only very few puskesmas in USDRP areas have electricity generators
This may indicate that the electricity supply in urban areas is rarely problematic
Minimum Standards of Service (MSS) Only district health offices were asked about minimum standards of service (MSS), not district education offices
The findings show that only 53% of districts in the sample can meet the minimum service standards set by the central government
The highest proportion is found in ILGRP areas (62%) and the lowest in USDRP areas (40%)
However, 40% of districts in USDRP areas have already issued local regulations related to the MSS, while less than 10% of districts in other areas have done so
At the puskesmas level, very few health centers have adequate resources to meet the MSS
In fact, none of the puskesmas in USDRP areas have adequate resources to meet the MSS
But 20% of USDRP districts have regulated sanctions for puskesmas that fail to meet the MSS, while only 6% of SPADA districts areas and no ILGRP districts have done so
Involvement of Health and Education Institution Heads in Decision-making Processes The percentage of both primary and junior secondary school principals who are involved in the determination of their school's vision and mission is quite high, accounting for 94% and 97% of principals respectively
However, far fewer principals are involved in other types of decision-making processes such as choosing the curriculum and selecting reference books
Furthermore, a far smaller proportion of primary school principals are involved in the determination of school curriculum than junior secondary principals
However, more primary school principals are involved in the selection of reference books, except in SPADA districts
The proportion of puskesmas heads involved in the determination of service charges is much lower than that stated by the district health offices
Based on information from puskesmas heads, the proportions range from 24% for SPADA districts to 45% for USDRP districts
According to the district health offices the proportions range from 71% in SPADA districts to 100% for USDRP districts
The Role of Health and Education Institution Heads as the Final Decision-maker Far fewer school principals are authorized to make final decisions than those who are involved in the decision-making process in general
There is not a significant difference between the proportions of primary and junior secondary school principals who make the final decision on the determination of admission criteria for new students
primary school principals acting as the final decision-maker in this matter than junior secondary school principals
Very few district education offices (none in the SPADA districts) stated that school principals have the authority to make the final decision regarding matters such as the recruitment of temporary teachers and the determination of participants for teacher capacity building
The indicator with the highest proportion of district education offices who stated that school principals are authorized to make the final decision is the determination of teacher evaluation criteria, at 17%
As is the case with school principals, according to district health offices, very few districts authorize puskesmas heads to make the final decision regarding matters such as the recruitment of doctors and temporary doctors
In fact, apart from those in SPADA districts, none of the district health offices stated that puskesmas heads have such authority
PKPS-BBM
SLT, BOS, Askeskin, and IP Programs The PKPS-BBM programs have national coverage and are all managed by the central government
However, according to the information from the bureaucrats in the survey, some districts have not actually been covered by the health sector, education sector, or village infrastructure PKPS-BBM programs
Further verification is needed as to whether the programs were really not implemented in those areas or if there were some problems with the survey data collection or input
Although there are some problems remaining with the implementation of the four PKPSBBM programs, particularly related to socialization and targeting, many stakeholders considered that the programs have generally resulted in positive impacts
The reported use of SLT funds is an example, where it is clear that the funds were particularly helpful for beneficiary households, especially in helping them to fulfill their consumption needs such as paying for food, kerosene, school fees, medicines, and repaying debts
According to school principals, the BOS program has had a significant positive impact on several aspects of schooling, particularly in terms of teaching quality, availability of books and teaching equipment, school infrastructure, and access to school for poor students
Similarly, the Askeskin program has also contributed to the increase in the proportion of poor people who can access health care services, while the village infrastructure program benefits most villagers by providing better village infrastructure
INTRODUCTION 1
Background 
To date, the system of centralized government has been viewed as an obstacle to regional development and has consequently encouraged the regions to struggle for real autonomy
One clear way that local governments (pemerintah daerah, pemda) can achieve this autonomy is through the management of local revenues (Pendapatan Asli Daerah, PAD)
As a result, by 1996, the local government had issued nearly 200 local regulations (peraturan daerah, perda) on the taxes, levies and other fees (CPIS, 1996)
In addition, local governments also released various policies concerning business activities, especially policies regulating markets and trade
These policies included the allocation of zones to control tea trade in West Java, a citrus fruit trading monopoly in West Kalimantan, the marketing of local produce through Village Co-operatives (KUD) in East Nusa Tenggara, and a prohibition on the marketing or transportation of raw cashew nuts from South Sulawesi
Similar policies were also put in place by the central government including the establishment of a cloves monopoly by the Cloves Marketing Board (BPPC) and inter-island livestock trade quotas
The stated aim of these policies was the protection of small farmers and producers
In practice, however, many of these local regulations and policies were intended to raise local revenue and protect the interests of certain groups
This consequently created a 'high cost economy' that distorted the business climate, weakened competitiveness, and impeded regional economic development
Furthermore, these policies then attracted extensive criticism from both national and international quarters
As a result, the central government attempted to rectify this situation by issuing the tax reform Law No
18, 1997, which limited the kinds of taxes and levies which may be collected in the regions
As a result of the monetary crisis that occurred in mid 1997, the Government of Indonesia signed a Letter of Intent (LoI) with the IMF on the 15 January, 1998
This promoted a program of deregulation through the correction of all central and regional government policies that had previously distorted the economy, including the abolition of inter-regional trade restrictions
The economic crisis that followed the monetary crisis, forced the central and regional governments to make every effort to implement both of the above measures
Various levies were abolished and those policies that had a negative impact on the market were abandoned
Both of these changes to government policy had a positive effect on the business climate, as well as improving farmers' incomes (SMERU, December 1999)
On the other hand, local governments subsequently viewed these policy changes as reducing their available sources of income
Consequently, many local governments have demanded that Law No 18, 1997 be amended by the central government
These demands have been further strengthened by the existence of new policies on decentralization and regional autonomy as outlined in Law No 22, 1999 on Regional Government and Law No 25, 1999 on the Fiscal Balance between the Central Government and the Regions
This new law provides wider opportunities for the regions to issue local regulations concerning taxes and levies, while (in theory) still setting certain limits through the application of various strict conditions
The policy of decentralization and regional autonomy is intended to bring the government closer to the people so that government services can be delivered more effectively and efficiently
Consequently, local governments must prove that they are capable of carrying out these polices in such a manner that brings significant benefits to the community
To achieve this, decentralization policies and regional autonomy should not only be in the form of delegated authority from the centre to the regions
The local governments must also eventually hand over some of their newly gained authority to the local community
The principle that is supposed to underlie decentralization policies and regional autonomy is the development of a participative and democratic community
However, in practice, this can only be achieved by governments that are open, responsible and fair
In other words, it is impossible for these policies to be implemented by local governments adhering to centralized and authoritarian practices
As far as economic activities are concerned, local governments need to make every effort to promote their region to attract investment and stimulate trade
However, there is no guarantee that local governments will make such an effort, since during the New Order period of centralized government, local government officials tended to follow central government directives with little opportunity to exercise their own authority
These practices have trapped local government officials in a system of routine, practical and pragmatic activities
Consequently, now that the regions have achieved a higher level of authority, there is concern that they will simply imitate the models and practices established by the central government
Many observers are concerned that local governments will become absorbed by the effort to increase local revenue through various taxes and levies, eventually resulting in a high cost economy
There is also concern about the possibility of local governments releasing policies that discriminate against individuals from outside the region for the sake of the local community and its inhabitants
This situation is a cause of real concern because it threatens national unity both politically and economically 
For example the policy of free trade between regions and Indonesia's existence as a single unified market entity
As part of our research into the initial phase of the implementation of decentralization and regional autonomy under Law No 22, 1999 and Law No 25, 1999, the SMERU team has carried out several field studies to specifically obtain information on the following issues
1
Local government policy concerning the implementation of wider local authority
Those policies related to local taxes, levies and other charges (both formal and informal)
Other policies relevant to the business climate, such as licensing and the regulation of local trade and markets
Furthermore, the extent to which the process of formulating formal regulations takes into account the views and interests of various community groups
2
The views of local government on the size of the General Allocation of Funds (Dana Alokasi Umum, DAU) and their strategies to increase local income through available sources of local revenue (PAD) such as local taxes and levies, along with the policies and practicalities relating to the allocation of funds

The views and opinions of various economic actors and other interest groups within society on the impact of local government policy on the business climate together with its implications for trade and investment, especially on the movement of goods and services
This report is based on the results of SMERU fieldwork in the Province of North Sulawesi and the Province of Gorontalo carried out between the 8 - 27 May, 2001
The SMERU team visited two kabupaten in North Sulawesi, Minahasa and Bolaang Mongondow (Bolmong)
The Province of Gorontalo, which has only recently become a province, was also included because Kabupaten Gorontalo had previously been chosen as part of the sample within the Province of North Sulawesi
The Province of North Sulawesi is one of nine provinces investigated by SMERU within the overall framework of this study
A primary consideration for selecting the nine provinces was their geographic representation, with areas from Eastern Indonesia, Java and Western Indonesia
Information was obtained from officials within the governor's office and the office of the Bupati, including the Governor, the Bupati and their staff, the regional secretaries and their staff, the heads of various bureaus and sections within the regional secretariat (legal affairs, organization, government administration, finance and economic affairs), and the regional planning and development board (Bappeda)
In addition, the team also interviewed the leaders of various government offices at the province and kabupaten level, including the industry and trade office (Dinas Perindustrian dan Perdagangan), the plantations office (Dinas Perkebunan), the animal husbandry office (Dinas Peternakan), the fisheries office (Dinas Perikanan), the forestry affairs office (Dinas Kehutanan), the transportation and communications office (Dinas Perhubungan) and the local treasury (Dinas Pendapatan Daerah)
For additional information, the team also consulted the head of the local people's representative assembly (DPRD) and the Statistics Indonesia office (Kantor BPS)
Also interviewed were officials of the local chamber of commerce and industry (Kadinda), the North Sulawesi coconut farmers' association (Apeksu), the Indonesian furniture makers' association (Asmindo), businessmen and entrepreneurs from various sectors, traders at various levels, transport drivers, farmers and fishermen, editors and journalists of local newspapers, NGO leaders, and the teaching staff of local institutes of higher education

Regional overview 
North Sulawesi is strategically located with the Republic of the Philippines and the Pacific Ocean to the North, providing the area with a unique advantage when compared with other provinces in Indonesia
Within the context of Asia Pacific trade, this location provides North Sulawesi with potential economic opportunities
Significant channels to access world trade centers such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the west coast of America
To date, however, these opportunities have not been seriously explored
Moreover, the opportunity to participate in the sub-regional economic cooperation zone, the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East Asian Growth Area (BIMP EAGA), has also been ignored, 
Despite the role played by the Governor of North Sulawesi and the Mayor of Davao City in making the establishment of this organization possible (see Kompas, 12 July 1999)
During the era of regional autonomy, the local government of North Sulawesi has become aware that the above opportunities have significant potential for the region that must quickly be exploited
Improvements in communications and transport have already taken place, especially at the Sam Ratulangi Airport
In addition, the development of facilities at the Port of Bitung to transform it into an international seaport has become a development priority of the province
It is hoped that the development of these two key elements of local infrastructure will attract investors to North Sulawesi, as well as freeing up the flow of trade into and out of Sulawesi in particular, and to Eastern Indonesia in general
The formation of the Province of Gorontalo was based on Law No 38, 2001 and has been in effect since February 2001
As a consequence, the size of the Province of North Sulawesi is now only 55% of what it once was, with Kabupaten Bolmong constituting more than half of this area (see Table 1)
Administratively, the province of North Sulawesi is divided into three kabupaten (Minahasa, Bolmong, Sangihe Talaud), two cities (Manado and Bitung), 72 kecamatan and 1,087 desa/kelurahan
Before the Province of Gorontalo was officially established, Kabupaten Gorontalo covered 44% of the area in the province of North Sulawesi
Administratively, the Province of Gorontalo covers Kabupaten Gorontalo, Kabupaten Boalemo, and Kota Gorontalo, as well as being divided into 21 kecamatan and 370 desa/kelurahan
Kabupaten Boalemo is an extension of Kabupaten Gorontalo, bordering the Province of Central Sulawesi, making it the largest kabupaten in this new province
At present, the Gorontalo provincial government is preparing its nominations for the election of the Governor
Simililarly, in Kabupaten Boalemo the nomination and selection process of the Bupati is currently taking place
The agricultural sector provides economic support for the majority of the population throughout both North Sulawesi and Gorontalo
Coconut and copra are an important source of income for almost 70% of the community in these two provinces
The area under coconut plantations amounts to 80% of the total area under plantations, with 45% of this in Kabupaten Minahasa
Kabupaten Minahasa is also the main producer of various important agricultural commodities, including, cloves, corn, vegetables, many varieties of fruit, fish and seaweed
Kabupaten Bolmong is the main rice producer in North Sulawesi
The Province of Gorontalo is well known for its beef cattle, marketed especially to Kalimantan
The local government hopes to attract investors to the region to develop industries manufacturing agricultural products and by-products
They have promised investors various concessions, including easy access to business locations and licenses
For example, the local government of Kabupaten Gorontolo has taken the initiative to build factories for the manufacture of nata de coco (a kind of gelatinous sweet made from fermented coconut juice), in an effort to attract investors as quickly as possible
Offering various business opportunities for the manufacture of other coconut by-products, as well as fishing, livestock, wood and rattan furniture, and cement
The local government of Kabupaten Minahasa has offered various investment opportunities, primarily for ocean industries
The supporting infrastructure for economic development in North Sulawesi and Gorontolo, apart from the Sam Ratulangi Airport and Bitung Port, also includes interregional roads and transport networks (urban and rural), both of which are generally considered to be in good condition
Local flights from Manado to Gorontolo (Jalaludin Airport) which ceased operation immediately after the onset of the economic crisis, are now operating again
In addition, there are a number of small ports spread across North Sulawesi and Gorontolo
3
The implementation of regional autonomy 
This section is intended to provide a brief account of the steps taken by local governments in this region to implement decentralization and regional autonomy
The relationship between the different levels of government
Since the new policy on regional autonomy came into effect, there has been evidence of a lack of clarity regarding the relationships between the various levels of government, especially between the provinces and the kabupaten and kota
This is mainly due to the content of Article 4, Clause 2 of Law No
22, 1999, which states that each autonomous region (province, kabupaten or kota) “stands alone and does not have a hierarchical relationship with any other (level of government)”
As a result, the following key issues have emerged 
there has been a loss of authority for the provincial governments
there is a clear lack of coordination in the creation of new local regulations (peraturan daerah – perda)
The system of local government and civil administration
In order to improve the provision of services from each local government agency, there is general agreement that a more streamlined system of local government is required to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness
However, such good intentions may be defeated by the reality that many civil servants and officials need to be provided with formal employment and official duties
As a result, the new local government administrations that have been formed are larger in size than under the previous system, even including the provincial level of government which now has more limited government authority according to Law No 22, 1999
As far as the civil service and appointments is concerned of the the putra daerah issue for the official heads of the region, is a long standing problem that first emerged long before the new Law No 22, 1999 about regional autonomy came into effect
However, officials at the lower levels of government, do not consider this to be a significant issue 
As many officials in this region (both at the province and kabupaten or kota levels of government) do not hail from the region
Local kabupaten and kota governments are generally receptive to the transfer of officials from other regions, provided that it is in accordance with local needs and does not affect DAU
Government offices must contribute to PAD
Local governments are tending to focus heavily on increasing PAD
This is apparent from the criteria already developed to evaluate the success of particular agencies based on their capacity to contribute to the local income
Several staff at the Trade Office have stated that their agency will be abolished if they do not make a significant contribution to regional revenue and their authority will be transferred to the Economics Bureau within the Local Secretariat
Other government offices have explained that if they are unable to make contributions to PAD, their operating budget will be delayed or the total amount reduced
Those respondents from outside government circles consider that the government's focus on PAD is unfair because regional autonomy policies should be aimed at increasing the provision of government services, rather than burdening the community
However, according to several government officials, PAD is required to increase those services provided to the community
Consequently, several businessmen have stated that they have no objections to taxes and levies collected by local government, but they have also warned the government not to create these charges in a manner that will ‘steal money from the community'
Local governments should focus on developing a business climate that will attract investment rather than an environment which will have the opposite effect
Public policy and community views and opinions
Informants from outside government that were interviewed for this study regard the mechanisms for decision-making about public policy issues as not providing sufficient scope to accommodate the wishes of the community
The attitude of local government and local assemblies (DPRD) still resembles a centralized system of government, and officials are largely authoritarian in their dealings with the community
When one particular NGO proposed draft legislation (Rancangan Perda – Raperda) about the management of natural resources, the reaction from the local government and the DPRD was to belittle them
One key official in the Provincial Government of North Sulawesi stated that “there is no procedure for NGOs to propose draft legislation”
Several staff members in the Legal Bureau explained that before proposing draft legislation to the DPRD, government officials often consult with various community groups, mainly staff from local institutes of higher education and NGO activists
However, after the legislation has been passed on to the DPRD, there are usually no further efforts to accommodate the wishes of the wider community
The DPRD merely carries out the formal process in accordance with assembly proceedings and in this way it can claim to represent the community
Consequently, several NGO activists hope that future legislation will guarantee greater public consultation on every occasion a decision is being considered which would have a direct impact on the daily life of the community
In other words, they hope that members of the local assembly will not formally represent the interests of the community, but that they will also represent them in a more substantial manner
II
LOCAL REGULATIONS
The implementation of decentralization and regional autonomy has resulted in several major changes in the way that local governments exercise their autonomous rights
One of these changes has been that local governments are creating a larger number of new local laws
On the one hand, this phenomenon can be viewed as a logical consequence of the implementation of regional autonomy, because the regions require a new legal basis to carry out these new powers
On the other hand, several community groups see the creation of these new laws as excessive, having a negative impact on the implementation of regional autonomy
As well as the various regulations that have been issued to manage the adminstrative changes resulting from regional autonomy, a large number of other regulations have also been issued allowing local governments to impose the largest possible number of new taxes and levies under the guise of increasing local revenues (Penerimaan Asli Daerah – Local Revenue)
Viewed from the perspective of the business world, some of these regulations involving taxes and levies constitute tariff barriers that distort market mechanisms
So far only the provincial governments have begun to create regulations that result in non-tariff barriers
However, there are also indications that kabupaten and kota governments are also proposing to create non-tariff regulations at this level
The following analysis presents a summary of the various local regulations that have already been ratified or are likely to be imposed in the near future in the Province of North Sulawesi, Kabupaten Minahasa, Kabupaten Bolaang Mongondow, and Kabupaten Gorontalo
1
The Provincial Level of Government 
Regulation about Local Taxes and Levies Although regional autonomy has been directed towards the kabupaten and kota governments, this does not mean provincial governments have no authority
This has been made clear in Government Regulation No.25, 2000 concerning Authority
Yet, in order to exercise their authority, the provincial governments still require significant funding, especially since they are now employing many civil servants who previously worked in the kanwil offices
According to Law No 22, 2000, all allocated funds resulting from policies are the responsibility of the central government
The case of the Province of North Sulawesi indicates that in practice this concept is not yet being implemented as intended
For the year 2001, the Provincial Government of North Sulawesi only received DAU amounting to Rp75.6 billion
The original level of DAU for this province was actually Rp120.9 billion, but Rp45.3 billion of these funds had to be transferred to the new Province of Gorontalo
However, the routine budgetary requirements for civil servant wages alone are estimated to be Rp198.3 billion
Consequently, if there is no increase in funding, the total amount of DAU provided will only be enough to cover the wages bill until June 2001
As a result, the Provincial Government of North Sulawesi has attempted to obtain additional funding from the central government, as well as trying to increase its own collection of local revenue
While the local governments' authority to raise local revenue is quite limited, most of the existing taxes and levies are based on Law No 18, 1997
Examples detailing three types of taxes and seven types of levies that have already been ratified, as well as three other types of new levies to become effective in the 2001 financial year
Local Regulation No 14, 2000 (Taxes and Levies for the Bunaken National Park), and Local Regulation No.16, 2000 (Supervision, Control of Stockpiling and Distribution of Fuel in the Province of North Sulawesi), are new local regulations that have not been targeted to provide local revenue for the 2001 financial year
The service administration charge as set out in Local Regulation No 1, 2000, is actually another form of ‘administration fee' that was previously abolished by Law No 18, 1997
These charges are considered to be potential sources of revenue for the provincial government
Service administration charges are applied to the following
1) official forms, application forms, and other printed materials;
2) permits, recommendations, and official statements; 
3) legal registration of official documents; and 
4) publishing invoices
All of these services are provided by various offices and work units of the Provincial Government of North Sulawesi, in accordance with the procedures on imposing levies outlined in Decree No.85, 2000 of the Governor of North Sulawesi (Implementation Guidelines for Local Regulation No.1, 2000)
The provincial government recognizes that Local Regulation No 17, 2000 about Service Levies for the Provision of Employment, is in direct conflict with Law No 18, 1997
However, the provincial government claims that entrepreneurs and partnerships that have been targeted have been involved in the discussion process both at the executive and legislative levels
According to local government officials, businesses generally support the implementation of this local regulation because they will indirectly benefit through the guarantee of continuing to receive projects from local government
The size of the charges has been set at 1.5% of the total project value, 10% of which will be passed on for the development of the Indonesian Construction Business Association (Gapensi)
Local Regulation No 2, 2000 (Extraction of Local Resources Levy) will also be revised to include those resources and facilities now controlled by the local government, which were previously managed by the “vertical agencies” of the central government
In relation to service administration in the fisheries sector (Local Regulation No 1, 2000), the local Office of Fisheries provides the following
fishing enterprise permits fishing permits recommendations for fishing enterprises recommendations for the feasibility of fishing enterprises recommendations for obtaining fishing permits official documentation for local fish transportation/origin of goods certificates and quality certificates for fishing produce 
The kabupaten and kota governments have also issued their own local regulations and consequently there is concern that there will be overlapping regulations originating from the different levels of government
At the same time, Local Regulation No 13, 2000 (Fishing Businesses in North Sulawesi) sets out charges on fishing outside of the authority that has been transferred to the kabupaten and kota governments
Several types of charges are regulated by this regulation, including
1
The Fish Produce levy is grouped together with the Forest Produce Levy (IHH)
The reason given for imposing this levy is fishing industry entrepreneurs exploit ocean produce, which are a form of state property
This levy is imposed on entrepreneurs and owners of vessels with a capacity of 10-30 tons gross and 30-90 horsepower, at the time they request their fishing permit
The tariff charged is 2.5% of estimated annual production and total sales
The revenue target from this levy is approximately Rp625 million
2
Levies for examining fish exports 
Fishing enterprises are also burdened with other charges, including levies related to arranging the licenses that are issued each time a ship departs, as well as the official documentation of gross tonnage and the measurement certificates that are required whenever a vessel is in operation
In order to achieve the increasingly large local revenue targets, several types of potential charges have already been issued as local regulations and are being revised in terms of the size of the tariffs
For example, the tariff on health services, transport route permits, and motor vehicle taxes, have all been increased
In addition, the Provincial Government of North Sulawesi is already planning to impose taxes and levies in various sectors that they still consider to be within their authority, for example
1
Draft Local Regulation, “Contributions for Quality Supervision and the Development of Clove and Nutmeg Production in the Province of North Sulawesi”
The source and target of these contributions are the traders in all local cloves and nutmegs which are either sold or transported from the region by land, sea, or air
Every trader will require an Official Permit for Inter-island Clove Transport (SKAP-C) or an Official Permit for Inter-Island Nutmeg Transport (SKAP-P), which are both to be issued by the local Office of Industry and Trade
Both these permits are to be issued after the traders provide evidence that the contribution has been paid
The size of the contribution will vary as follows
clove flowers Rp2,000/kg, clove stalks Rp1000/kg, the mace (i.e the inner casing of the nutmeg) Rp1,500/kg, contribution for nutmegs has not yet been determined
Since these contributions are actually obligatory charges, they are no different from the imposition of a tax
Consequently, the notion of these contributions as voluntary is fading
These levies are to be collected in collaboration with the kabupaten and kota governments
However, this plan has been rejected by the local governments of Kabupaten Sangir Talaud and Kabupaten Bolmong, because they are also in the process of formulating local regulations of a similar nature
Furthermore, the Kabupaten Minahasa government has similar plans, although it is still waiting to see the provincial government's formula for dividing the proceeds
If this formula is considered inadequate, the Kabupaten Minahasa government also intends to issue its own local regulations about clove levies
Apart from charges on cloves and nutmegs, levies of a similar nature will also be issued for trade in coconut and copra
Traders claim that copra will be hit with a levy of up to Rp100/kg
According to rumor, the funds collected will be directed towards assistance for internal refugees
2
There are also plans to control the felling of coconut trees because coconut timber has become a source of income for the local community and is developing into quite a significant business (furniture and handicrafts) in North Sulawesi
For each mature coconut tree felled, a levy of Rp5000/trunk will be imposed
The owner will be immediately required to plant a replacement
3
The regulation of charges in the forestry sector is still governed by provincial and central government regulations
Forestry Business Investment licenses are still issued by the provincial government
As well as this, the levy charged for the Provision of Forestry Resources (PSDH), which was previously known as the Forest Produce Levy (IHH), still falls under the authority of the central government and the kabupaten government only receives a share of the profits
To date, this is still a source of conflict between the central government, the provinces and the kabupaten
4
The Office of Industry and Trade in the Province of North Sulawesi has consulted with the central government Department of Industry and Trade in relation to planning the introduction of regulations on alcohol
5
In the manpower sector, the introduction of licenses for the use of foreign labour has also been considered
Consequently, the local Office of Manpower has made approaches to the Department of Manpower and Transmigration
Non-tariff Trade Regulation in the Regions One form of non-tariff barrier found in the Province of North Sulawesi is a regulation concerning pharmacies, outlined in the Governor's Decree No 4dz/03/891, 13 September 2001, Temporary Postponement of the Establishment of Large Pharmacies in North Sulawesi
The Province of North Sulawesi has placed restrictions on the ownership of pharmacies by those who do not reside in North Sulawesi, with the aim of protecting local entrepreneurs
The following is a summary of the contents of the Governor's Decree
1
Licenses for Large Pharmacies in the Province of North Sulawesi are only to be issued to those large businesses with a central office, which own or control assets, and whose owners reside in North Sulawesi
However, these licenses are not to be issued to those who reside outside of the Province of North Sulawesi, even though they may own and control assets within the province
2
Large pharmacies must own a building or business location in accordance with the stipulations on ownership status
3
Large local pharmacies are to be given priority as partners with the government in acquiring pharmacies with a value of up to Rp4 billion
4
The establishment of Large Pharmacy Branches has to be based on the recommendation of the North Sulawesi Association of Large Indonesian Pharmacies
5
The management of the North Sulawesi Association of Large Indonesian Pharmacies is to be comprised of members of the organization who originate from within the region
6
Apart from the managers, local residents are to be prioritized in the staffing of the Large Pharmacy Branches
7
The Large Pharmacy Branches will be encouraged to form partnerships with large local pharmacies in order to distribute their products throughout North Sulawesi
This situations suggests that there is some justification for emerging concerns regarding policies discriminating against people from outside the region in the interest of ‘putra daerah'
In addition, there are also indications of local regulations being issued that will create nontariff barriers in other fields and sectors
One example is the release of Governor Decree No 27, 22 March 2001, about the formulation of a team to conduct field studies and control the declining price of coconuts and copra in North Sulawesi
It appears that the demands of the coconut farmers who are members of the North Sulawesi Association of Coconut Farmers (Apeksu) have forced local government members to create this policy as a result of a protest against the local government on 12 March 2001 (see Box 1)
2
The Kabupaten Level 
Kabupaten Minahasa For the 2001 financial year, Kabupaten Minahasa received DAU of Rp260 billion, 
enough to fulfill both routine budgetary requirements and the development expenditure for the region
Similar to other kabupaten in the research sample, a large proportion of the DAU received by Kabupaten Minahasa has also been allocated to pay the wages of civil servants (Rp211.3 billion or 81% of the DAU)
Nominally, the development funds within the Local Government Budget (Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Daerah – APBD) have been increased compared to previous years
However, despite the adequate level of the DAU funds received by the Kabupaten Minahasa government, in reality this has not reduced the enthusiasm of the local government to find ways to exploit sources of local revenue
After the local government completed several local regulations dealing with local institutions, including village institutions, it has given immediate priority to the creation of new local regulations to raise levies
Kabupaten Minahasa is aiming to collect Rp15.9 billion in local revenue for the 2001 financial year, which is more than twice the Rp7.4 billion collected in the previous year
This local revenue target is not intended to simply finance the routine requirements of the government, since approximately 20% of the funds will also be allocated for development expenditure
In order to reach this local revenue target, appeals have been made to the relevant technical offices of the local government
For the present time, it is hoped that the main sectors contributing to local revenue will include fisheries, forestry and manpower
During the year 2000, the Kabupaten Minahasa government ratified 35 new local regulations, authorized with reference to Law No 22, 1999
Sixteen of these cover local taxes and levies, six of which are revised local regulations
The local government hopes that the new local regulations can be implemented effectively in the year 2001, even though there is an ongoing debate with the provincial government about who has the authority over several of these levies
In addition, six categories of local taxes and eight categories of local levies have been created in accordance with Law No.18, 1997 (Local Taxes and Levies), these levies have already been implemented and the charges are being collected
In relation to the creation of new local regulations, the DPRD has also taken the initiative by releasing Local Government Regulations No 11 and No 19, 2000
Local Government Regulation No 11, 2000 covers the conduct of horse racing in Tompaso
This regulation was created in order to anticipate illegal gambling which continues to flourish
Although its ratification was actually opposed by local assembly leaders, it seems that this was ignored by local council members
Meanwhile, Local Government Regulation No 19, 2000 concerns the provision of licenses to investors from Singapore for building and managing gambling facilities used by wealthier members of the community on one of the remote islands in Kecamatan Likupang
Levies for the provision of administrative services are set out in Local Government Regulation No 22, 2000, which constitutes a reintroduction of administrative charges that had been abolished in accordance with Law No 18, 1997 (as observed earlier, the Provincial Government of North Sulawesi has also carried out similar procedures)
This regulation applies to various types of services such as the provision of forms, applications or other printed materials, the provision of licenses, recommendations, official statements, legal documents, and other administrative services, provided by all offices of the Kabupaten Minahasa government
This regulation sets out approximately 200 types of administrative services, according to the form and the size of the tariff for each service
Kabupaten Minahasa government considers the imposition of these charges to be quite rational because of the clear provision of services
Meanwhile, the recipients of these services, to date, have not felt overburdened by these charges
Furthermore, the charges are official, and consequently this provides a greater guarantee that the funds collected will be passed on to the local treasury
As previously noted, the fisheries sector constitutes one of the most potential sources of revenue in Kabupaten Minahasa
Taxes and levies have been applied to almost all activities in this sector through Local Government Regulations 
Further information about the type and size of the charges in the fisheries sector is provided in Table 5
The charges in the fisheries sector are stipulated by Local Government Regulation No 22, 2000 (Administrative Services), and cover 13 types of services
Several of these are detailed under the single banner of ‘levies', making it difficult to distinguish the purpose of one levy from another
At the time the implementation of Local Government Regulation No 29, 2000 (Shipping Facility Levies) was introduced, there was sufficient opportunity for the owners of business enterprises and fishing vessels to protest because the local government did not possess and was not able to provide satisfactory facilities for fishing vessels
However, the local government continued to approach businesses with the explanation that their contributions are important for the development of Kabupaten Minahasa
Originally, the charges in the fishing industry amounted to 5% of the total value of transactions at the fish auction, including a levy for the Fish Auction Facility (TPI)
However, because these facilities were inadequate and could not be used, the fishermen were strongly opposed to the size of this levy
Consequently, the levy was reduced to 2.5%
It is hoped that the funds received can be used to improve the fish auction facilities
The local government recognizes the difficulty of implementing levies in accordance with existing tariffs, especially fishing levies
For example, the Inengo Fish Auction, which has become the main base for seven fishing boat fleets, only earns Rp6 million per year in annual revenue
Whereas according to the total catch, annual levies could reach up to Rp50 million
This has resulted in a lack of enthusiasm on the part of the local government to develop the Fish Auction Facilities because the local fishermen have never made maximum use of the facility
At present, the taxes and levies which fall within the authority of the local Office of Industry and Trade, are only related to issuing Industry Licenses (SIUI) and Proof of Industry Registration (TDI) for businesses and investment, as well as Business Licenses (SIUP) and Proof of Business Registration (TDP)
The tariffs charged to obtain SIUI and TDI are determined according to the amount invested, and are usually between Rp50,000 and Rp2 million
Meanwhile, the levies for obtaining an SIUP and TDP are determined according to the scale and the type of the trading business, amounting to between Rp25,000 and Rp250,000
There is a special levy for Warehouse Registration, which has been set at Rp1,000/m²
While information about the size of these charges has not been widely publicized, they have been officially effective since March 2001
To date, business people have yet to strongly object to the implementation of these charges
The various charges which fall within the authority of the local Office of Transport and Telecommunications are set out in Local Government Regulation No 26, 2000
This regulation outlines the various taxes and levies on services related to land and sea transport, as well as post and telecommunications
However, the only charges that have already been effectively implemented are several categories of levies in the land transport sub-sector
The levies in the sea transport sub-sector, as well as post and telecommunications, have not yet been implemented, as a result of various obstacles including problems with facilities and human resources
Another function of the local Office of Transport and Communications is their authority to issue vehicle registrations (STNK) and drivers licenses' (SIM), previously carried out by the police
Meanwhile, this office believes that charges related to the operation of weigh bridges should be handled by the central government
There is concern that if this authority is handed over to either the provincial or kabupaten governments it will become nothing other than a source of local revenue while the primary function of the weigh bridges which is to monitor and control the weight of passing vehicles will be ignored
Attempts to seek new sources of local revenue continue on the part of the Kabupaten Minahasa government
The results of a study carried out by a local team investigating previous and potential local regulations, estimate that there are approximately 89 potential sources of local revenue in Kabupaten Minahasa
Several technical offices of the local government have planned and prepared draft legislation creating new taxes and levies within their own area of authority
The various forms of taxes and levies that have been considered or formulated by the local government, as well as any relevant problems are listed below according to each relevant sector
1) In the plantation sector, the Kabupaten Minahasa government has drawn up draft legislation about levies on trade in cloves and coconuts
However, the provincial government had also designed similar regulations, arguing that trade in these commodities involves authority across kabupatens and it can help to avoid the implementation of overlapping charges
Consequently, Kabupaten Minahasa cancelled its plan on the understanding that the kabupaten will receive a share of the provincial government revenue from these charges
The potential for trading in these two commodities in Kabupaten Minahasa is quite significant, since the production of cloves can reach 10,000tons/year and copra 120,000 tons/year
The local Office of Plantations has also proposed the creation of levies on the felling of coconut trees
Although the draft regulation has already been prepared, its legal basis remains weak and uncertain
The government's Legal Bureau has not yet agreed to the draft regulation
Kabupaten Minahasa argues that these levies are justified because there are approximately 13 million coconut trees, 7 million of which are already old and require replanting
2) In the food crops sector, the Kabupaten Minahasa government has already prepared draft regulations setting out levies on the distribution of vegetables, similar to the levies on coconuts and cloves
3) The manpower sector is also considered to have the potential to make a contribution to local revenue through the organization of permits for foreign labour, which to date has been arranged at the provincial level
4) The authority over the forestry sector is still being debated with the central government
However, the Kabupaten Minahasa government has created a draft regulation about forestry by-products
5) Regulations for the mining sector have not yet been prepared because they are dependent on a contract between the government and PT
Newmont Minahasa Raya which will be finalized by the end of 2003
6) The local Office of Trade has also been given the task of contributing to local revenue in Kabupaten Minahasa
It is recognized that this office still has significant potential for producing revenue, although efforts need to be made to identify accurately the targets for these taxes and levies, bearing in mind that there are several forms of overlapping authority between the different technical offices of the local government
The Office of Trade also believes that the provincial government will give them tasks to carry out if the levies on inter-island and inter-regional trade in cloves and coconuts become effective
The role of the kabupaten government will be to issue official statements certifying the origin of goods being traded
As in the forestry sector, the debate in the trade sector is still continuing between the kabupaten and provincial governments over who has the authority to charge levies on particular potential sources of local revenue
For example, in the area of testing and certifying the calibration of instruments, the provincial government is concerned that the kabupaten government will take over its role in taking measurements and calibration
The local Office of Trade in Kabupaten Minahasa believes that these tasks should preferably be performed by the provincial government, bearing in mind that the kabupaten government does not possess the instruments and expertise required
However, the kabupaten government wishes to obtain a share of the revenue from the provision of this service
7) Charges already implemented by other kabupaten and kota governments have also been considered by the Kabupaten Minahasa government
For example, Kota Manado has already ratified a levy on televisions and it is possible that this will be imitated by Kabupaten Minahasa
The potential to earn additional revenue can be realized through levies on peddlers, (licenses for door-to-door salesmen have already been covered by Local Government Regulation No 22, 2000), company income tax, as well as levies on tailors, beauty salons, and hairdressers
In Kabupaten Minahasa there was no evidence of any regulations that introduce non-tariff barriers
Several existing regulations only consist of stipulations about regulating services, and detemining the sources and targets of the particular taxes and levies
As explained previously, all of these efforts are aimed at locating various sources of local revenue
The Bupati and local government officials are aware that in order to attract investors to Kabupaten Minahasa, they have to improve the provision of facilities and infrastructure as well as concessions for obtaining permits and licenses
Consequently, the Kabupaten Minahasa government has guaranteed that they will speed up the process of organizing licenses through a more proactive approach 
The time required to process licenses should be no longer than two weeks
However, their desire to attract investors is undermined by the enthusiasm to create new local regulations in every sector of the local economy in order to increase local revenue
There is concern that the creation of a positive local business environment will be increasingly difficult to achieve because the DPRD will also be assessing the performance of the local government
Consequently, it seems that in the short term the importance of increasing local revenue will be given priority over the long term objective of improving the business environment so that is free from distortion
Kabupaten Bolaang Mongondow (Bolmong) While the DAU received by Kabupaten Bolmong for the 2001 financial year amounted to Rp140.8 billion, the local government still considers this amount to be inadequate because the funds required for routine expenditure has been budgeted at Rp111.3 billion
Meanwhile, according to information obtained from the central government, if the DAU is sufficient to meet a region's routine expenditure requirements, this region will not receive any additional funding
In order to cover any budgetary shortfall, the opportunity remains to develop local revenue as a source of funding
There are six categories of taxes and 15 categories of levies (see Table 6) included in the Kabupaten Bolmong budget for the 2001 financial year
All of these taxes and levies are targeted to contribute an additional Rp3.8 billion to the regional budget, a funding increase of 41% from the previous year which amounted to Rp2.7 billion
The six taxes were determined in accordance with Law No 18, 1997
For example, the Ground and Surface Water tax has not been officially revoked in accordance with Law No 34, 2000 so that this authority can be passed on to the provincial government, because the kabupaten government is still awaiting instructions about its implementation
Meanwhile, apart from the Building License levy, the Recreation and Sports Ground levy, and the levy on Identification Cards and Public Certificate Renewals, several other new and amended levies were ratified in the year 2000
Three other Local Government Regulations No18, No 19, and No 20, 2000, just became effective for the 2001 financial year
These three regulations were an initiative of the DPRD, based on the results of a study comparing different regions
The process of ratifying these regulations was carried out quickly because there was no opposition from the different factions in the parliament, only the view of the executive
Until now, there has been no opposition from the community regarding these three levies
The following is a summary of their content
1
Local Government Regulation No 18, 2000 (Use of Land Licenses and Levies), regulates and determines the size of the levies for an area of land to be used for a certain period of time includes the collection of forest produce, the construction of electricity lines, telephone lines, connecting cables, and water pipelines
Consequently, the main targets of this levy are those State-owned Enterprises (Badan Usaha Milik Negara - BUMN) which seek to obtain the right to use the land, including enterprises such as PLN and PT Telkom
State-owned Enterprises such as these usually make decisions in Jakarta (at the company headquarters); consequently it may be difficult for the kabupaten government to process their claims
2
The content of Local Government Regulation No 19, 2000 (The Reissue of Maps and Administrative Services Levy) are not as detailed as the regulations created by Kabupaten Minahasa (Local Government Regulation No 22, 2000), even though the type of services provided are very similar
Details of the scale of levies have only been determined in general, based on the type of services to be provided
3
Local Government Regulation No 20, 2000 (Licenses to Exploit Forestry By- Products) determines the size of the levy to exploit rattan, resin and other nontimber products
There are two types of levies
a) levies for the receipt of licenses to exploit forestry by-products at Rp100/m²; and 
b) levies for the collection of rattan and resin forestry by-products
At present, the Kabupaten Bolmong government has already started to prepare various other forms of levies which will appear in local regulations
These efforts have been fully supported by the DPRD
It is expected that the newly formed offices of the local government will be able to achieve their pre-determined revenue targets
According to the Legal Affairs Section, 23 draft regulations have already been prepared that were formulated by the various technical offices of the local government
divided into two groups; nine draft regulations about general service levies and 14 draft regulations covering licensing service levies (see Table 7)
Four of these draft regulations amend existing regulations
Transport Route Levies, Extraction of Local Resources Levies, Provision of Public Certificates Levies (previously this was grouped together with Identity Card Renewal Levies), and Building License Levies
The local treasury office expects that approximately 18 of these 23 draft regulations will soon be discussed and ratified by the DPRD, so that the implementation of these levies can be included in the amendments to the Regional Budget for the 2001 financial year
If these charges become effective, the local government is optimistic that the income obtained will enable them to exceed their local revenue target
The Bupati is continuing to encourage offices of the local government who have yet to formulate draft regulations about taxes and levies, to consider the various opportunities they have to locate new sources of local revenue
However, the Bupati has also made an appeal that these local regulations should not contradict any laws of higher authority and that this search for local revenue should not be a burden, or create difficulties for the wider community
The local Office of Industry and Trade in Kabupaten Bolmong has already proposed four draft regulations based on its authority
Industry Sector Levies, Levies on Licenses in the Trade Sector, Control of the Distribution of Goods levies, and Levies on Arranging Calibration Services
the Office of Industry and Trade did not resubmit the draft regulations immediate processing
On the one hand, the local Office of Industry and Trade recognizes that the kabupaten and kota governments do not have the extensive equipment and expertise required in this field
On the other hand, these operational services are already located at the kabupaten and kota level
Consequently, the provincial government is of the opinion that the authority to carry out these activities should preferably remain in the hands of the kabupaten and kota governments with continued technical support from the provincial government if required
Several interesting issues have resulted from the contents of those draft regulations involving taxes and levies which have been formulated by the Kabupaten Bolmong government
1
In the forestry sector, almost all forest products until now have not been burdened with taxes and levies, including timber produce on private land
2
In addition, in the plantation sector a draft regulation has been prepared on Licenses and Plantation Management Levies which determines levies for plantation management licenses and levies on the output of plantation
A plantation produce levy on all types of commodities
2.5%/kg of the sales price; An equipment and infrastructure levy, as well as a levy on machinery used to process plantation produce
Rp500,000/year; Levies on middle-men purchasing more than 1 ton
Rp500,000/ton; A vanilla levy, where the volume of sales is below 500 kg
Rp500,000, above 500 kg
Rp1 million
It is estimated that the imposition of these levies will overlap with provincial levies already charged on cloves and nutmeg made effective by the Official Permit for Inter-Island Cloves/Nutmeg Transport (SKAP-C/P)
It seems that the local Office of Plantations in Kabupaten Bolmong is not especially concerned about the possibility that the same object will be twice subject to the same levy
all commodities originating from the region can be charged levies
The draft regulation stipulates administrative sanctions of 2% per month if levies are not paid in full and on time
3
At present, 80% of the levies imposed in the fisheries sector that are imposed on fishermen and traders at the fish auction facility, have been handed over to the provincial government
If the draft regulation concerning Levies for Fishing Enterprises in Kabupaten Bolmong is ratified, then the provincial government regulations should automatically be abolished
According to the draft regulations, the levies cover fishing enterprise permits, fishing permits, fish auctions and wholesale trading licenses, as well as estuarine and fresh water aquaculture
This draft regulation was finalized in February 2001, but it has not yet been discussed within the DPRD
In determining fish auction tariffs, the local Office of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries has based its calculations based on prices below the market rates (approximately 70- 80% of the market price) due to recent large fluctuations in prices
It is hoped that such a flexible determination of the levy will ensure that the income of both fishermen and traders is not adversely affected
The head of the local Office of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries has stated that when draft regulation was discussed with the fishing communities in 10 kecamatan, its contents were readily accepted
Officials always stress that the success of regional autonomy very much depends on the participation of the community, and the guarantee that all revenue collected from levies will be passed on to the local treasury office
4
The draft regulation on Third Party Contributions stresses that third party contributions are voluntary and can be in the form of gifts, donations, property for religious use, grants, and other contributions
Furthermore, it is stressed that each contribution from an enterprise must be accompanied by a letter of recommendation from the Bupati, otherwise it will not be accepted
5
The kabupaten government also plans to impose levies on the activities of cooperatives
This is included in a draft regulation on Cooperative Services, and Small to Medium-sized Enterprise Levies
6
Within the draft regulation on Agricultural Extension Work Levies, it has been determined that three types of services will incur levies
individual and group extension work services, extension work consulting services, and determining the methodology for carrying out extension work services
Several offices of the local government believe that they have not yet made the most of opportunities to maximize the collection revenue in the region
there is a lack of available infrastructure as well as inadequate human resources and local government officials to carry out this task
For example, the new potential of the local Office of Post and Telecommunications, to charge taxes and levies includes its authority over road transport and communications
However, the office has not yet begun to tap sea transportation or post and telecommunications
There are still many opportunities for the local Office of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries to charge levies on ocean activities, the local kabupaten government has already started identifying potential targets for levies
The local Office of Industry and Trade and the local Office of Fisheries is aware that the pressure on every local government office and technical agency to produce new local regulations may lead to duplication of levies between these offices
Consequently, a joint inter-agency forum is required so that the relevant offices can communicate with each other and effectively coordinate the levies already in operation as well as those which are planned
Decisions about which local government office should have the task of collecting the levies doesnot need to become an issue
it is important that all funds obtained are passed on to the local treasury office
In order to monitor the burden of similar levies imposed by neighboring kabupaten, the Kabupaten Bolmong government also wishes to coordinate with the relevant offices of the other local governments in the region
At this early stage it is apparent that similar levies will be imposed on goods and services being transported across various kabupaten, especially where each local government is establishing collection posts on the roads between the kabupaten and kota
The Kabupaten Bolmong government is convinced that it is most unlikely that the community will reject these local regulations and the taxes and charges that are imposed, because various sections of the community were involved in the formulation process
According to the Head of the Legal Affairs Section, NGOs, academics, and entrepreneurs have been involved in the discussions during the initial period of preparation, as well as the discussions at the executive and legislative level
Through this process it is hoped that any community grievances and dissatisfaction, above all concerning the duty to pay the charges resulting from these new regulations, will be minimized
In Kabupaten Bolmong, as yet there are no local government regulations which involve non-tariff barriers, even though in reality those local regulations involving levies will be followed by non-tariff stipulations such as licenses and feasibility documentation
However, the primary focus of local government discussions at present is on the subject of the levies themselves and not on the details
The proposals for the levy targets have in fact come from business people themselves such as construction entrepreneurs (Gapensi), will be further discussed in Chapter 3
Kabupaten Gorontalo, in the Province of Gorontalo In order to implement regional autonomy, Kabupaten Gorontalo was allocated funding of Rp149 billion
Based on this allocation, a regional budget was set at Rp159.4 billion
A large proportion of the DAU funding (Rp128 billion) will be used for routine expenditure, and consequently the development budget activities are quite limited
The Kabupaten Gorontalo government has made similar efforts to other regions to increase local revenue
If the eventual total revenue collected for the 2000 financial year only amounts to Rp3,9 billion, then the target for the 2001 financial year will be set at Rp5,1 billion
To achieve this local revenue target, and to strengthen its financial base, Kabupaten Gorontalo has created numerous local regulations concerning levies
During the year 2000, 22 such local regulations were ratified, some of these amendments of previous legislation
there are a total of 32 local regulations concerning taxes and levies that are already effective (see Table 8), 
Including six regional taxes determined in accordance with Law No.18, 1997
Local Regulations No.62 through 67, ratify new levies
the revenue that will result has just been included in the revenue target for the 2001 financial year
So far, there has been no evidence of any conflict of interest arising between the kabupaten and kota governments and the Provincial Government of Gorontalo over the types of levies to be raised
At the time this study was under taken, the new province, Gorontalo, had yet to select a governor or the members of the local assembly and consequently, local regulations had not been issued
The following constitutes a short summary of the contents of those local regulations that are already in effect in Kabupaten Gorontalo and the problems that have arisen, based on sectors being regulated
(1) The forestry sector is covered by Local Government Regulations No 12, No 62, No 63 and No 66, 2000
Local regulation No.12, 2000 determines the size of the levies on the provision of licenses for the collection of forest by-products such as rattan, resin, candle nuts, palm fibers, honey and other non-timber forest products
The size of the levy for a rattan license for example, is Rp15,000 per ton, to be paid by the entrepreneurs in the rattan industry
Payment is determined according to a six-monthly quota system; if the agreed quota is not completed then a license is automatically extended
Meanwhile, the levies on firewood which are covered by local regulation No 62, 2000 are only paid by large-scale consumers, for example those using firewood for rattan processing and lime kilns
(2) The livestock sector is dealt with by Local Regulation No.64 (Livestock Security, Supervision and Development Levies)
This regulation covers the following
- The Registration of Livestock Enterprises, where every small-holder livestock business is regulated by the Head of the Region, and every livestock entrepreneur must register their business
- Every establishment exporting or importing livestock, animal by-products or stock feed is required to have a permit
- Livestock producers or entrepreneurs in the industry are required to pay a levy for Security, Supervision and Guidance Services for the industry
For large animals such as cattle, water buffalo, and horses
(a) there is a tariff of Rp5,000 per head, for the Security and Supervision of imports and exports as well as livestock health examinations
(b) there are livestock guidelines in the form of import and export licenses, Rp45,000 per head of livestock
The process of obtaining a license to export requires a letter of recommendation from the Bupati
Once approved, the permit is then issued by the local Office of Animal Husbandry at a rate of Rp50,000 per head of livestock
Another levy imposed in this sector is the livestock market levy (managed by the Market Office), incurring a charge of Rp10,000 for every animal sold
There are also levies at the village level for issuing Ownership of Livestock Certificates, the size of the levy varying between villages
(3) The target of charges in the plantations sector such as those set out in Local Regulation No 65, 2000 (Plantation Enterprise Security, Supervision and Guidance Levies) includes the following
every coconut palm felled for commercial use will incur a levy of Rp2,500
recipients of security, supervision, and guidance services pay a tariff which is determined according to the type of seedling being planted
The size of the tariffs range from Rp10 to Rp50 per seedling or graft, except for ginger that incurs a tariff of Rp150 per kg
The tariff on the registration of small-holder and large plantation enterprises is determined according to the production capacity which is approximately Rp50,000 per year
There is a section of the regulation concerning the felling of coconut palms that provides certain limitations
To retain a balance in the overall population of these trees, only coconut trees that are no longer productive can be felled and this must be preceded by a field officer's inspection
These stipulations are considered far too constraining for coconut plantation owners who argue that they are capable of making their own rational decisions about felling
In addition, bearing in mind the extent of the coconut plantations and the limited number of available inspection officers, it seems unlikely that this regulation will be effective
(4) In Kabupaten Gorontalo, levies for administrative services and reprinting maps are set out respectively in Local Regulation No 66 and Local Regulation No 71
The scale of these tariffs is determined using a simple system as follows
Rp3,000 for each type of form or other printed material; 
(b) Rp10,000 for each type of permit; 
(c) Rp5,000 for a letter of recommendation, official statement or registration; 
(d) Rp3,000 for any other type of document; and 
(e) Rp3,000 for the legal certification of a document
While it was intended to create 75 new local during the year 2001, only 18 were successfully formulated prior to May 2001
These are presented in Table 9
a summary of the content of these local regulations is presented in Table 1 in the appendix
At present, the remaining regulations are still being considered by local government offices with reference to their authority under regional autonomy and the scope of the authority of other relevant offices
Many of the local regulations which concern taxes and levies, both those which have already been ratified as well as those which are soon to come into effect, are not in accordance with the Kabupaten Gorontalo government's plan to attract local and international investors
According to the list of draft regulations, it appears that there is not one area of economic activity free of tariffs
Several of these new tariffs are actually a reapplication of tariffs that were abolished under Law No.18, 1997 (Local Taxes and Levies)
There are concerns that the services to be provided in return for each levy paid is merely a formality that will soon be forgotten, as the local government tends to place more emphasis on revenue collection
Several staff from the technical offices who have been given the task of collecting taxes and levies admit that they face a dilemma in attempting to balance their efforts to increase services with their efforts to obtain local revenue
Meanwhile, a fundamental problem which cannot be ignored is the difficulties faced by the local governments guaranteeing the welfare of their employees
In one way, it is understandable if local offices tend focus on increasing the collection of revenue because there may be serious consequences if revenue targets are not achieved
senior officials could lose their positions, the office's routine budgets may be cut, or there could be mergers with other offices or agencies
This problem continues to have a negative impact in the implementation of new local regulations
one of the non-tariff barriers to be ratified by the Kabupaten Gorontalo government limits the felling of coconut palms
In the future, it seems likely that regulations of this type will increase
There are already indications of nontariff barriers in the fisheries sector with a proposal to limit the number of new investors
Similarly, in the livestock sector, Kabupaten Gorontalo is presently investigating implementing a livestock quota system, arguing that it will help maintain self-sustaining livestock populations
III
THE BUSINESS WORLD AND LOCAL REGULATIONS 1
Businesses in the Agricultural Sector Clove Commodities 
The Cloves Marketing Board (BPPC) was in operation, the selling price of cloves declined sharply for the farmers, to the point where it fell below the costs of production
In addition to these low prices, farmers were not free to sell their cloves because BPPC held a monopoly over the clove trading system, enforcing various requirements which in the end left farmers at a loss
This situation left many farmers unable to maintain their clove plantations and as a result there was a sharp decline in clove production
One trader from Kabupaten Minahasa estimated that present day clove production levels were 25% of the production levels that were achieved during more prosperous times
In the past farmers could produce 4 tons of dry cloves from a primary clove harvest in comparison to the present day 1 ton
It is estimated that only 30% of the remaining clove trees in North Sulawesi are still producing cloves
One of the things that has pleased farmers with the continuation of the reforms is the increase in the price of cloves as a result of the dissolution of BPPC and the depletion of existing clove stocks
The current price of cloves is Rp70,000 per kg
However, after the costly process of picking and drying (which can cost as much as Rp20,000 per kg), the farmers net return amounts to Rp50.000 per kg
Nowadays, the clove market is no longer hampered by such a trading system so the farmers are free to choose when and to whom they wish to sell their cloves
Trading Patterns
After the dissolution of BPPC, clove trading patterns in North Sulawesi were influenced by cigarette factory agents in Java
Merchants would sell their cloves to larger traders in Manado who would then sell them to the cigarette company representatives in the same city
There were also individual buyers operating not as agents for particular cigarette companies but who purchased cloves to sell to smaller cigarette factories in Surabaya
The purchasing prices of these two groups were in competition with each other
The distribution channel was as follows
farmers → merchants → larger traders → and cigarette company agents (like Gudang Garam, Dji Sam Soe, Bentoel and Djarum)
Generally, traders were bound into a contract system, meaning that they were required to sell their cloves to the cigarette companies providing the capital
Levies
At present, local regulations are not causing market distortion and farmers are so far not required to pay any levies to the local government
They are yet to receive precise information about whether a clove levy will be imposed in the future
However, in several villages in Kabupaten Minahasa there is a plan to impose a levy of Rp100-200 on every kg of cloves traded as a means of raising local revenue for the villages concerned
Traders have proposed that if the local government were to impose a levy on cloves, cigarette factory representatives or the agents taking the cloves out of the region should bear the costs
If this were to occur, the levy process could easily be controlled and implemented
Levies that large clove traders in Manado are required to pay include
a) levies on fiscal permits;
b) waste disposal; 
c) an advertisement tax (if there is one); 
d) levies on fire extinguisher permits (again, if those exist); 
e) levies on five year trade permit extensions (at a cost of Rp800,000); and 
f) extensions on permits to trade in certain locations, also levied every five years
Coconut Commodities Coconut and Copra Prices
According to farmers in North Sulawesi, it is no longer possible for the coconut industry to remain as their primary source of income, since the price of coconuts has fallen below the costs of production
Farmers sell whole coconuts for Rp275-290 per kg, while coconut flour factories (for example, PT
Unicotin) only pay Rp300 per kg
Added to this, copra is sold by farmers for Rp90,000 per 100 kg, while the factory's purchasing prices are between Rp115,000 and Rp140,000 per 100 kg
If the present day prices of copra are compared to 1998, when prices were Rp450,000 per 100 kg, it would appear that there has been a drop of 70%
As a result, thousands of copra production enterprises in small-holder plantations throughout North Sulawesi have been abandoned by the farmers
Trading Patterns
Copra trade in North Sulawesi could be described as having only one buyer, because a large proportion of the copra produced (around 75%) is bought by PT Bimoli, a factory that produces cooking oil
As a result many believe that the price of copra in the region is very much determined by PT Bimoli's purchasing price policies
In purchasing copra, PT Bimoli does not have a cooperative agreement that binds certain middleman traders
Aside from purchasing copra independently, PT Bimoli also takes advantage of a contract purchasing system, whereby a specific price is set for a two-week period
If traders are unable to fulfil their contracts they incur a fine in the form of a reduction in the contract price
Varying opinions on the decline in copra prices
According to one entrepreneur, copra prices declined as a result of the drop in world prices (evident at the Rotterdam stock exchange), not as a result of PT.Bimoli's role in the industry
If the price of PT Bimoli's products on the international market drop, the price of copra purchased from both traders and farmers will also fall
This view was further substantiated by another North Sulawesi copra trader
In determining the purchasing price of copra, PT Bimoli carried out basic calculations as follows
the price of Bitung's freight on board (FOB) x exchange rate x 60% (1 kg of copra = 0.6 kg of oil)
Therefore, the key to these calculations is the FOB, which is essentially equivalent to the international price
As a result, the local government's plan to fix the basic price of copra does not effectively take into account the fact that the price of copra is dependant on international prices
In fact, farmers, copra traders and the local North Sulawesi Government could also calculate these prices independently by simply monitoring Bitung's FOB on TVRI's 7.30am program ‘Just For Two Hours'
According to one copra trader, if this was to be done, there would be no need for debate over PT Bimoli's purchasing prices
With this process the local government could estimate the real price of copra and indirectly monitor PT Bimoli's decisions on copra prices
Apeksu, however, does not accept the above reasoning
Apeksu, and the various groups supporting the association, have accused PT Bimoli of arbitrarily regulating copra prices
According to the laws of supply and demand, prices should be quite reasonable as PT Bimoli's factory capacity is up to 750 tons of copra a day and only 60% of that amount can be provided by North Sulawesi
PT Bimoli's status as sole buyer has allowed the company to control the purchasing prices of copra
In relation to the purchasing price, Apeksu has made a number of criticisms of PT Bimoli
PT Bimoli is quick to adjust its purchasing prices if the price of copra declines
But very slow to make the appropriate adjustments if prices rise
PT Bimoli imports copra from Central Sulawesi and the Moluccas, 
The company is far too rigid in using the FOB prices
North Sulawesi's Local Chamber of Commerce is one of the groups which has supported Apeksu's criticisms
Yet members of the local Chamber of Commerce themselves admit that they cannot do much to change the copra price situation
According to one Local Chamber of Commerce board member, PT Bimoli is at the root of the copra price crisis
He added that ‘on the pretext of following the dictates of the market, they are able to regulate prices as they wish
Even if the entire community united against them, they would not have a chance'
According to estimates, PT Bimoli has already invested up to Rp80 billion in the local copra industry
Several years ago, another independent entrepreneur invested Rp5 billion in this sector, but was later quietly bought out by PT Bimoli
Apeksu
An attempt to help farmers
Apeksu was formed in the year 2000
Presently, it has representatives in several primary copra-producing villages
They fight on behalf of the farmers and their best interests, because coconuts constitute an important source of revenue for the majority of North Sulawesi's farmers
The following considerations were taken into account when Apeksu was formed
1
The implementation of regional autonomy had yet to have a positive effect on coconut farmers
2
North Sulawesi's local government was yet to come up with a policy that supported coconut farmers
Despite the fact that this group makes up a large portion of all the farmers in North Sulawesi
3
The farmers represented by Apeksu did not agree with PT Bimoli's justification for the fall in copra prices
The farmers were sure that PT Bimoli had manipulated the situation to keep purchasing prices down
4
The pre-payment system (that is purchasing copra from the farmers before it is even harvested) remains in use, leaving farmers in a vulnerable position
5
The plan was to produce membership shares at a price of Rp50,000 per share with every member owning a minimum of five shares
To attract the attention of local government, as well as PT Bimoli and the general public, Apeksu organized a protest involving coconut farmers in Manado
These farmers protested in front of the North Sulawesi Governor's office with 50 ox-drawn carts
When the opportunity arose, they presented their 10 demands to the local government, as outlined in Chapter II (see Box 1)
The governor responded to the protest by accommodating a few of the farmers demands 
He issued a decree forming a team to study the price of coconuts
The aim of this team was to reach an agreement on fixing the price of coconuts by involving both the farmers and the purchasers (including PT Bimoli)
A draft regulation was prepared to collect levies on copra coming from outside of North Sulawesi (for example, the Moluccas)
The governor also announced that he would fight to obtain funds for the rehabilitation of coconut plantations and a share of both the value-added tax and income tax from the central government
Levies
Coconut farmers and copra producers have acknowledged that they have yet to be subjected to local government levies, even though regional autonomy has already been implemented
Therefore, they hope that when the local and village governments request contributions from them, they are only voluntary and are aimed at creating concrete benefits
For example, there are three truckweighing stations between Kecamatan Amurang and Bitung
At each of these stations, trucks with a 7 ton capacity are immediately charged Rp3,000 without even checking if their load exceeds the truck's
There are various levies which must be paid by large companies
As reported by PT Unicotin staff, these include
levies on staff retrenchment, 
tariffs on fire extinguisher checks, and 
levies on permits for employing foreign staff
The reasons behind the retrenchment levies are unclear 
Although, there are obvious reasons for fire extinguisher checks, in practice, these are never carried out
Levies for the employment of foreign staff are the responsibility of the companies
The problem is not so much the number of the existing levies, but the time that is required for these administrative procedures which often results in illegal payments
2
Businesses in the Fisheries Sector 
Fisherman's Activities
Fishing that takes place in the ocean waters around North Sulawesi is generally carried out by fishermen and/or boat crews who are dependant on boat owners or those with capital
Tuna and flying fish are the most common varieties caught
A large proportion of the fish is sold to cold storage or export companies due to the large number of buyers there is room for considerable competition
In May 2001 in Bitung, the sale price for poor quality tuna and skipjack was around Rp6,000 per kg, average quality sold for Rp9,000 per kg, and high quality produce reached Rp12,000 per kg
On average each catch comprises 20% high quality, 50% average and 30% poor quality
Aside from fish, a number of fishermen have put some of their efforts into seaweed cultivation
The harvested seaweed is sold to exporters in Manado
These fishermen obtain their capital from businessmen or exporters through a partnership system
One seaweed exporter said that he went into partnership with around 3,000 fishermen and produced 150 tons of dry seaweed a month
Seaweed is purchased from the fishermen at an average price of Rp4,250 per kg
Levies on Fish Auctions
All of the kabupaten visited by the SMERU team are implementing a system of levies, fixed at 5% of the value of each transaction
The levies are generally the responsibility of both the fishermen and the traders, each incurring a 2.5% charge
As not all the fish are sold in the fish auction area, the levies are usually borne by the traders or the exporters who pay the local treasury directly
In practice, the collection of levies has not been carried out strictly nor in accordance with the regulations, but have been based on some sort of agreement or price estimate
Local regulations presently in effect regarding the levies on fish auctions have never been introduced or explained properly to either the fishermen or the traders
Fishermen and traders in several parts of Bolaang Mongondow reported that they received information on the levies from local government officials who calculated the revenue
Nevertheless, the provision of a public auction space is one sign that the local government is making some attempt to help the local fishermen
Levies on Seaweed Enterprises
Similar to the situation of the fish traders, seaweed producers are obliged to pay various types of levies, these include
1
Maritime entrepreneurs are obliged to pay a 2.5% levy on the value of each transaction to the local government
2
Seaweed producers are required to pay for quality control certificates, at a cost of Rp100,000 per certificate
3
They must also pay Rp1.1 million for the obtaining of a business-trading license which is valid for five years
According to several fishermen, the local government is also intending to create a business license for fishermen and seaweed producers
Up until now these two groups have been considered as part of the large companies with whom they have a client relationship and who pay for and obtain the business licenses
Since the reforms were carried out, the organization of documents has become a lot smoother and transparent, and it appears that the collection of illegal levies no longer occurs
In the past there were third party contributions, however these were abolished several years ago
The main problem facing seaweed producers is a lack of security at the production site and along the highways
Other problems arise from local governments that are still regarded as authoritarian, so that decisions involving the fishing industry are unilaterally determined without any attempt to take account of seaweed producers or fishermen's opinions
The Perikani State Enterprise
The Perikani State Enterprise is active in the cold storage industry (primarily skipjack and flying fish) and supplies both the local canning industry and the export market primarily through Bangkok
At present, all of their supplies of fish are purchased from fishermen through middleman traders
The company has a total production capacity of 600 tons a day, but as present, as fish catches are down, the production rate is as little as 30 tons a day
Perikani has estimated that it only receives around 10% of North Sulawesi's total catch
There are quite a number of enterprises of this type operating out of North Sulawesi
Consequently prices are determined in a competitive environment
Recently, world fish prices have been on the increase again, for example, the present price of skipjack is around US $600 per ton, compared to a previous low of US $400 per ton
Fishing industry entrepreneurs have begun to notice the impact of regional autonomy with the emergence of plans to implement a range of new regulations
Fishing licenses have been imposed in every kabupaten and kota with access to the sea
If all of the planned local regulations were to be put into effect, those people in the fishing industry will be obliged to pay these levies and much of their time will be occupied with licensing and tariff procedures in every region where they operate
In turn, all of this will result in the emergence of a high cost economy
Mina Enterprises Ltd
This State Enterprise has been in operation in Gorontalo since February 1988
During this time, they have only been subject to a 2.5% local levy which they have not regarded as excessive
A major problem now facing Mina Enterprises Ltd concerns the changes that the central government intends to impose, where the company will be subject to a national income tax amounting to 10%
Mina Enterprises Ltd has a cold storage capacity of 200 tons
All of their fish supplies come from fishermen who are grouped under co-operatives
Presently, there are five such co-operatives in Gorontalo, resulting in quite a competitive environment
In certain seasons, when Bitung and Makassar experience a shortage of fish, buyers and traders from these ports can travel as far as Gorontalo to purchase fish, consequently increasing local competition
In connection with this competition, Mina Enterprises Ltd has proposed to the Office of Fisheries at the provincial level that government should tighten the requirements for companies wishing to start out in the industry (a kind of negative list or set of protection measures)
For example, if a new company is intending to start out in the industry, they should be allocated fishing grounds further offshore
Without such a regulation, the existing companies will have to compete for the limited available resources

Businesses in the Livestock Sector 
Kabupaten Gorontalo has four livestock markets that are managed by the Office for Markets
These markets are open for trade once a week alongside a weekly general retail market that sells all kinds of basic necessities
Traders and middlemen carry out all the transactions that take place in these livestock markets
At Pulubala's market in Kecamatan Tibawa, one of the livestock markets visited by the SMERU team, between 12 and 30 head of cattle were traded during a typical market day
Each cow sold at the market incurs a Rp10,000 tariff (in line with the Gorontalo Government's Local Regulation No.7, 1999) and must be accompanied by a ‘Livestock ownership certificate from the Pulubala Village'
This service is carried out by officials from the Office for Markets and the local village
As to who pays the levy, this depends on each agreement reached; however, generally it is the responsibility of the owner of livestock or the person who makes the sale
The funds from the levy are then divided up
5% to the official collecting the levies, 57% to the local government, and 38% to the village treasury
If livestock are transported out of the region, the trader is subject to a levy of Rp50,000 per head of cattle
Drivers of livestock carriers, report that all livestock incur such levies, even those that are intended for slaughter or trade outside of the region
For example, when they transport animals that have just been purchased by local farmers who intend to use them for breeding, they are still compelled to pay the Rp50,000 levy
These levies are rendered at inspection stations (involving officials from the Office of Animal Husbandry, the Local Treasury Office, the Office for Communications and Trade as well as the police) that are located on the boarders of Kabupaten Boalemo and Gorontalo
Officials argue that all livestock leaving Gorontalo are subject to the levy, while truck drivers contend that this is one of the flaws in the existing regulations
Usually however, a compromise is often reached with a payment of Rp40,000 for every three head of cattle

Businesses in the Forestry 
Sector Rattan
Gorontalo is Eastern Indonesia's primary rattan producer, with numerous rattan manufacturing and processing companies emerging in the area
Apart from the raw materials that come from Kabupaten Gorontalo, a large proportion also come from Kabupaten Bolmong
It has been recognized that Kabupaten Gorontalo does not enjoy the value-added benefits that could result from rattan production because the raw materials are all processed in Java
This has become a challenge for entrepreneurs in the rattan industry in Gorontalo
Entrepreneurs in the industry think that with the implementation of regional autonomy, the business climate will become uncertain
On the one hand, there are advantages to the provisioning of licenses, as management practices are simpler and easier
Yet on the other hand, taxes and levies are increasing as a result of the various forms and the numerous collection posts
It is not so much the actual cost of the levies that are making the entrepreneurs anxious, but the way in which the local government is imposing these regulations
The government did not carry out an effective information program but simply informed rattan producers of the levies in a letter backdated by four months (that is, they were informed in April 2001; however, the levies were calculated from January 2001)
Consequently, the entrepreneurs in the rattan industry were shocked and objected as they felt that they were not involved in the formulation of these local regulations
They even appeared before the Bupati to lodge a protest
The Bupati argued that ‘the region needs funding to develop, and therefore business people need play their part''
Levy Collection Stations
Agricultural produce levy stations, particularly those collecting levies on forest products, are already in operation
Throughout the whole of Kabupaten Gorontalo there are five levy collection stations which have been established in various locations
The levy collection officials plan to fine rattan carriers that exceed the regulatory weight limit
The size of the fine is yet to be determined, and will depend upon an agreement reached between the officials and the traders
however, that the officials will have more say in determining the amount to be levied
Other Problems Faced by the Rattan Industry Entrepreneurs
Other issues causing anxiety for those in the industry include the discriminatory treatment being handed out by the Kabupaten Gorontalo Government
There have been various new regulations and levies imposed on licensed businesses that now have to be obeyed
Meanwhile, numerous illegal businesses in the rattan industry have been left alone
The local government has not yet taken any action against those unauthorized entrepreneurs in the industry who are suspected to have the protection of ‘people of influence'
Essentially, the entrepreneurs in the industry all agree that there needs to be a clear set of regulations which supports the sustainability of their businesses
For example, entrepreneurs certainly require an origin of goods certificate to indicate that their goods are really leaving a certain region and that the levies on these goods have already been paid
In this way, they hope that they will be exempt from paying levies elsewhere during transport
Entrepreneurs in the rattan industry admit that many of them do not fully understand regional autonomy, especially the differences between Provincial and kabupaten authority
For example, when one local entrepreneur filed a request for a forest management license with the local government at the kabupaten level, his request was rejected
This same entrepreneur then applied for the same license with the provincial government who subsequently granted his request
However, when he began business operations he was reprimanded by kabupaten government officials who prohibited him from operating in that region
This entrepreneur was confused because under the New Order Government things were never quite so complicated
5
Businesses in the Construction Sector 
Construction Enterprises and Regional Autonomy
The manager of Indonesia's Association of Construction Consultants (Gapensi) in Kabupaten Bolmong believes that the central government is not yet really committed to handing over authority to the regions
their movements are being restricted, particularly those working in the construction industry
They tend to complain about the difficulties in obtaining central government projects in the regions because the central government still allows any contractors including those from outside the region to compete
This free competition can kill the chances of local enterprises obtaining a project even if they win a small-scale project, their role remains marginal
The cause of the problem is the tough tender conditions imposed on central government projects, so that entrepreneurs from the regions are always eliminated
Some time ago, approximately 60 Gapensi members submitted applications for a certain project, but not one of them was successful
In reaction to this, Gapensi proposed that a local regulation be drafted to protect the rights of local contractors who wish to work on local projects, especially those funded by the Central Government Budget
It was hoped that there might be a division of labor between local contractors and those from outside the region so that there would be some sort of assurance of work for the local contractors
‘if possible, there should be regulations ensuring that local projects are only carried out by local contractors'
The manager of Gapensi in Kabupaten Minahasa also admits that entrepreneurs active in the construction field (that is members of Gapensi) are not yet ready for autonomy
This is indicated by the large number of business contractors who rely totally upon local government projects
Actually, it could be said that, the viability of their companies depends upon the local government
Up until now, Gapensi members have never worked on a project of their own, such as a housing complex construction project
They have never had the capacity to invest or draw on the potential of the region, particularly its natural resources and tourism
The obstacle is not only a lack of capital but also these companies are not yet able to rely on their own human resources
According to the certification records of all companies providing goods and services, who are members of the Provincial Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Kabupaten Minahasa, it would appear that only 30% have reasonable management systems
The Business Climate (Transparency and KKN)
Business people and entrepreneurs have begun to show concern about the local governments' tendency to raise revenues through the creation of new levies and taxes or by increasing existing charges
Gapensi and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, however, have yet to deal with this issue because many of the local regulations that have been approved have yet to be effectively implemented and their actual impact on entrepreneurs is not yet evident
Basically, both Gapensi and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry have no objections to levies involving the provision of licenses, provided that the money collected from these levies actually reaches the local treasury
Entrepreneurs, primarily contractors have never really made an issue out of levies and taxes
They have always found a way to move these items into the expense column when calculating their tender price
In this way, outlays to cover the payments of taxes and levies have never reduced their profit margin
Although in Kabupaten Gorontalo business people in the construction sector still pay third party contributions, the cost of these has substantially decreased when compared to the period before the emergence of the reform movement
In the year 2000, Gapensi's total third party contributions amounted to Rp300 million, but when many Gapensi members were previously busy their contributions amounted to Rp1.4 billion
Added to this, the semi-official cut from each project received by entrepreneurs now tends to be smaller, in line with the suggestion made by the Local Chamber of Commerce in Kabupaten Minahasa
This improved situation is a result of the development of a system whereby both the DPRD and the community are beginning to monitor the activities of local government
Previously, local government charges were unofficial and could amount to 10-12% of the total project value
current levies are set at only 7% of the project value
Corruption, collusion and nepotism in the public service system continues to occur
Some examples of this include
Information on the cost of obtaining a consultant's business license varies from one official to the next 
With a significant difference between the figures quoted
A businessman wanting to organize a license asked three different officials the price
The first official quoted him Rp700,000, the second Rp400,000, and the third Rp200,000
Business licenses still have to be organized at two levels of government, that is at the provincial and kabupaten and kota levels
This licensing procedure, aside from wasting a lot of time is generally accompanied by an unofficial fee
There are still numerous levy collection stations along transport routes that are frequently used by carriers of agricultural produce, primarily timber
Entrepreneurs are generally prepared to pay a single levy at one of these stations but they are not prepared to pay at every collection station

The Perceptions of the Non-business 
People Non Government Organizations (NGO) The Implementation of Regional Autonomy and Public Policy
Several NGOs informants believe that the implementation of Law No 22, 1999 on Regional Government constitutes a new era that it will lend to changes in several aspects of regional government administration
However, in carrying out this process of change there are still a number of strategic problems that must be overcome so that the goals of the policies can be met
Some of these problems that are relevant to the business climate include the following
1
The local government has made few steps towards conducting public information campaigns to explain the new policies
This has resulted in the community asking numerous questions about various public policies
The formulation of local regulations, especially in relation to levies, has resulted in many objections from those required to pay
It is often suggested that the local government only wants to collect the funds from the levies and is not concerned about paying any attention to the services or facilities required by the community
Complaints about signs of compulsion in the collection of levies led to petty-traders in one of the local markets holding a protest rejecting the collection of these levies
2
The mentality and attitudes of both executive and legislative officials has not yet changed very significantly from those that held sway under the New Order
This is evident with the continuation of KKN practices
This matter constitutes one of the weak points of the implementation of regional autonomy in North Sulawesi
The power and performance of the Local Assemblies
As a result of Law 22, 1999, the local assemblies have been given a large amount of power
In fact sometimes it appears as if they are superior to the local executive
It is possible that this delegation of authority could become the foundation for a democratic and transparent process for the implementation of government administration in the regions
However, it appears that the local assemblies have not yet used the powers that they have gained to achieve the goals
Local NGO activist's have made the following observations about some of these issues
1
Local assemblies still use much of their authority to obtain money for the personal interests of their members
There is presently a rumor in one kabupaten that before the assembly is prepared to begin work on draft legislation, the local government is obliged to issue money to the assembly members
Members also intervene in the project tendering process as several of them are still contractors
2
The Perception of the Local Press The local press helps the community to follow and oversee the implementation of regional autonomy by providing a sufficient coverage of regional news
The following constitutes a few of these issues that are frequently reported quite critically by the local press
1
Assessments of the provincial, kabupaten and kota governments suggest they are yet to come up with a sound strategy for the implementation of their authority gained under autonomy
Also they are yet to develop a clear approach on how to raise service standards and develop the business climate in the region
2
The provincial, kabupaten and kota governments have a tendency to interpret local autonomy as the legitimization of their efforts to increase local revenue
For example, all local government offices are currently being pressured to work on collecting local revenue within the area of authority of the particular agency concerned, despite the fact that not all government offices have the potential for this
In connection with this, local government should focus their efforts on creating the conditions conducive to investment
Only if there is investment will there be any chance to improve the people's welfare and increase regional revenue
The Perception of Academics Several weaknesses, even flaws in the implementation of Regional Autonomy can be identified
Some of the most prominent include
1
The kabupaten and kota governments are still interpreting Law No 22, 1999 and Law No 25, 1999 inaccurately
This is evident in the local government's enthusiasm for increasing local revenue; however there is little evidence of such enthusiasm for improving the quality of public services
2
Local governments do not have the courage to reduce the total number of civil servants that they employ
In fact, taken on extra officials from outside the bureaucracy despite the fact that there are limited key positions and funding is insufficient
In turn, local governments have made efforts to increase its income with the implementation of all kinds of taxes and levies on almost all of the community's economic activities
3
Basically, the community desires powerful local assemblies, but if these institutions cannot ensure the high quality and moral standards of their members, their position of power may in fact become a hindrance on the wider community
So far they have been too easily able to approve various pieces of draft legislation on taxes and levies without any consideration of the effects on the regions' economic activities
The Perception of Village Co-operatives Village co-operatives believe that local government information programs about their policies have been insufficient
In one region, for example, officials from the Local Treasury Office suddenly started collecting a 10% restaurant tax on the turnover of roadside coffee stalls owned by village co-operatives
This tax on turnover really did not make sense because with total sales turnover averages about Rp6 million per month, the tax that need to be paid is Rp600,000
In contrary, such stalls only make a monthly profit of around Rp250,000
This system of taxation is just another way of throttling small-scale community economic activities
If the village co-operatives operating these coffee stalls are both forced to pay such a tax, they would have to raise their prices by 10%
The results can be easily imagined - customers would soon start to frequent other coffee stalls which don't have to pay such a tax
IV
THE TRENDS IN THE IMPACT OF REGULATIONS 1
The Impact of Levies The following chapter aims to analyze several trends that may result from the implementation of local government policies (see Chapter II) as well as the reactions and perceptions of business people, NGOs, the press and academics (see Chapter III) to the regulations
Excessive levies on many of the community's economic activities is likely to lead to inefficiencies in the system and a high cost economy
Of the three kabupaten visited, Kabupaten Gorontalo had devised the highest number of local regulations and pieces of draft legislation involving taxes and levies
During 2001, the Kabupaten Gorontalo government aimed to create 75 such local regulations
Similarly, the Kabupaten Minahasa government identified as many as 89 possible ways to collect local revenue
While, the Kabupaten Bolaang Mongondow government has prepared approximately 23 new pieces of draft legislation containing taxes and levies
The farming sector constitutes the primary support and means of livelihood for most individuals living in these kabupaten
However, for the local government, this sector is potentially an important source of revenue
Although the taxes and levies are applied directly on the traders in agricultural produce, the farmers will also feel the impact indirectly
Traders admit that they will funnel a portion of these levies off on to the farmers by reducing the prices that they pay to farmers for their produce
The impact these regulations have had on the business climate is also starting to become apparent
Indications of this are evident in the number of levies collected from drivers as well as entrepreneurs along the transport routes (see Box 2)
Entrepreneurs have started to worry that when all the local regulations come into effect, the price of goods will increase at the consumer level
This means that whenever community purchasing power is low, there will be a resulting drop in the volume of sales of goods
Levies have already resulted in inefficiencies in the distribution system between regions, and also have the potential to create a high cost economy in the near future
The main considerations for the creation of local regulations focus on means to seek out local sources of revenue, while efforts to increase the standard and quality of services for the public tend to be ignored
Based on the power and authority they have been given, every local government technical office has been urged to think carefully and come up with ways to locate sources of local revenue
In fact, one kabupaten has directly linked the success of its government offices at locating local sources of revenue and the size of the budget that will be allocated to each of them
Local regulations include mention of the authority to increase services for the community, this seems to be little more than a formality
It is clear that local governments have yet to formulate mature plans to indicate how they will provide services and facilities for the community in order to justify their collection of levies
It is quite possible that the collection of levies will be strongly enforced
It is apparent that local governments are only concerned about collecting the funding from the levies, without paying any serious attention to the quality of services
As a result of the large number of levies created, the local governments have been inconsistent in their efforts to increase investment in the regions
To achieve this, local government has began to think about various ways to make the investment process easier, as well as the facilities that are required to ensure that investors remain interested enough to invest their capital
However, in reality, the local government is also eager to formulate policies on taxes and levies that will increase local revenue even though this tends to create a business climate that are neither healthy nor competitive
The blurred relationship between the kabupaten, kota and provincial governments opens the possibility of duplication and overlapping levies being applied to the same goods and services
Under regional autonomy, the kabupaten and kota governments hold more power and authority than the provinces
The hierarchical relationship between those two levels of government has been fractured
There is a continuing need for coordination between the kabupaten and kota governments and the provincial governments in many strategic fields
However, up until now such links have not yet been formed
Based on their authority, the kabupaten local government has created regulations about the organizational structure of their administration as well as those concerning taxes and levies in order to collect local revenue
As well as this, the provincial government, which still considers that it retains certain authority, has carried out similar reforms, including taxes and levies for revenue purposes
As a result of this, there is a strong possibility that levies will overlap between the two layers of government
This problem has already become a worry for several groups within the community, primarily local business people
The following two examples illustrate some of the possible outcomes
Levies at the provincial level in the fisheries sector are covered by Regulations No 1 and No 5, 2000 (Retail and Wholesale Markets), and Regulation No 13, 2000 (Fishing Enterprises in the Province of North Sulawesi)
It would appear that the provincial government's policies relating to the fisheries sector are in conflict with those of the kabupaten governments
The kabupaten and kota governments will also take similar measures, and demand the power and authority that has actually become their right be relinquished
For example, this will include their control over seaports and public fish auctioning facilities within their region
The content of Local Regulation No 5, 2000 is quite interesting and should receive closer attention
Presently, the provincial government interprets retail and wholesale markets to mean areas owned, constructed and controlled by North Sulawesi's provincial government specifically for the purpose of conducting fish auctions or wholesale business
Levies are fixed at 5% of each transaction and are paid by both the buyers and the fishermen, the former paying 3%, and the latter 2%
This regulation also stipulates how the funds collected from these levies will be allocated
that is, 3% to the local government, 1% for market operational costs, and the final 1% for the auction costs
The local governments' share of the revenue is then divided between the provincial government (80%) and the kabupaten and kota governments (20%)
However it must be remembered that the kabupaten and kota governments have authority over these areas and have also targeted them for the collection of revenue
This means that they have already devised certain local regulations similar to the provincial government's regulations, and will continue to do so
Even when this occurs, it is only for the sake of formality
The local government had no intention of embracing and listening to the opinions of the community
According to one bupati, business people must make a contribution to the region, because the region needs a significant amount of capital to implement autonomy
Furthermore, when draft legislation is being discussed at the legislative branch of local government, those who are to be subject to the levies have not been given the chance to make any amendments or voice their ideas
Assembly members have tended to agree with all the concepts filed by the executive, because it is very much in their interests to increase local revenue
Levies in the forestry and mining sectors are based on short-term profit making policies and are a potential threat to the preservation of natural resources
The regions have yet to formulate and implement a policy on forest and mining management that includes sustainable resource development, because human resources remain low
For the time being, local government is still pre-occupied with ways in which to obtain local revenue from these two sectors
However, in the long term this has the potential to threaten the preservation of resources
2
Regional Autonomy which has Negative Implications on the Business Climate 
Policies created by the kabupaten, kota and provincial governments still focus on methods to procure local revenue, and are yet to pay serious attention to regulations and interventions affecting the distribution system or market commodities in the regions
There is still a push to make policies effective as regulations
Evidence of this comes from the decree issued by the Governor of North Sulawesi, which regulates pharmaceutical enterprises, as analyzed in Chapter II
The protectionist and interventionist nature of the decrees issued often appear to be the result of pressure from local entrepreneurs who want their privileged positions in the market place be protected
During the era of autonomy, it is possible for the local governments to pass regulations to fulfill the demands of business interests in the region
Entrepreneurs originating from the region, known as ‘sons of the region' (putra daerah) have become a threat to various other groups, as they are regarded as an element that can lead to discriminative and biased local government policies
There is a strong possibility that a policy favoring putra daerah could be created in the future
The following cases represent a few of those from North Sulawesi recorded by the SMERU team, regarding proposals and demands of farmers and local entrepreneurs to local government for special treatment and protection
(1) Gapensi in Kabupaten Bolmong complained because their members are often unsuccessful in obtaining central government projects in the regions
These projects are always carried out by entrepreneurs from outside the region and without the involvement of local entrepreneurs
As a result, Gapensi has proposed to the local government that they should produce a special policy, to assist Gapensi members
The intended policy constitutes a regulation giving local entrepreneurs priority in carrying out all central and regional government projects in the area
(2) Usaha Mina, a tuna cold storage and export company has urged the local government in Kabupaten Minahasa to limit the amount (arrange a type of negative list) of cold storage companies intending to start out in the industry
It is feared that if the number of cold storage companies were to increase, pre-existing companies would be slowly pushed to one side
(3) For the last few months, the price of copra and coconuts has continued to fall, driving coconut farmers in North Sulawesi grouped under Apeksu to file 10 demands to the Provincial government (see Box 1, Chapter II)
One of these demands was for the local government to form a team to control and determine the price of coconuts and copra in North Sulawesi so that prices will increase and then be maintained at a more satisfactory level
The local government accommodated this demand when the Governor of North Sulawesi issued Decree No 27, 2001 on the 22nd, March 2001
The essence of some of their other demands included their desire for some sort of protection, hoping that the North Sulawesi community would stop consuming palm oil
the buying and selling of copra in North Sulawesi should be carried out through an auction coordinated by Apeksu
(4) One trader has made an effort to dominate the inter-island livestock trade from Gorontalo by taking charge of the seaport
He achieved this by strategically positioning his boats at the port for weeks on end before the loading had began
As a result of this, other traders' boats that were waiting to transport livestock experienced delays, and in the end were forced to cancel their programs
Reportedly, this livestock trader is a prominent figure in the Kabupaten Gorontalo government, and escaped any reprimand
V
CONCLUSION 
Both the implementation of regional autonomy and a policy of decentralization in North Sulawesi have tended to blur the relationship between the various levels of government
When making decisions, the particular local government no longer has to make an effort to consult higher levels of government or their neighboring governments
the higher levels of government tend not to make an effort to consult or take into consideration the interests of the government below them
As a result, several of the decisions ratified by local government, including some in the economic sector, appear to have neglected either regional or national interests
In general, the sense of national awareness of a unitary state has not been reflected in the implementation processes of government administration in the regions
Presently, local government officials' activities, both at the provincial level as well as the kabupaten and kota levels, are primarily focussed on various ways to increase local revenue
The total number of levies that are already effective or will shortly become effective in the region has tended to increase, thus raising the possibility that the situation could revert to the way things were before Law No 18, 1997 on Regional Taxes and Levies was put into effect
There has been considerable competition between the provinces and the kabupaten and kota governments in regard to several of the goods that are now the subject of levies, as they have a high potential for raising large amounts of revenue
If this trend were to continue, a high cost economy would be difficult to avoid
Local business interests have played a large role in influencing local government thinking in regard to the creation of policies to regulate the market
Local entrepreneurs are not prepared to compete for contracts, as they feel they have special rights within the region leading to their demands that they (putra/pengusaha daerah) should be accorded priority and protection
Local governments have also thought hard about ways to attract investors in the North Sulawesi area
However, it would seem that these endeavors are often in opposition to the attempts to increase local revenue, and the demands to regulate the market will certainly curb investment interest in North Sulawesi
All of this is in direct opposition to the plan recently agreed upon by the central government, for Indonesia to open itself up to free trade amongst Southeast Asian nations beginning in 2002
INTRODUCTION 1
Background 
Under the previous New Order centralized administration, “local people” were often just treated as the implementers of the policies, decisions, as well as technical and implementation guidelines designed by the central government
At times the local governments have felt underestimated by the central government, which has compelled the regions to demand autonomous authority with increasing fervor
One clear way the local governments can achieve this autonomy is through the management of local revenue (Pendapatan Asli Daerah – PAD)
As a result, the local governments have issued various local regulations (peraturan daerah – perda) on taxes, levies and other charges
By 1996, there were nearly 200 types
In addition, the local governments also released various policies on business activities, especially through trade and market regulations
These policies include the allocation of zones for the sale of tea in West Java, the citrus fruit trading monopoly in West Kalimantan, the marketing of local produce through Village Cooperatives (Kooperasi Unit Desa - KUD) in East Nusa Tenggara, and the prohibition on the export of raw cashew nuts from South Sulawesi
Similar policies have also been put in place by the central government
These include the establishment of a clove monopoly by the Clove Marketing Board (Badan Penyangga dan Pemasaran Cengkeh – BPPC), inter-island livestock trade quotas, a national vehicle assembly by the public company PT Timor, and the import of the nine basic commodities by the State Logistics Agency (Badan Urusan Logisitik Nasional – BULOG)
The official aim of these local regulations and policies for the business sector was the protection of small farmers and producers
However in practice, many of these local regulations and policies have been aimed at raising local revenue and to either intentionally or unintentionally protect the interests of certain groups
This eventually created a “high cost economy” that distorted the business environment, weakened competitiveness, and impeded regional investment and economic development
Furthermore, these policies then attracted extensive criticism from both national and international quarters
As a result, the central government attempted to rectify this situation by issuing the tax reform Law No
18, 1997, which limited the kinds of taxes and levies which may be collected in the regions
As a result of the monetary crisis that occurred in mid 1997, the Government of Indonesia signed a Letter of Intent (LoI) with the IMF on the 15 January 1998
This promoted a program of deregulation through the correction of all central and regional government policies that had previously distorted the economy, including the abolition of inter-regional trade restrictions
The economic crisis that followed the monetary crisis forced the central and regional governments to make every effort to implement both of the above measures
Various levies were abolished and those policies that had a negative impact on the market were abandoned
Both of these changes to government policies had a positive effect on the business climate, as well as improving farmers' incomes
On the other hand, local governments subsequently viewed these policy changes as reducing their available sources of income
These demands have been further strengthened by the existence of new policies on decentralization and regional autonomy as outlined in Law No.22, 1999 on Regional Government and Law No
provides wider opportunities for the regions to issue local regulations concerning taxes and levies, while (in theory) still setting certain limits through the application of various strict conditions
The policy of decentralization and regional autonomy is intended to bring the government closer to the people so that government services can be delivered more effectively and efficiently
Consequently, local governments must prove that they are capable of implementing these polices in such a manner that brings significant benefits to the community
To achieve this, decentralization policies and regional autonomy should not only be in the form of delegated authority from the center to the regions
The local governments must also eventually hand over some of their newly gained authority to the local community
At present, the principle that is supposed to underlie decentralization policies and regional autonomy is community development, as this will empower the people in such a way that they are ready to be actively included in the democratic process, rather than only passive participants
However, in practice, this can only be achieved by open, responsible and fair governments
In other words, it is impossible for these policies to be implemented by local governments adhering to centralized and authoritarian practices
As far as economic activities are concerned, local governments need to promote their region in order to attract investment and stimulate trade
However, there is no guarantee that local governments will make such an effort, since during the New Order period of centralized government, local government officials tended to wait for directives from the central government with little opportunity to exercise their own authority
These practices have trapped local government officials in a system of practical and pragmatic activities
there is little room for regional government initiative and innovation
Consequently, now that the regions have gained greater authority, there is concern that they will imitate the models and practices established by the central government
Many observers are concerned that local governments will become absorbed in efforts to increase local revenue through various taxes and levies, eventually resulting in a high cost economy
There is also concern about the possibility of local governments releasing policies that discriminate against individuals from outside the region for the sake of the local community and its inhabitants (the putra daerah issue)
This situation is a cause of real concern because it threatens national unity both politically and economically
For example, if the policy of free trade between regions is no longer effective, then Indonesia's existence as a single unified market entity will be threatened
The notion of Indonesia as a “single unified market” is one of the binding elements of the unitary state of the Republic of Indonesia
As part of our research into the initial phase of the implementation of decentralization and regional autonomy under Law No
22, 1999 and Law No
25, 1999, the SMERU team has carried out several field studies to specifically obtain information on the following issues
1
Local government policy concerning the implementation of wider local authority,
Those policies related to local taxes, levies and other charges (both formal and informal)
Other policies relevant to the business climate, such as licensing and the regulation of local trade and markets
Furthermore, the extent to which the process of formulating formal regulations takes into account the views and interests of various community groups

The views of local government regarding the size of the General Allocation of Funds (Dana Alokasi Umum, DAU) from the central government, their strategies to increase local income through the available sources of local revenue (PAD) such as local taxes and levies, along with the policies and practicalities relating to the allocation of funds
3
The views and opinions of various economic actors and other interest groups within society on the impact of local government policy on the business climate together with its implications for trade and investment, especially on the movement of goods and services
This report is based on the results of SMERU fieldwork in the Province of West Java carried out between 22 October and 1 November 2001
The SMERU team visited two kabupaten in West Java (Kabupaten Cirebon and Kabupaten Garut) and collected documentation in Kabupaten Ciamis associated with the business climate
The Province of West Java is one of nine provinces investigated by SMERU within the overall framework of this study
One of the primary considerations for selecting the nine provinces was their geographic representation, with areas being chosen from Eastern Indonesia, Java and Western Indonesia
Information was obtained from officials, including the Governor and the Bupati as well as their staff, the regional secretaries and their staff, the heads of various bureaus and sections within the regional secretariat (legal affairs, government administration, finance and economic affairs), and the Regional Development Planning Board (Bappeda)
In addition, the team also interviewed the leaders of various government offices at the province and kabupaten level
For additional information, the team also consulted the leadership of the local Peoples Representative Assembly (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah - DPRD) and the Statistics Indonesia office (Kantor Biro Pusat Statistik - BPS)
Also interviewed were officials from the Local Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kamar Dagang dan Industri Daerah - Kadinda), the Indonesian Furniture Makers' Association (Asosiasi Meubeler Indonesia - Asmindo), businessmen in various sectors, traders at various levels, transport drivers, farmers and fishermen, editors and journalists of local newspapers, NGO leaders, and the teaching staff of local institutes of higher education

Regional Overview Following the formation of the Provincial Government of Banten based on Law No
23, 2000 which includes four kabupaten and two kota, the Province of West Java at present covers 16 kabupaten and 6 kota
Currently, the geographical coverage of West Java is approximately 34,597 km², which is 80% of its size prior to the division of the region into two provinces which at the time was recorded as covering 2.3% (43,240 km²) of the total area of Indonesia
In 2000, the total recorded population of West Java was approximately 32 million people
According to this figure, West Java is the province with the second largest population in Indonesia after East Java
Throughout 1999, West Java underwent the process of dividing the administration of the region between these two provinces, resulting in a significant number of new desa and kelurahan being formed (see Table 1)
The Province of West Java is strategically located within close proximity of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta, which enjoys good communications and transportation services
However, apart from enjoying the same positive social and economic benefits as those living in Jakarta, this close proximity also means that West Java experiences the same negative impact of arising social and economic problems
Furthermore, apart from having the same supporting infrastructure and facilities as Jakarta, West Java is also renowned for its fertile agricultural land
Hence, West Java has been considered as the “national bread basket”
In 1999, the Province of West Java (including the Province of Banten) produced 21% of the total amount of rice produced nationally
However, according to the Human Development Index figures, in 1999 both of these provinces were still ranked 15th nationally, which is worse than their ranking in 1996
Consequently, while West Java has various strengths and is experiencing many benefits compared to other provinces, it is still fraught with the problems of poverty amongst its inhabitants
In the Province of West Java, the SMERU team visited three kabupaten
Kabupaten Cirebon, Kabupaten Garut, and Kabupaten Ciamis
However, the research conducted in Kabupaten Ciamis was not as in-depth as was conducted in the other two kabupaten
In Kabupaten Ciamis, the team only collected various documents (secondary data) related to local rules and regulations in effect as well as those which are soon to be implemented
Kabupaten Cirebon is located on the north coast of West Java, directly bordered by the Province of Central Java
A large proportion of the region is lowland terrain covering an area of approximately 990.4km²
In 1999, the population was recorded at approximately 1.9 million persons
At present, Kabupaten Cirebon is the kabupaten occupying the smallest geographical area in the province following Kabupaten Purwakarta
it is the most densely populated region in the province with approximately 1,874 people/km²
Meanwhile, Kabupaten Garut and Kabupaten Ciamis are located in the southern part of the province
Kabupaten Tasikmalaya separates the two regions
A large proportion of these two regions is hilly highland terrain, including several mountains
In the south, the inclines are quite steep and are directly bordered by beautiful beaches and the Indian Ocean
The population density in Kabupaten Garut is higher than Kabupaten Ciamis, but both are classified as average, despite being below the average population density figures for the province
Based on the main types of work available, a large number of people living in West Java are employed (in consecutive order) as farmers, farmhands, traders, and manual laborers
As such, in Kabupaten Garut and Ciamis a large proportion of the population are working in the agricultural sector, while in Kabupaten Cirebon more people are employed as manual laborers in the industrial sector rather than as farmers, or farmhands
In Kabupaten Cirebon, several types of large, medium and small-scale industries have developed, including the rattan, batik and snack food industries, all employing a large number of manual laborers
There is also a seaport in Kabupaten Cirebon which provides employment for a large number of workers
The potential of the agricultural sector in Kabupaten Garut seems to be greater if compared with other kabupaten in West Java
Apart from producing rice, this kabupaten also is the primary producer of various types of secondary crops such as corn, cassava, soybeans, peanuts, and different types of vegetables
In addition, Kabupaten Garut also produces plantation products (tree crop and estate crop products), such as rubber, tea, akar wangi, and tobacco, as well as having the largest forest acreage in all of West Java
The leather handicrafts and snack food industries have also flourished in Kabupaten Garut
Meanwhile, the potential of the agricultural sector in Kabupaten Ciamis is also visible, especially as the largest coconut producer in all of West Java

The Implementation of Regional Autonomy This section is intended to provide a brief account of the steps taken by local governments in this region to implement decentralization and regional autonomy
These measures will either directly or indirectly affect the business climate in the region
Regional autonomy
a process or an “immediate outcome”
The business environment tends to be viewed in terms of current conditions, whereas regional autonomy constitutes a long-term multi-dimensional process
In the field, this issue often manifests debates, even conflict between various quarters, for example between the business community and the central government, or between the provincial government and the kabupaten or kota governments
For example, one case involved an International Monetary Fund request which was addressed through a Letter of Intent (LoI) in which the central government promised it would take firm action concerning approximately 100 local regulations considered to be problematic
The IMF request that at the very latest, these regulations should be abolished by June 2002
The Province of West Java views regional autonomy as a process which can be used to develop a model, referred to as systematic targeting, which covers the following stages
1
Initiating or making early preparations for regional autonomy
This was carried out until the end of 2001, and included identifying emerging problems and possible steps for the resolution of these problems, for example in terms of the conflict between the centre and the regions, between regions, and between community groups
2
Implementing regional autonomy throughout 2002 and 2003, covering efforts to monitor all pioneered activities
3
Consolidating regional autonomy between 2004 and 2006 in order to synchronize the various agendas of regional autonomy, including economic development and other political agendas, for example the processes for carrying out the general election
4
Stabilizing regional autonomy beginning 2007, which flows on from the previous stages and is directly related to the various changes which have occurred
If the main considerations for each of the stages above are given the necessary attention and are actually implemented, then there should not be any fundamental differences between regional autonomy as a process and regional autonomy as an “immediate outcome”
The providers of public services need courage to take the initiative, as well as to be innovative and creative in order to generate the required conditions to implement regional autonomy properly, stage by stage with patience and planning
The relationship between the different levels of government
Since the new policy on regional autonomy came into effect, there has been an evident lack of clarity regarding the relationships between the various levels of government, especially between the provinces and the kabupaten and kota
This is partly due to the content of Article 4, Clause 2 of Law No
22, 1999, which states that each autonomous region (province, kabupaten or kota) “stands alone and does not have a hierarchical relationship with any other (level of government)”
In fact, the formulation of the authority of each level of government remains unclear
As a result, the following key issues have emerged
there has been a loss of power amongst the provincial governments, especially in the eyes of government officials at the kabupaten and kota level; there has been a loss of coordination in the creation of new local regulations; and, it has become difficult to implement the transfer of personnel because the provincial government does not have any of its own offices in the kabupaten and kota governments
The system of local government, civil administration, and local government budgets
In order to improve the public service system in each local government agency, there is general agreement that a more streamlined system of local government is required to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness
However, such good intentions may be defeated by the reality that many civil servants and officials need to be provided with formal employment and official duties
As a result, the newly formed local government administrations are larger in size than under the previous system, including the central and provincial levels of government which now have more limited government authority according to Law No 22, 1999 
In other words, when these service institutions were formed, both the central and regional governments did not fully consider their authority or capabilities
Meanwhile, when organizing the civil and official administrations, apart from the putra daerah issue, there is an excess of civil servants caused by the transfer in their status from central government civil servants to regional government civil servants
The Province of West Java has taken on 5,459 officials from the central government, which is a 45% increase if compared to the previous number of staff employed
Consequently, there has been a significant increase in the amount allocated for routine expenses
In the 2001 budget year, the budget for routine expenses (69.5%) was higher than the development budget (30.5%) in the Province of West Java
What's more, for many years prior to the implementation of regional autonomy the development budget had always been higher than the amount allocated for routine expenses
A more direct result at present is the increasing levels of hidden unemployment occurring amongst civil servants, especially at the provincial level
Meanwhile, the kabupaten and kota governments have tended to refuse to accept transfers of civil servants from the provincial government
the General Allocation of Funds (Dana Alokasi Umum – DAU) for the regions amounts to 25% of state revenue, while the remaining 75% is retained by the central government
The local governments hope that a proportion of this 75% will flow on to the regions
In order to prepare to benefit from these funds, the West Java Government Secretary has established the Staff Transfer and Activities Monitoring Bureau
In addition, efforts to correctly calculate the budget for routine expenses in the regions have been impeded by two issues
Firstly, as yet there is no Minimum Service Standard (Standar Pelayanan Minimal – SPM) which can be used as a base for calculating the costs of providing government services
Secondly, the central government has not yet been fully transparent regarding state revenue
Public policy and Community Views and Opinions
There are different tendencies and a lack of coordination between regions in regards to the local regulations concerning public services, particularly in regards to licensing
Many people at the provincial level are concerned that this will have a negative impact on the business climate
For example, the license to establish factories which is issued by the Bandung kota government does not follow the procedures for waste disposal, and hence has had a negative impact on the Kabupaten Sumedang community
Several respondents (non-government officials) are concerned that the recent decline in the implementation of public services is the result of ineffective and weak supervision by the local assemblies
At present, for example, members of the local assemblies are becoming more inclined to get involved in processes for project tender and the implementation of local government projects
This has led to opportunities to “embellish” corruption, collusion and nepotism (Korupsi, Kolusi dan Nepotisme – KKN) between the bureaucrats and members of the legislature
“If the accountability report (laporan pertanggungjawaban – LPJ) provided by the local government (Governor and Bupati) is to be accepted, then members of the local assemblies require the opportunity to enjoy local government projects”
II
LOCAL REGULATIONS 
It is important that the regions are capable of driving regional economic development towards efficiency during the implementation of decentralization and regional autonomy
This can be achieved through both reviewing and not repeating the mistakes of the previous centralized New Order Administration which tended to intervene in the market mechanism to meet the interests of particular groups
Regional autonomy has created the opportunity to develop the potential of each region so that a positive competitive environment is created between regions by maximizing economic opportunities
Competition will enable the regions to develop a business environment which is conducive to investment
In order to do this, the regional government offices are required to have wider and more long-term perspectives which includes formulating local policies which aim to improve and sustain community prosperity rather than being merely focussed on short-term objectives
However, the reality in the field demonstrates the regions' narrow interpretation of the implementation of decentralization and regional autonomy
The regions tend to use their present authority to seek out sources of local revenue by imposing various local taxes and levies
The SMERU team found that in the Provinces of North Sumatra, North Sulawesi, and Gorantalo the size of the General Allocation of Funds provided by the central government did not influence local government efforts to seek out sources of local revenue
In addition to the regulations governing changes to the system of local government administration, a large number of the local regulations already issued are concerned with increasing local revenue
The SMERU team observed several ambiguous local government regulations in the field
On the one hand, these local regulations are viewed as the logical consequence of regional autonomy, because the regions require a new legal basis to carry out their autonomous rights
However, on the other hand, these local regulations have been proposed in order to increase the level of income for each region
This can be viewed as the negative consequences of misinterpreting the legislation when implementing regional autonomy
Local government officials are under the impression that the local governments have to cover the costs incurred in their own regions themselves
Yet others are aware that if the authority provided for the regions was only related to the capabilities of the regions to increase local revenue, then regional autonomy will never materialize as intended
It is possible that the various regulations related to these taxes and levies will become obstacles which distort market mechanisms, burden the business sector, and make conducting business more difficult
Representatives from the IMF and the business sector make up the bulk of the members of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and are concerned about this possibility
Considering the situation at present, the government has recommended that the Ministry of Home Affairs revoke 71 local regulations which are already effective in several provinces, kabupaten and kota, through the Department of Finance which issued Minister of Finance Decision Letter No
S-486/MK.07/2001, 2 November 2001 regarding the “Minister of Finance's Evaluation of Local Regulations on Taxes and Levies”
1
The Provincial Level of Government In terms of the size of local revenue as a proportion of the local budget, the Province of West Java is considered to have adequate financial means
For the 1999/2000 budget year, local revenue amounted to 31%
In the 2000 budget year local revenue constituted 48.1% of the provincial budget
This local revenue is mainly derived from local taxes (94%)
The contribution of local revenue to the 2001 budget is estimated to have reached 49.3% (Rp1.1 trillion), with 90% being derived from local taxes
Meanwhile, in 2001 the General Allocation of Funds received by the West Java Provincial Government amounted to Rp521.2 billion, and contingency funds amounted to Rp31.1 billion
Both of these sources of funding only contributed 24.4%
Thus, funds from local revenue greatly outweighed the funds provided for the 2001 West Java provincial government budget from the General Allocation of Funds and contingency funds
Furthermore, the allocation for routine expenses in the draft 2001 provincial budget amounted to 69.2% of the total funds, whereas the allocation for development amounted to 30.8%
General Allocation of Funds provided for the Province of West Java for the 2002 budget year would be reduced to Rp377 billion
This is attributed to the fiscal gap noted between the regions, as well as the quite large amount of local revenue
The provincial government is opposed to this policy which includes the amount of local revenue obtained previously in the formula for calculating future central government funding because it reduces the incentive for the regions to be creative in seeking new sources of revenue
However, irrespective of this issue, the West Java provincial government has already either seriously considered or began planning various endeavors to develop sources of income for increasing local revenue, for example
1) While still at the level of discussion, the provincial government desires stateowned enterprises (Badan Usaha Milik Negara – BUMN) make direct contributions to the region
State-owned enterprises are potential sources of local revenue because to date, they have had the benefit of using the local government's assets without the burden of any taxes or levies
2) The provincial government wants to have a direct role in the construction of toll roads
In order to do this, there must be local enterprises capable of handling the activities associated with the construction
Consequently, one of the draft regulations currently being discussed by the local parliament is concerned with the “Establishment of Limited Companies providing Goods and Services in West Java”
3) The provincial government has already developed several local enterprises (such as the West Java Bank, Local Agribusiness Enterprises, Local Industry Enterprises, and Local Tourism Enterprises)
4) One initiative undertaken by the provincial government has been to make efforts to ensure that the management of Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax is directly handled by the local government
5) The Provincial Government Office of Fisheries is planning to create local regulations on various policies concerning public services which are considered to extend across the authority of more than one kabupaten and/or kota government, for example
Licensing in the fisheries sub-sector, with reference to Government Regulation No.141, 2001
This regulation stipulates that fish catch licenses for boats measuring less than 10 gross tons are within the authority of the kabupaten and kota governments, but the provincial government has licensing authority for boats measuring 10-30 gross tons
The certification of the quality of fingerlings to protect the cultivation of fish in Cirata Dam, and regulations providing guidance and supervision for fish hatchery farmers' groups producing fingerlings which are specific to the region, for example gurame fingerlings from Ciamis, as well as carp and nila fish from Majalaya
This certification process should become effective in 2002
Accordingly, there is already a registration process in place for training hatchery supervisors (one of the functional positions in the region)
The formation of a Fish Quarantine Centre in Cengkareng
In relation to this, the West Java Provincial Office of Fisheries will issue certificates ensuring the quality of the fishery produce (Surat Keterangan Kesehatan Ikan) for export
6) In the transport and communications sector, the provincial government has considered imposing several forms of licenses and charges, for example, the proposed levies on quality inspections for businesses assembling motor vehicle bodies (karoseri) are determined as follows
Rp50,000 for vehicles weighing less than 5 tons; 
Rp.75,000 for vehicles weighing between 5-10 tons; and 
Rp100,000 for vehicles weighing greater than 10 tons
The provincial government estimates that 10,000 vehicles are inspected each year, creating a target revenue of between Rp500-Rp800 million per year
The provincial government must clarify their authority over city transport which crosses over the boundaries of more than one kabupaten and/or kota in the province
To date, the limits to authority remain unclear, making it difficult to stipulate which authority is the joint responsibility of more than one province and which is the full responsibility of the province
At present, weigh bridges are being renovated in order to optimize usage and increase their capacity
Staff at the Office of Transport and Communications are aware that there are still many problems to be overcome regarding weigh bridges because in reality, a large proportion of vehicles carry a load which exceeds their capacity
Based on the budgeted components of local revenue in the West Java Provincial Government Budget for 2001, in principle, as yet no basic changes have been made concerning efforts to seek out new sources of local revenue
Table 2 demonstrates the types of taxes and levies effectively being charged at present
Meanwhile, the provincial government continues to defend its authority over some of its sources of local revenue
This includes maintaining their authority over the Motor Vehicle Road Worthiness Levy (Retribusi Pengujian Kendaraan Bermotor) which now falls within the authority of the kabupaten and kota government according to Government Regulation No 25, 2000
Consequently, Provincial Government Regulation No 6, 1999 which regulates these levies, was revoked through Provincial Government Regulation No 15, 2001
However, the provincial government still determines this revenue target because the inspection materials such as the inspection books, aluminium, certification stamps, and other equipment are owned by the provincial government and the staff who conduct the inspections all have provincial government status
This indicates that there is a large incentive for the provincial government to defend its source of income, rather than passing the authority on to the kabupaten and kota governments as required
Representatives from the Provincial Government Office of Transport and Communications, one of the bodies which carries out these inspections have actually stated that they will pass the equipment on to the kabupaten and kota
This situation is one example of disputes between the provincial and kabupaten and kota governments over authority
Other issues include managing the provision of services such as clean water and waste disposal
Provincial Government Regulation No.9, 2000 on the “Retail and Wholesale Distribution Levy” basically only regulates levies imposed on public fish markets because apart from fish products, there are no other commodities which are sold through public auctions
This regulation stipulates in detail the exact amount of the levy as well as the allocation of the income derived from the levy
The levy is charged at 5% of the value of the transaction, with 3% paid by the purchaser and 2% paid by the supplier (fishermen)
The income from this levy is allocated as follows
1) Both levels of government receive a total allocation of 1.6% of the revenue, that is each local government receives 0.8%
2) The operational costs and the maintenance of the wholesale markets are covered by 0.8% of the revenue received and are allocated as
Guidance and supervision funds (0.35%); Local development funds for fisheries (0.30%); and Operational funds for the Centre for Village Fishing Cooperative (KUD Mina) (0.15%)
3) The remaining 2.6% has been allocated for public fish auctions as follows
Implementation and administration of public fish auctions (1.65%); Savings for the Fisherman's Village Cooperatives (0.35%); Drought funds (0.25%); Social funds for fishing accidents (0.25%); and Security funds (0.10%)
The provincial government wants this regulation to become a point of reference for both managing and effectively charging levies on public fish auctions for all kabupaten and kota in West Java which have potentially viable ocean fishing industries
However, in reality several kabupaten want to draft their own regulations
For the 2001 budget year, revenue from the public fish auctions levy was estimated at Rp1.1 billion, after deducting the allocation for public fish auctions
Apart from the management of public fish auction locations, other services handled by the provincial Office of Fisheries include issuing certificates of quality assurance for export commodities
However, this service has not yet been fully implemented because the Technical Service Unit Laboratories are still managed directly by the central government and have not yet officially been transferred to the provincial government
For the 2000 budget year the provincial government has already ratified two provincial regulations stipulating government charges in the plantations sector
1) Provincial Regulation No.23, 2000 on “Tree Felling in Large Plantations in West Java”; and 
2) Provincial Regulation No.24, 2000 on “Tea Processing Enterprises”
The two types of charges outlined in these regulations have not yet been effectively imposed because they were not detailed as potential income components in the 2001 provincial budget
These regulations were created because the provincial government has authority over those areas effecting the arrangements and interests of more than one kabupaten and/or kota
In the first stage of their implementation, conflict occurred between the kabupaten and kota and provincial governments concerning these regulations
The Cianjur and Tasikmalaya Kabupaten governments, for example, have both created kabupaten regulations with similar contents to the provincial regulations
They believe that the kabupaten government has control over the region, not the provincial government
Table 3 below contains a list of the contents and reasons put forward for revoking these two kabupaten regulations
Following this, in 2001 the provincial government ratified Provincial Government Regulation No.6, 2001 on “The Use and Extraction of Ground Water and Surface Water Tax” which as yet has not been implemented effectively
Both the regulatory authority and the authority to collect this tax has been returned to the provincial government as stipulated in Law No.34, 2000
Previously, the kabupaten and kota governments had authority over this tax based on Law No.18, 1997
When creating local regulations, the West Java Provincial Government has differentiated between regulations which contain directives and those which govern charges, even though it is the same object being regulated
For example, apart from provincial government regulations on retail and wholesale distribution which stipulates the system used for imposing charges as well as the size of the charges on fish auctions, there are also separate special regulations on the management and implementation of fish auctions
The extraction and use of both surface and ground water is also regulated in the same manner
Several local regulations containing general directives and their key characteristics are outlined below (not including local regulations on charges reviewed previously)
1) Provincial Government Regulation No.8 2000 on “Conducting Fish Auctions” (amends Provincial Government Regulation No.10, 1998); 
2) Provincial Government Regulation No.22, 2000 on “Administering Core Community Plantation Businesses”; 
3) Provincial Government Regulation No.10, 2000 on “Extracting and Using Surface Water”; 
4) Provincial Government Regulation No.16, 2001 on “Management of Ground Water”; and 
5) Provincial Government Regulation No.17, 2001 on “Mining Management”
1) Livestock Health and Animal Product Inspections between the Provinces, Food Rations, as well as Livestock Disease Inspections; 2) Forest Management; 3) Distribution of Forest Products in West Java; 4) Administration of Transport and Communications; and 5) Levies on Administering Transport and Communications
Apart from the provincial government regulations governing services and regional taxes and levies, the West Java Provincial Government has not ratified any regulations creating non-tariff barriers
The existing local government regulations only stipulate the directives on the administration of services, taxes and levies in terms of the target of the tax and those obliged to pay the tax
Government Regulation No.20, 2001 on “Guidance and Supervision of Local Government Administration”, which permits the provincial government to supervise the kabupaten and kota governments has not yet been implemented because as yet there are no implementation guidelines available
Consequently, the supervisory function of the provincial government in regards to local policies which may have some effect on the business climate, is not yet effective
Furthermore, the relevant provincial government offices are also deemed to be unprepared for the task
However, the provincial government has made efforts to provide guidance on the formulation of legislation for all kabupaten and kota in West Java through undertaking an initial evaluation of the formulation process by disseminating questionnaires and conducting interviews with the Heads of the respective Legal Affairs Divisions
The results of this evaluation, particularly in relation to local regulations on taxes and levies, have highlighted that the kabupaten and kota governments are making concerted efforts to find the easiest methods to increase local revenue, for example through creating local regulations on regional taxes and levies
The primary reason for creating these regulations has been that both the General Allocation of Funds and Special Allocation of Funds provided by the central government are insufficient to cover the costs of regional development activities
2
The Kabupaten Level of Government Kabupaten Cirebon To date, the contribution of local revenue to the Kabupaten Cirebon budget is less than 10%, where more than 75% of kabupaten finances relies on subsidies from the central government
For the 2001 budget year, in terms of the components in the modified kabupaten budget draft, the amount of funding outside of deposits and fees for civil servant employees has increased from Rp156 billion in the 1999/2000 budget year to Rp351 billion in the 2001 budget year
The local revenue target has increased from Rp12 billion to Rp18 billion, while local revenue contributions have decreased as a proportion of budget revenue
In the 2001 budget year, the General Allocation of Funds received by the Kabupaten Cirebon government was approximately Rp300 billion, or 85% of the total budget (Rp351 billion)
In terms of the budget allocation for expenses, a large proportion (77%) was used for routine requirements, while Rp79 billion (23%) was allocated for development
Funding allocated for development has increased significantly compared to previous budget years, but has decreased if compared to the size of the sectoral budget
It is estimated that these conditions will weaken the implementation of public services
At the time this research was carried out, the size of the General Allocation of Funds for Kabupaten Cirebon for the 2002 budget year was not clear because the formula used for the calculation was unavailable
The Kabupaten Cirebon government has stated that when seeking sources of local revenue, they continually refer to the limitations stipulated in the current legislation
Even though at present the kabupaten government has more authority, this does not mean that the local government can seek out sources of local revenue by creating as many sources of revenue as possible
Thus, the Kabupaten Cirebon government feels that as yet, there has been no real changes resulting from the implementation of regional autonomy
The kabupaten government is more focussed on efforts to effectively implement and collect existing taxes and levies, which have not been carried out effectively in the past
The local revenue target for the 2001 budget year increased by nearly 50% if compared to the target for the 1999/2000 budget year
The types of taxes and levies effectively charged in the 2001 budget year were generally long-existing charges for which a significant number of local regulations have not been updated (see Table 4)
For the 2002 budget year, the local government plans to impose several new types of taxes and levies, as well as update pre-existing charges
The existing taxes and levies in Kabupaten Cirebon have not been optimally implemented or collected because community awareness of these charges is quite low, especially in terms of the obligatory nature of these charges
For example, a large proportion of hotel and restaurant owners are unwilling to pay tax and avoid paying their dues
They oppose increases in the sales price of goods to cover the cost of the tax because they are concerned that this will cause them to be less competitive with other businesses, and they also object if their profits are reduced by paying taxes
In addition, consumers generally do not want to be taxed
The sanctions for parties not fulfilling their tax obligations have not been fully implemented and this in itself is difficult to carry out because of the difficult circumstances created by the economic crisis and the community “freedom” euphoria following the fall of Suharto which has resulted in a stronger, more vocal community
A snapshot of the efforts being made and the problems faced by the Kabupaten Cirebon government in terms of maximizing tax revenue are evident in the following summary
1
Hotel and Restaurant Tax
Tax payers have demanded a flat rate of tax charged Rp15,000/month, even though restaurant income is usually between Rp50,000 – Rp500,000 per day
A number of businesses are of the opinion that the percentage system is still a burden
2
Entertainment Tax
The same problems have occurred with the entertainment tax as have occurred with the hotel and restaurant tax
Meanwhile, there is only one cinema still in operation in Kabupaten Cirebon
3
Advertisement Tax
This tax provides a substantial amount of revenue, but the kabupaten government has to overcome those who try and avoid their obligation to pay the tax
4
Street Light Tax
This tax is classified as the most efficient in terms of collection because it is collected in cooperation with the State Electricity Company (Perusahaan Listrik Negara – PLN)
However, the local government needs to pay attention to community demands in those housing settlements with no street lights
5
Group C Mining Tax
The Palimanan Cement Factory has provided a significant amount of local revenue for the kabupaten government, even though the calculation of the volume of materials excavated is only based on claims made by the enterprise involved
It seems that the kabupaten government does not yet have an adequate number of staff with technical skills, nor the technology to measure the volume of materials extracted
The Ground and Surface Water Tax is mainly obtained from sugar processing factories
These factories always request tax reductions from the kabupaten government because they are old and no longer operate efficiently
Usually the sugar factories pay approximately Rp600 million in tax per year
However, at the beginning of 2002 the authority over these factories was withdrawn and returned to the provincial government in accordance with Law No 34, 2001
Third party contributions continue to be collected in accordance with the longstanding Local Regulation No 7, 1987 on “Local Revenue from Third Party Contributions”
The revenue from these contributions is not included as a component of taxes or levies, but rather is included in other items in the budget
One third party contribution being imposed at present is a charge on exporting enterprises amounting to Rp10,000/container
The charges are imposed by the local Office of Industry and Trade when the enterprise owner obtains the Origin of Goods Certificate
Each month it is estimated that approximately 800 containers are sent from Kabupaten Cirebon
In the 1999/2000 and 2000 budget years, the Kabupaten Cirebon government still budgeted income from wholesale and retail distribution levies as part of a non-tax budget item in accordance with Provincial Government Regulation No 11, 1998
However, for the 2001 budget year income from these levies will no longer be accounted for in the budget 
because the authority for managing public fish markets remains unclear
To date, this authority is still being contested by the provincial, kabupaten and kota governments
In practice, the collection of public fish markets levies still refers to the stipulations determined in West Java Provincial Government Regulation No 9, 2000 on “Wholesale and Retail Distribution”
The Kabupaten Cirebon government decided to create its own local regulations on the management of public fish markets
Kabupaten Cirebon Government Regulation No.53, 2001 on “Administering Public Fish Auctions” and Kabupaten Cirebon Government Regulation No
54, 2001 on “Public Fish Market Levies”
The kabupaten government is convinced that the management of public fish markets must be handled by the kabupaten government itself
they have ignored the provincial government regulations
This has already been discussed with the provincial government, but as yet no joint agreement has been made
This local regulation stipulates that the administration of fish auctions should be carried out by a fishing cooperative assigned through a Bupati Decision Letter
If a public fish market does not have a fishing cooperative which fulfills the requirements, then the Bupati can nominate another cooperative
These stipulations have given the impression of favoring the cooperatives and not facilitating free market practices
However, these stipulations are actually central government stipulations based on a Joint Decision by the Ministers of Home Affairs, Agriculture, Cooperatives and Small Business Empowerment Decision No 139, 1997
Furthermore, the aim of promoting cooperatives is intended to facilitate their empowerment
Meanwhile, Kabupaten Cirebon Regulation No 54, 2000 stipulates the size of the public fish market levy at 3% of the value of the sale
In addition, there are also charges for the cost of administering public fish auctions, stipulated for the first time at Rp100,000, and Rp25,000 for re-registration
At the time this research was carried out, the kabupaten government had received Rp14 million from the public fish market levies
Both of these charges were ratified in September 2001, and the regulations were created in accordance with Law No 34, 2000
It is planned that these taxes and levies will become effective in the 2002 budget year
The tax on birds nest produce is charged at 10% of the sales price of the produce
The target revenue from this source is Rp155 million
Meanwhile, the public auction documentation levy is fixed at 0.1% of the value of the project, while for those projects carried out through direct appointment the levy imposed is 0.2% of the value of the project
At present, the Kabupaten Cirebon Legal Affairs Division has prepared 18 new draft local regulations, including a regulation on “Local Information System Levies” which is related to supervision of video compact disk (VCDs) rentals and local radio broadcasts
During the discussion about the draft regulations with the local parliament, it seems that the legislature was strongly pushing the local government to increase local revenue through various types of local taxes and levies
In addition, the Kabupaten Cirebon government is continuing to create an inventory of the different types of taxes and levies imposed, including charges imposed by those local government offices no longer in operation
These efforts have been carried out with continued reference to central government legislation (Law No 34, 2000 and Law No 22, 1999) and through taking into account the burden on the local community as well as the possibility of these charges overlapping with other taxes and levies
Consequently, the local government needs to carry out an in-depth study before imposing these charges
The local government also hopes that there is “willingness” on the part of the central government to provide the authority for the kabupaten government to impose charges on several taxes already in existence
This would make a significant contribution to local revenue, for example, taxes on valueadding in telecommunications (telephone services), ground and surface water taxes (preferably by not returning this authority to the provincial government), as well as motor vehicle taxes
It is sufficient that the central or provincial governments only regulate the mechanisms for sharing the revenue
The Kabupaten Cirebon government is also in the process of considering the formulation of several forms of charges in different sectors, including
1) The Food Crops Sub-Division of the Kabupaten Cirebon Office of Agriculture is considering imposing a levy on rice-milling
The size of the charge will be determined based on the capacity of the machine used
In addition, the office is also considering providing directives on the sale of production equipment entering the region, as a source of revenue
This office believes that there are actually many sources of local revenue which could be more profitable based on the principle that if agribusiness practices are soundly implemented and farmers secure genuine levels of output/produce, then the burden of taxes and levies would not seriously impact on farmers income
This would require an active role on the part of the provincial government in coordinating the kabupaten and kota governments to avoid a conflict of interest between regions, particularly in terms of the authority to collect the revenue from the charges
2) The Kabupaten Cirebon Office of Fisheries and Maritime Affairs has already proposed the framework for a draft local regulation on Licenses for Fishing Enterprises (owning vessels under 10 gross tons)
3) The administration of activities and services at the Kabupaten Cirebon Office of Industry and Trade continues to refer to long-standing central government policies
This includes several laws such as Law No 2, 1981 on “Calibration”, Law No 3, 1982 on “Obligatory Business Registration”, and Law No 5, 1984 on “Industry”
To date, the kabupaten government does not have any local regulations that are technical in nature
Consequently, this office has not yet made any contributions to local government revenue
The office plans to submit draft local regulations on industry and trade licenses, which are of a similar nature to those currently being imposed
issuing Proof of Industry Registration (Tanda Pendaftaran Industri – TPI), Industry Licenses (Surat Izin Usaha Industri – SIUI), Proof of Business Registration (Tanda Daftar Perusahaan – TDP), Business Trading Licenses (Surat Izin Usaha Perdagangan – SIUP), and Proof of Warehouse Registration (Tanda Daftar Gudang – TDG)
The concepts behind a large proportion of these local regulations are already in place but the formulation of the relevant local regulations has been delayed because the local government is preoccupied at present with the structure of its organizations and work systems, as well as the main tasks and functions of these offices
4) Actually, the kabupaten government wishes to hold on to its authority in the field of callibration, but the local government also realizes that it does not yet have the means nor the qualified staff to carry out these activities
5) The Kabupaten Cirebon Office of Transport and Communications has formulated regulations on levies on the loading and unloading of goods on public roads, which are to be paid every six months by businesses when their vehicles are inspected
The kabupaten government realizes that these efforts may burden the community, but they continue to impose the charges because the region badly requires additional funding
The Kabupaten Cirebon government has not ratified any policies limiting trade because they do not see any need at present to create policies regulating regional trade activities
Similarly, the market structures are not characterized as monopolistic in nature and there are still many competitors in the market including large businesses making furniture and batik products in partnership with small businesses
Kabupaten Garut Before the implementation of Law No.22, 1999 on “Local Government” and Law No.34, 2000 on “Amendments to Law No 18, 1997 on Taxes and Levies”
there were 21 local regulations on taxes and levies in Kabupaten Garut, six local tax regulations and 15 local levy regulations
all in accordance with Law No 18, 1997
Following the implementation of Law No 22, 1999, the Kabupaten Garut government re-instated a number of local regulations which were abolished through Law No 18, 1997
By October 2001, the Kabupaten Garut government ratified 24 new local regulations, 17 of which concerned taxes and levies (one regulation on taxes and 15 on levies)
Three of these new regulations on taxes and levies modify long-standing local regulations already in effect
streetlight taxes, transport route permits, and sports and recreation facility levies
Meanwhile, the authority over one type of tax was passed on to the provincial government
Consequently, by October 2001, there were 33 local regulations on taxes and levies in effect in Kabupaten Garut (see Table 5)
Even though 17 new local regulations were ratified by mid-2001, not all revenue from these local regulations were estimated in the revised Kabupaten Garut budget for 2001
The revenue from only three of these regulations was targeted in the 2001 budget
1) Motor Vehicle Road Worthiness Levies with a target of Rp68.8 million; 
2) Permits for the Management of Privately Owned Timber with a target of Rp12 million; and, 
3) Fees for the Quality Inspections of Dairy Milk with a target of Rp33 million
The implementation of Law No 18, 1997 on “Local Taxes and Levies” abolished 15 types of levies in Kabupaten Garut, resulting in a loss of Rp800 million in revenue
The ratification of Law No 34, 2000 which revised Law No 18, 1997, created the opportunity for the Kabupaten Garut Government to reinstate the local regulations on taxes and levies which had been abolished
For 2002, it was estimated at the time this research was carried out that the local revenue targets will be even higher because 17 types of new taxes and levies are now effective and another 10 draft regulations on taxes and levies are waiting to be ratified
The 2002 Kabupaten Garut Government budget was not available at the time this research was conducted because it was still being proposed by the local parliament
In the 2001 budget year, local revenue constituted 4% of all income for the Kabupaten Garut Government budget, while the General Allocation of Funds constituted 92% (Rp370 billion)
Under these financial conditions, the respondents from the Local Treasury Office believe that Kabupaten Garut will continue to be financially dependant on the central government, even if it is given full fiscal authority
In terms of expenditure, the proportion of funds allocated for routine expenses and development expenditure has not changed between the 2000 and the 2001 budget years
However, nominally the amount allocated for routine expenses has increased two fold, from Rp131 billion (revenue collected in the nine month financial year) to Rp317 billion (targeted revenue for the 2001 budget year)
The increase in routine expenditure has mainly been allocated for civil servants salaries, amounting to 84% of the Kabupaten Garut Government budget
Back pay for civil servants salaries cannot be taken from the development budget because it has already been allocated for the sectors considered to be of high priority, such as projects which have already gone to tender that cannot be cancelled
In addition, the local government has to provide matching funds for central government projects, such as the Community Empowerment and Local Government Support Program (Pendukung Pemberdayaan Masyarakat dan Pemerintah Daerah – P2MPD) and the Kecamatan Development Program (Program Pembangunan Kecamatan – PPK)
At the end of 2001, the Kabupaten Garut Government was still responsible for the shortfall in civil servant salary back pay which amounted to Rp37 billion
For the Kabupaten Garut government, drafting local regulations on taxes and levies has created a dilemma
On the one hand, in the present era of trade globalization, it is inappropriate for the kabupaten governments to issue regulations which limit community economic activities
However, on the other hand, they are forced to seek out local revenue through increasing taxes and levies which are similarly placing a larger burden on the community, because they have no other avenues available to increase this revenue
Meanwhile, the local assemblies also tend to push for increases in local revenue, because the size of funds provided for the assembly depends on local revenue
Minister of Finance Letter No S-486/MK.07/2001, November 2, 2001 reiterates the local regulations which are under consideration to be revoked
the local regulations issued by the Kabupaten Garut government are not included in this list
At the same time, several things need to be highlighted about the local regulations in Kabupaten Garut, including
1) Levies and definition of services
The types of services provided in return for several new levies are not clear, particularly for the levies categorized in terms of special licensing
For example, the Loading and Unloading Goods Permit Fees and the Management of Privately Owned Timber Permit Fees
2) Levies for the inspection of the quality of dairy milk (Local Regulation No 14, 2001)
Even though the local regulation on these levies was ratified in July 2001, livestock owners requested that the implementation be delayed until January, 2002
However, based on the Financial Status Report for Kabupaten Garut in October 2001, this source of revenue was already targeted at Rp33 million
In spite of this, in October 2001, no revenue had been collected based on this regulation
This means that after paying these levies, they can not be charged again by other local government offices, institutions or at the village level of administration
Before this regulation was ratified, it was discussed with factory representatives (for example Indomilk) in the hope that the factories would be willing to pay the levies
However, the factories rejected the proposal because they are already paying taxes to the central government
The local regulations on animals, livestock, livestock produce, and other byproduct inspection levies (including dairy milk) in other kabupaten are under consideration to be revoked based on the Letter from the Minister of Finance mentioned above
This is because, the inspection of animals/livestock and their by-products should not incur a levy because there are no real services prepared or provided by the local government for public interest or benefit
3) Permits for the Management of Privately Owned Timber (Local Regulation No 9, 2001)
This regulation was ratified in June 2001, and was imposed starting in September 2001
During September, the revenue collected from these levies amounted to Rp7.87 million and by the end of October the entire amount collected (September and October) amounted to Rp11.984 million
Privately owned timber refers to timber produced from land owned by the community, either land owned by individuals or organizations
The levies paid for permits to manage privately owned timber are as follows
Tree felling permits incur a charge of between Rp1,000-Rp2,500 per tree, depending on the type of tree
Transportation of wood incurs a charge of between Rp2,000-Rp3,500/m³, depending on the type of wood, and Rp350/m³ for firewood
Inspections of chainsaws incur a charge of between Rp15,000- Rp100,000/chainsaw, depending on the type of chainsaw
Apart from issues surrounding levies, a large number of complex requirements for obtaining licenses must be fulfilled before the felling begins
it has been difficult to implement this regulation
Even though these levies have been imposed with the good intention of supporting the conservation of natural resources, the complexity of the licensing process may result in the emergence of unofficial taxes, or levies may be charged without providing any supervisory services related to these levies
The same type of local regulations on extracting forest products from land owned by the Kabupaten Bengkulu Selatan government include levies which are under consideration to be abolished in Minister of Finance Letter No S-486/MK.07/2001 
The reasons provided in this letter include
1) Extraction of forest wood products from private land in principle does not need to be controlled by the local governments because there is no aspect of the public interest which needs to be protected;
2) In principle the regions can better optimize the revenue collected through the Land and Building Tax
In addition, the levies on chainsaw inspections are not appropriate
The ownership of chainsaws should not require permits because once again there is no aspect of the public interest requiring protection
4) Levies in the Transport and Communications Sector
The local government office which manages the largest number of local regulations on new taxes and levies is the Office of Transport and Communications
They manage the following local regulations
1
Local Regulation No 4, 2001 on “Motor Vehicle Road Worthiness Levies” with a targeted revenue for July-December 2001 of Rp68 million
This target is only estimated for six months because the regulation was ratified in June 2001 after the beginning of the 2001 budget year
2
Local Regulation No 5, 2001 on “Public Transport Route Permit Levies” with a targeted revenue for July-December 2001 of Rp60 million
3
Local Regulation No 6, 2001 on “Transport Business License Fees” with a targeted revenue for July-December 2001 of Rp9 million
4
Local Regulation No 7, 2001 on “Loading and Unloading Goods License Fees”, with a targeted revenue for July-December 2001 of Rp6 million
5
Local Regulation No 8, 2001 on “Permits for the Use of Roads for Purposes other than Traffic” with a targeted revenue for July-December 2001 of Rp5 million
Even though the Office of Transport and Communications has already targeted the size of the levies which can be collected through Local Regulations No 6, 7, and 8, 2001, based on the report of actual local revenue received by the Kabupaten Garut Government up until October 2001, no revenue has been collected from the levies stipulated in these three local regulations
In fact, these levies have not been included in the report
Representatives from the Office of Transport and Communications have stated that the most difficult problem to overcome is the unofficial taxes charged by both local thugs (preman) and rogue police officials
In the Jonggol and Purwakarta regions, for example, the practice of premanisme continues, where unofficial charges as high as Rp300,000/truck/year are imposed
These people are organized into groups, each of which controls a certain region
As evidence that a truck has passed through one of these regions and paid the “charge”, the code of the name of group leader is usually stamped on the body of the truck
The trucks incur more charges when they enter the wholesale markets in Jakarta
The taxes and levies imposed at the terminals also tend to be more expensive than what is detailed in the regulations because they must cover the costs of honorarium fees for employees and volunteer workers
At present, the cost for drivers license extensions has reached Rp150,000, although the official fee is only Rp52,000
It is also unclear where the money from these services is allocated
Previously, at the time the agreement was made with the PT Citra Nusapala to computerize the issuing of drivers licenses, a large proportion of the revenue was possibly deposited with this enterprise
This discussion of local regulations in Kabupaten Garut indicates that several of the local regulations ratified by the Kabupaten Garut government are similar to the local regulations in other regions which are under consideration to be revoked by the Ministry of Finance
However, these local regulations are not included in the list of local regulations which are being considered to be abolished
This is possibly because the local regulations in question were only ratified in mid-2001 and have not been reported to the central government, whereas the Minister of Finance Letter was issued in November 2001
The majority of local regulations in the list under consideration to be abolished by the Minister of Finance are those which were ratified in 2000
The Legal Affairs Division of the Kabupaten Garut government is aware that there are many weaknesses in the process used to formulate local regulations
Consequently, they hope that they receive input from the central government so that any mistakes or irregularities can be corrected
They also hope that the government, particularly the Department of Home Affairs (Departemen Dalam Negeri – Depdagri), makes available staff who are able to provide consultation on the process of formulating local regulations
The Kabupaten Garut government always sends the ratified local regulations to the Legal Bureau in the Department of Home Affairs hoping that they will receive a response, although to date the central government has given no such response
The provincial government only received these local regulations from the kabupaten, without providing any input or corrections
If this process continues, the local governments may continue to repeat the same mistakes
In addition to the 17 local regulations on new taxes and levies which have already been ratified, the Kabupaten Garut government has also planned to create several new local regulations on other charges
At the time this research was carried out, these were still at the stage of discussion and initial planning, including
The plan to impose charges on birds nest producers
In several other kabupaten in the Province of West Java, similar charges have already been imposed
According to the local Office of Plantations, tobacco farmers which are associated with the Village Cooperative are prepared to provide contributions to the kabupaten government, as are the akar wangi farmers
In relations to this, the local Office of Plantations plans to bring binding third party contributions into effect
Actually, this office has doubts about the proposed charges for plantation commodities as a source of local revenue
However, there continues to be demands to increase local revenue, particularly from local assembly members who are pushing for local regulations to be made in regards to this sector
Based on the Minister of Finance Letter mentioned above, all types of third party contributions, no matter what the target of the charge is, are classified as a part of local regulations under consideration to be revoked
This is because regulations of this nature are in conflict with the public interest, where the contributions are meant to be voluntary, and under no circumstances may payment be forced
The Kabupaten Garut government is considering the possibility of creating a local regulation on vehicles exceeding load capacity, bearing in mind there are several classes of roads
However, this government still requires clarification on the existing classes of roads
The local regulations on vehicles exceeding capacity in other kabupaten, such as those in Kabupaten Indramayu, Batang Hari, and Bekasi, are included in the local regulations which are being considered by the Minister of Finance to be revoked
for the following reasons
1) they are in conflict with Law No 13, 1980 on “Roads” which states that roads are infrastructure for land transportation to be used by general traffic;
2) Law No 14, 1992 on “Road Transport Traffic” which mentions that public use of the roads must be in accordance with the use and classification of the road; and 
3) the payment system for road infrastructure which is applied at present already charges people who use the road through Motor Vehicle Registration Tax and Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax
In Kabupaten Garut no non-tariff regulations were found which regulated the trade of goods and services
However, recently, there have been complaints from the tea leaf processing factories that they have been experiencing problems with tea leaf supplies because many farmers are selling their tea to the factories in Kabupaten Tasikmalaya which borders Kabupaten Garut
In light of this, the factories in Kabupaten Garut have requested that the local government issue prohibitions on farmers selling their tea leaves outside of the kabupaten
The local Office of Plantations has not yet responded to these demands
For the moment, this office is endeavoring to provide information with more appropriate objectives, appeal to factories in Kabupaten Garut so that they pay the farmers and trades more quickly, and to coordinate the Kabupaten Tasikmalaya Office of Plantations in terms of the quality of tea leaves being sold to the factories
In 1990, the Province of West Java implemented a tea trading zone system
At the time, farmers from certain regions were compelled to sell their tea to the PT
Since 1998, this system was no longer imposed even though the regulations have not formally been abolished
Kabupaten Ciamis The Kabupaten Ciamis Government has also ratified new local regulations following the release of Law No 22, 1999 and Law No 34, 2000
Up until November 2001, the Kabupaten Ciamis government had already ratified 27 new local regulations, 19 of these being related to taxes, levies (16) and other charges (two) which are included in other items of income under the sub-item of third party contributions (see Table 6)
From the 19 local regulations mentioned above, six of these were revisions of local regulations already in effect
The remainder are new local regulations created as a result of the shift of authority from the central and provincial governments to the kabupaten and kota governments based on Government Regulations No 25, 2000, as well as reinstating local regulations which were abolished by Law No 18, 1997 (for example, the local regulation on “Printing and Certification Fees”
The contents of a number of new local regulations requiring close attention include
The Management and Cultivation of Birds Nests (Local Regulation No 27, 2001)
This local regulation has been formulated based on Law No
34, 2000 which gives the regions a chance to determine taxes outside of those outlined in the present laws
A number of local regulations on similar taxes on commodities (both goods and services) in other regions are presently being considered to be revoked based on the Letter from the Minister of Finance
Permits for the Use of Public Roads and the Loading and Unloading of Goods (Local Regulation No 17, 2001), Administrative Service Fees for Privately Owned Forest Produce Businesses (Local Regulation No 19, 2001), and License Fees and Costs of Unloading Advertisements in Kabupaten Ciamis (Local Regulation No 9, 2001)
In other kabupaten, these three taxes are under consideration to be abolished
The reasons given for why the regulation on License Fees and Costs of Unloading Advertisements in Kabupaten Ciamis is being considered to be revoked include
1) this charge is collected as a tax, therefore the amount which has to be paid does not depend on the costs incurred in the unloading process; and 2) advertisements are already taxed and therefore this additional charge will only become a larger burden for the community
Auction Document Fees (Local Regulation No.24, 2001) and Public Mining in Kabupaten Ciamis (Local Regulation No 13, 2001)
These two regulations are not considered to be levies according to the local government budget, instead they are deemed to be “other income” in the sub-section on third party contributions
This contravenes the principle of voluntary contributions
Both regulations impose charges fixed at an amount in accordance with the tasks carried out
In addition, third party contributions are included amongst the local regulations which are being considered to be abolished through the Letter from the Minister of Finance
Before these new local regulations on taxes and levies were introduced, the local revenue section of the Kabupaten Ciamis government budget for 2000 included six local taxes, 17 levies as well as additional third party contributions which were included as ‘other income'
The tax on the use of ground and surface water is no longer collected as the authority to do so has been passed on the provincial government
With the addition of new local regulations on taxes, namely the Management and Cultivation of Birds Nests Tax, the number of taxes in the Kabupaten remains at six
Meanwhile, the new fees or levies introduced have increased their total to 27, and an additional two charges classified as third party contributions in the ‘other income' section have also been introduced
All of these new local regulations on taxes and levies, except the regulation on Control and License Service Fees for Waste Disposal Businesses are targeted to be included in the changes to the 2001 local government budget
A large proportion of the targeted revenue for 2001 budget year comes from Public Fish Auction Levies (Rp297.5 million) and Motor Vehicle Inspection Levies (Rp252 million)
The total revenue target from these new regulations for the 2001 budget year is Rp988.46 million, and is estimated to increase to Rp1,172.8 million for the 2002 budget year
Yet, the local government has lost one tax, the tax on the use of ground and surface water, which during the 2000 budget year accounted for Rp64 million in revenue (see Table 7)
The local revenue target for the 2002 budget year, with the implementation of these new taxes and levies is estimated to reach Rp13.3 billion, an increase of 60% compared to the total amount of local revenue collected in 2000
The Kabupaten Ciamis government is making efforts to increase local revenue not only by adding to the number of charges through the creation of new local regulations, but also by increasing the charges imposed by the regulations already in place
For example, the total of revenue collected from Hotel and Restaurant Taxes in the 2000 budget year amounted to Rp487 million, yet the revenue target for this same tax in the 2002 budget year has almost doubled, making it Rp850 million
Another examples is the Market Levy, the revenue collected from this levy in the 2000 budget year amounted to Rp472 million, meanwhile the target for this same levy in the 2002 budget year is Rp2.75 billion, five times that amount
Kabupaten Ciamis has already conducted a follow up step after the implementation of decentralization, by issuing Bupati Decision No 80, 2001 which delegates a part of the Kabupaten's authority to the kecamatan
A portion of this delegated authority is related to levies and charges
The following constitutes three examples indicating how authority has been delegated in part to the kecamatan
Local Regulation No 26, 2001 on “Amendments to Kabupaten Ciamis Local Regulation No.21, 2001 on Building Permit Levies”
The authority which has been delegated to the kecamatan concerns the writing-off of building permit levies
Local Regulation No.20, 2000 on Noise/Disturbance License Fees
The kecamatan have been delegated the authority to be in charge of this licensing process for rice-milling enterprises and mobile saw mills
Local Regulation No 18, 2001 on Transport Route Permits
The kecamatan have been delegated the authority to update the registration of public transport in rural areas
The community in general will benefit, particularly business people, because they will no longer need to go all the way to the Kabupaten Government Office to obtain their licenses if the kecamatan are really delegated this authority
III
THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND LOCAL REGULATIONS
Local regulations, especially those relating to business licenses, taxes, levies and other forms of fees such as third party contributions, have a direct effect on the business climate in the region
Furthermore, the business climate directly impacts on improvements in national economic performance which has until now remained poor
In other words, local regulations which have the potential to disturb the business environment will impede national economic recovery
In line with this, it is not suprising that the problem of local regulations has attracted the attention of international donar institutions and has been addressed in Indonesia's Letter of Intent (LoI) submitted to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
This indicates that the regulations created by local governments, although confined to certain areas, will continue to have a serious national impact
The business community has often voiced their objections to increases in various taxes and levies imposed by the local governments
An example of this can be seen in letter No 238/GPP/IX/2001, dated September 4, 2001 sent to the Governor of West Java by the Association of Plantation Businesses (GPP)
In this letter, the association explained that several local regulations on taxes and levies have recently been issued by the kabupaten, kota and village governments
The Association of Plantation Businesses considers these taxes and levies to be a burden, because they increase production costs without raising the level of valueadded production
As a result, GPP are proposing that the Provincial government apply Government Regulation No
20, 2001 on “Guidance and Supervision of Kabupaten and Kota Governent Administrations”
A few of these contested local regulations in the agricultural sector include
1) Local regulations on ground and surface water taxes
Law No
34, 2000 states that these taxes are provincial government taxes
However, a number of kabupaten, for example, Kabupaten Bandung, Cianjur, Sukabumi and Garut have both created their own local regulations and now collect the revenue from them themselves
In addition to overlapping taxes, the amount of each tax differs depending on the kabupaten
For example, in Kabupaten Bandung water incurs a charge of Rp350/m3, and Rp189/m3 in Kabupaten Sukabumi, whereas the Kabupaten Garut and Kabupaten Cianjur governments charge Rp1,250 and Rp7,500 respectively per hectare of plantation land
2) Local regulations on fees for intended relocations based on the extension of leasehold certificates in Kabupaten Lebak
According to the Association of Plantation Businesses, fees of this nature should only be charged for new projects which require new locations
it is inappropriate to collect fees for requests to extend plantation leasehold certificates
3) Local regulations on agricultural and plantation produce
These regulations are imposed in Kabupaten Cianjur, where Rp15 is charged per kilogram and collected from factories processing tea obtained from community owned tea plantations
Kabupaten Tasikmalaya is presently drafting a local regulation which will impose a tax of Rp5 on every kilogram of produce
Kabupaten Sukabumi has already issued a local regulation on fees for the inspection of farm produce
The village of Cicadas in Kecamatan Sagalaherang, Kabupaten Subang charges farmers Rp2 per kilogram for young tea leaves
1
The Provincial Level The implementation of regional autonomy has brought drastic changes to several aspects of local government
This is evident in the increasingly limited authority of the provincial government
For example, the authority of the Provincial Office of Industry and Trade is presently restricted to the field of metrology
Even in this field, their authority is limited to consumer protection, rather than regulatory directives
One staff member from this office stated that there was really no need for a Provincial Office of Industry and Trade because the kabupaten and kota governments have already been given the authority to carry out most duties
Since the implementation of regional autonomy, the provincial government has not issued any regulations relating to industry and trade activities, or the business environment in general
The transfer of authority from the Provincial government to the kabupaten and kota governments has resulted in poor coordination of aspects relating to trade and industrial development
For example, sound coordination is required if Kabupaten A is to provide industry licenses, when waste products from the enterprise concerned are disposed of in rivers or in the air within the boundaries of Kabupaten B or even Kabupaten C, as this will consequently burden both neighboring Kabupaten
It is also a concern that as a result of poor coordination, trade blocks between areas will be set up because each area would like to protect their own commodities which they consider to be of superior quality compared to other regions
In addition, the tendency for the kabupaten and kota governments to increase local revenue through the implementation of taxes and levies does not positively contribute to the business climate
At the same time, this does not mean that the provincial government is no longer interested in increasing their local revenue
For example, West Java Provincial Regulations No 8, 2000 and No 9, 2000 on wholesale distribution, have been imposed in order to collect public fish market levies
A number of kabupaten and kota governments have begun to oppose this, as public fish markets are already included within their authority
In addition to the levies on public fish markets, the provincial government is endeavoring to find other sources of local revenue from the fisheries sector, for example, through the regulation of fishing permits for boats weighing between 10-30 GT, certificates ensuring the quality of fingerlings, and certificates ensuring the quality of fish produce for export
In the plantations and forestry sector, there is still an overlap between the authority of the provincial government and the authority which has been passed on to the kabupaten and kota governments
For example, Local Regulations No 23, 2000 on Tree Felling and No 24, 2000 on Tea Processing Enterprises are actually in conflict with local regulations in Kabupaten Cianjur, Garut, Ciamis and Tasikmalaya which regulate the same matters
2
The Kabupaten Level Kabupaten Cirebon Public policy on the development of industry and trade in Kabupaten Cirebon focusses on
1) Developing commodities which are considered profitable, for example, rattan, batik and rubber sandals; 2) Developing the manufacturing industry as well as agroindustry which will include gem stones, garments, melinjo chips, timber for the construction of furniture, fried onion garnish, and snacks through local industry centres; and 3) Developing small-scale industries
In order to develop these industries as well as trade, the Kabupaten Cirebon government has yet to create any specific local regulations within the sector
The market and industry structure set up for all products relies completely on market mechanisms
The kabupaten government is aware that economic activities will continue to be carried out efficiently provided that the local government does not intervene and create market distortions
As a result, the kabupaten government does not see any reason to create policies which regulate production activities and the trading system in the region
Furthermore, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry stated that the implementation of regional autonomy in Kabupaten Cirebon has not disrupted business activities so far
In other words, Kabupaten Cirebon, in implementing regional autonomy, has taken a “friendly” approach towards the entire business community in the region, no matter how large or small the enterprise
Nevertheless, in order to anticipate and ensure that no local regulations which may disrupt the business environment in the future are created, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry has decided to play an active role in providing input and policy recomendations to the Kabupaten Cirebon government
According to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, current obstacles for the business environment in Cirebon are actually the result of local regulations in other regions
For example, the rattan industry in Cirebon is presently experiencing difficulties in obtaining raw materials
This is because the government in the region where rattan is being produced has issued a regulation permitting the export of raw rattan, resulting in a shortage of rattan supplies in Cirebon
Regional autonomy should not be interpreted to suggest that every business activity must only concern itself with the interests of the region, on the contrary, it should be placed within a national framework, where national interests are taken into account
Nevertheless, in this era of regional autonomy, business activities should be kept open, in the sense that each region should not isolate itself
Regional autonomy needs to ensure cooperation between the regions, between kabupaten and kota as well as between provinces, and it should avoid creating conditions which result in isolation and urbanization which can have a deterimental effect on all concerned
The general trade and industry regulations presently in effect in Kabupaten Cirebon still refer to policies issued by the central government, for example, Law No 2, 1981 on “Metrology”, Law No 3, 1982 on “Compulsory Business Registration” and Law No 5, 1984 on “Industry”
Revenue from various trade and industry services is still being handed over to the central government
Within the framework of implementing regional autonomy, the Kabupaten Cirebon government, through the Office of Trade and Industry, have planned to draft a local regulation on trade and industry licencing
The licences which have been planned for implementation are the same as those currently being imposed, covering industry registration, industry licences, business registration, trade licences and warehouse registration
The only difference between these licences and those presently in place is the government responsible for collecting the revenue
If the central government currently has the right to collect these taxes and levies, these draft regulations will allow the kabupaten government to collect the same revenue from these chareges in the future
1) Batik Products Business people producing batik have stated that they are yet to obtain any information on the implementation of regional autonomy, nor have they attended any sessions aimed at publicizing the issue
Regional autonomy is yet to have an impact on their business activities
The Kabupaten Cirebon government is yet to issue any specific form of regulation on batik
Nevertheless, if under regional autonomy, the kabupaten government decides to issue a regulation on batik enterprises, especially if they are intending to impose taxes or levies on them, these businesses have requested that they are invited to discuss the issue from its conception
One respondent who is also Head of the Cirebon Batik Cooperative stated that at present, the batik industry is becoming increasingly isolated from other garment industries, such as those producing shirts or other items of clothing made at a very low cost from high quality fabrics
At one stage, this batik cooperative had a membership of 700 businesses spread throughout Cirebon
However, only around 20- 25% of members remain active in the industry
2) Rattan Products Until now, regional autonomy has had neither a positive or negative effect on the business environment in the rattan sector
The present sluggish business environment is a result of numerous political demonstrations and an uncertain security situation leaving a number of foreign buyers hesitant to conduct business in Indonesia
In addition, the Cirebon rattan industry is experiencing other problems including difficulties obtaining sufficient supplies of raw materials
This is because nowadays the central government allows the export of raw rattan
As a result, rattan producing areas such as Sulawesi and Kalimantan prefer to export their products rather than make them available domestically
Although the export of raw rattan currently incurs a 30% export tax, foreign sales remain more profitable compared to domestic sales
For example, raw rattan can fetch a price of US$2 per kilogram overseas, while if it is sold domestically it can generally only fetch a price of Rp10,000 per kilogram, or US$1 at the present exchange rate of Rp9,900
Third party contributions collected directly from rattan businesses amount to Rp10,000 per container
This levy was previously abolished, but was reinstated at the beginning of January 2001
The levy is collected by the local Office of Trade and Industry when the exporter arranges their Certificate of Origin (CO)
Rattan exporters who arrange their CO in Cirebon incur this charge, while exporters who arrange their CO in Jakarta (approximately 10-20%) do not have to pay
In addition to third party contributions, rattan businesses also incur other taxes and levies which are also effective for other businesses, including a ground and surface water tax, reforestation levy and informal port charges
Business people in the rattan industry consider that these taxes and levies are still reasonable and therefore they have never complained
3) Fishing Produce During this era of regional autonomy, the Kabupaten Cirebon government has begun to regulate fishing produce through Local Regulation No 53, 2001 on “Administering Public Fish Auctions” and Local Regulation No 54, 2001 on “Levies on Fish Auctions”
These two local regulations are yet to come into effect as they are still being introduced and publicized to the community, but are most likely to be brought into effect during the 2002 budget year
Presently, public fish auction levies still refer to local regulations formulated by the provincial government, and therefore the revenue collected is still passed on to the provincial government treasury
In Local Regulation No 9, 2000 on “Retail and Wholesale Distribution Levies” in the Province of West Java, fish auction levies are set at 5%
Of this, 3% is paid by the purchaser and passed on directly to the kabupaten government treasury, while the remaining 2% is borne by the fishermen and organized through the fishing cooperatives
Village government administration has questioned the 3% of total revenue collected by the provincial government treasury which has been allocated for development in the region (the place where the public fish markets exist)
They are of the opinion that a portion of these funds should be given to the villages directly
However, according to staff from the Local Office of Fisheries in Kabupaten Cirebon, these funds are distributed indirectly to the villages, through supporting sectors, such as through public works and education
Of the nine public fish markets in Kabupaten Cirebon, only four are actually in operation
located in Karangreja, Bondet, Ender and Gebang Mekar
There are approximately 2,800 fishermen who sell their goods at the public fish market in Gebang Mekar, yet the local fishing coperative (KUD Mina) only has a membership of 200 fishermen and traders
Only a small group of fishermen have decided to become members of this cooperative as they feel that there are few benefits for members
Most of the fishermen rely on the capital borrowed from small and large scale traders to purchase their fishing equipment and ensure they can carry out their activities at sea
Fishermen generally sell their catch directly to both large and small scale traders
Most fishermen have debit and credit arrangements with one of these traders, and therefore do not have the flexibility to sell their fish to any other trader
These small-scale traders then sell the catch to cold storage companies
There are seven cold storage companies which buy fish from the public fish markets, three of these companies specifically store crabs, while the other four store anchovies
The fishermen's primary catch includes both crabs and anchovies and is sold at the Gebang Mekar public fish market
One cold storage company representative stated that larger traders who generally own the boats used by the fishermen, work together with the companies to supply them with anchovies
Two of these larger traders coordinate approximately 100 boats which supply this company with anchovies
These large scale traders carry out transactions with the fishermen or the small-scale traders at the public fish market
By doing this they receive a commision from the company based on the quality of the anchovies
Presently, the purchasing price of raw anchovies is between Rp10,000 and Rp13,000 per kilogram
The large scale traders receive a commission of between Rp500 and Rp600 per kilogram
This company packages the produce, before sending it to Gresik for the final preparations, where it is then exported to Japan via Surabaya
This factory can accommodate between 2-3 tons of anchovies per day
There are four similar factories which purchase anchovies from the public fish market in Gerbang Mekar
These companies compete freely and the Kabupaten Cirebon government does not intervene in the process
According to the Head of the Local Branch Office of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, the primary difficulty for the fishermen is their lack of capital and equipment
Most fishermen only own a small boat (payang) which can only be used within a two mile radius of the land and only at certain times of the year
Just a few fishermen have the certain senggol type of fishing gear which allows them to fish up to depths of three nautical miles, throughout the whole year
4) Onion Products Red onions are another important commodity for farmers in Kabupaten Cirebon
Large fluctuations in the price of onions and the desire to produce value-added products has motivated the Kapubaten Cirebon community to develop this product further, by creating business opportunities through fried onions
No regulation has been uncovered thus far that in anyway impedes these activities, on either the onion farming or fried onion enterprise levels
Onion products do not incur taxes, levies or any other charges
Kabupaten Garut 1) Community Owned Tea Plantation Products Plantation products which have become important economically in Kabupaten Garut include tea, akar wangi, and tabacco
In particular regard to the tea sector, the tea factory owners in Kabupaten Garut have started to complain that it is becoming even harder to obtain unprocessed raw materials than it was previously
The problem is not that production rates have declined, rather, the market is starting to focus its attention on supplying tea leaves to factories in Kabupaten Tasikmalaya
In reaction to this, factory owners in Garut have appealed for the Kabupaten Garut Offices of Plantations to prohibit the farmers from selling tea leaves outside the kabupaten, or at least return to the previous system whereby zones for the marketing of tea leaves are set in place
The Local Office of Plantations have paid little attention to the factory owners' appeals, remaining tied to the principal that in this era of globalization, there should be no regulations limiting trade
Tea farmers and traders in Kabupaten Garut have shifted their attention to the market in Kabupaten Tasikmalaya because factory owners in Tasikmalaya pay in cash, within seven days of the transaction being made
In addition, they are prepared to buy tea leaves of any quality at higher prices than the factories in Kabupaten Garut are willing to pay
Issues concerning Taxes and Levies
In July 2001, the village government administration throughout Kecamatan Pakenjeng agreed to impose a levy on the trading of tea
At the time, the levy was fixed at Rp25 per kilogram and paid by the tea processing factory
Nevertheless, the factory owners were only prepared to pay Rp10 per kilogram
This levy should be borne by the factory owners and not the farmers
However, the government remains concerned that eventually factory owers will pass the levy on to the farmers
The Market and Prices
Farmers sell their tea leaves through middle-men in their villages
In Kampung Belebat, in the Jatiwangi village, there are four middle-men
A large proportion of the tea leaves from this village are sold to processing factories in the Pamegatan village, Kecamatan Pakenjeng
Some of the tea leaves are sold to factories outside of the kecamatan, for example, PT
Megawati in Kecamatan Cipangramatan, PT
Gopindo in Kecamatan Cikajang and one other company in Kecamatan Cisurupan
Farmers are presently selling their tea leaves for Rp600 per kilogram, but before the September 11 bombing, tea leaves were being sold for Rp800 per kilogram
The cost of harvesting the tea leaves is Rp125 per kilogram
Traders sell the tea leaves to factories for Rp625-650 per kilogram
The cost of transporting the tea leaves to the factory is borne by the processing factory
The traders bear the cost of the loss of volume resulting from the drying process, as well as labor costs
These traders make a profit of approximately Rp25 per kilogram
Traders obtain information on prices from the factories
If there is a sudden drop in prices which does not allow time for the factory to inform the traders, the factory will buy the tea leaves at the old price
The traders pay the farmers in cash
However, payments from the factories to the traders are often delayed for between two weeks and two months
Some farmers are forced to sell their tea to certain traders because they have a debt with them for supplying agricultural goods, such as fertilizer
Traders providing the capital enabling farmers to continue their production are paid back in installments of Rp100 per kilogram every time a sale takes place
Generally, they are able to clear their debts in three months
A system of free trade ensuring that farmers no longer have to sell their tea to PT
Teh Nusamba is considered to be extremely beneficial for the farmers
Nowadays, the farmers are free to sell their tea to the traders who give them the best price and at their desired location
Plasma Estates
Most of the people living in Kampung Halimun, in the village of Jatiwangi are indigenous to the area, whereas most of the people living in Kampung Balebat are migrants from Kabupaten Tasikmalaya
Every person trading in young tea leaves in this village has formed a clientele group with a number of farmers, based on the block of plantations around where they live
In order to ensure that the farmers sell their produce to the respective traders, the traders lend the farmers capital, generally in the form of fertilizer
The traders sell their tea leaves to PT Sami Jaya in the village of Taraju, Tasikmalaya, which is 55km from their village
Tea leaf sales amounting to approximately one ton take place in Taraju every two days, and transactions are in cash
The taxes and levies which have become burdensome for the traders include unofficial charges amounting to Rp25,000 per month
These unofficial levies are apparently imposed for the maintenance of the roads in the village because they are often used by large trucks carrying tea
Similarly, in Kampung Balebat, a free and competitive system for the marketing of tea has been established between the farmers and traders as well as between the traders and factories
In addition to monthly taxes and levies, the village government once planned to impose a levy of Rp50 for every kilogram of tea sold but the farmers rejected their proposal
In regard to the village levy of Rp10 per kilogram, which is to be paid by the factory owners, the farmers have yet to agree because it is not clear where the funds collected from this levy will be used
2) Leather Products The leather tanning and handicraft industries which have proliferated recently in Kabupaten Garut remain free of local government intervention
The Kabupaten Garut government have not issued any tariff or non-tariff regulations in this sector
3) Cow's Milk Products Another important part of the informal sector in Kabupaten Garut revolves around the production of cow's milk
One village cooperative in Kecamatan Cisurupan has a membership of 1,800 people who keep 6,000 head of cows
They are able to produce 14,000 litres of milk per day
The milk which is stored or bought by the village cooperative is sent to PT
Indomilk or PT Susu Bendera
Local thugs imposing unofficial levies on the transportation of milk have become a problem for the local cooperative, for example, in Jonggol the cooperative must pay the local thugs Rp200,000 per month to ensure the smooth delivery of the milk
The Kabupaten Garut government believes that developing the informal sector activities such as those in the milk sector have the potential to increase their local revenue
As a result, they have imposed a levy on milk which is fixed at Rp4 per litre
Originally, the local government fixed the levy at Rp6 per litre
However, because of the objections from the livestock owners, the levy was eventually set at Rp4 per litre after a meeting was held to discuss the issue with local government representatives, the village assembly, and the village cooperatives
The village cooperative requested that the kabupaten government delay the implementation of this levy throughout Kabupaten Garut until January 2002
This delay constituted a compromise, after the livestock owners voiced their objections to paying the levy
In addition to the delay, the kabupaten government and the village cooperative also agreed that this levy be the last one imposed, meaning that no other government office whatsoever be allowed to impose any other form of tax or levy on this village cooperative
This agreement is extremely important for the village cooperative because previously the Village Representative Board (BPD) also intended to impose a levy which would be collected for use by the village treasury
4) Akar Wangi Products The cultivation of the akar wangi which is used in the production of vetiver oil has been florishing in Kabupaten Garut since the 1950's
At the peak of production in the 1970's, Kecamatan Samarang alone had 60 vetiver oil refineries in operation
However, four years ago there was only 14 oil refineries left in Garut, and presently there are only five in operation on a regular basis
Akar wangi is generally intercropped with potatoes, tomatoes or legumes
Every hectare of akar wangi produces a yield of approximately 20 tons
Production costs are approximately Rp4 million/ha per year (taking into account the cost of fertilizer and labor)
The farmers sell their yield directly to the oil refineries in their area
Presently, farmers are able to sell akar wangi for between Rp500 and Rp800 per kilogram depending on its quality
At this stage, the farmers have neither the desire nor the interest to form groups or cooperatives
Each farmer acts independently when it comes to the cultivation and marketing of akar wangi
From every 1.3 tons of akar wangi (the per-unit capacity of an oil refinery) 3.5-5kg of vetiver oil can be produced
Vetiver oil is currently being sold for Rp210,000 per kilogram
The refinery owners sell the vetiver oil to middle-men in Garut
There is only one middle-man in Kecamatan Samarang who also buys patchouli and citronella oil
Both the patchouli and citronella oil bought in this kecamatan is sold in Jakarta
Generally, the oil refinery owners are bound to the vetiver oil traders as they rely on them for capital to ensure they can continue to distil the oil
Loan repayments are calculated when the refinery owners sell their produce
Often traders also offer up to Rp30 million as a special type of ‘interest free loan' for oil refinery owners
If a loan of this nature is obtained, the oil refinery owners are forced to sell their produce to the trader who provides them with the loan
The full amount of the loan must be repaid if the oil refinery discontinues its operations
Oil refinery owners who are bound by these loans sell their produce to their trader at a price far below the market rate, for example, for Rp180,000 per kilogram compared to a market price of Rp210,000 per kilogram
Presently, neither the kabupaten nor the village governments impose any taxes or levies on the akar wangi farmers
The only levy which exists in this sector is imposed on the oil refinery owners who must have a noise/disturbance permit, which is valid for five years from the time it is issued
In 1995 the cost of obtaining this permit was Rp150,000
IV
THE TRENDS IN THE IMPACT OF REGULATIONS 
Regional autonomy was formally implemented beginning on the 1st of January 2001, meaning that it has been in place for approximately one year
However, in practice, the regions are not yet able to implement all aspects of regional autonomy
One obstactle to this is that the central government regulatory guidelines on implementation are still incomplete
In addition, some legislation formulated by the regions, for example, local regulations on taxes, levies and charges can not be issued immediately for technical, administrative and political reasons
As a result, both the general impact of regional autonomy and the specific impact of regulations formulated by the local government on the business environment as yet cannot be identified or empirically evaluated
Nevertheless, in scrutinizing the various trends in the implementation of regional autonomy like those that have been mentioned in the previous chapters, it appears that regional autonomy has had a negative impact on the business environment in particular, and many are now concerned about the provision of public services
1
The unclear division of authority between the provincial and kabupaten governments tends to create duplicate levies and vertical conflict
There are presently a number of overlapping local regulations on taxes, levies and charges in West Java because they have been issued by both the provincial government as well as the kabupaten and kota governments
For example, both the Provincial Government of West Java and a number of kabupaten governments such as Kabupaten Cirebon and Kabupaten Ciamis have created their own local regulations on public fish market levies
Before Government Regulation No 25, 2000 was brought into effect, the provincial government had the full authority to collect public fish market levies, and the kabupaten and kota governments would receive a share of the revenue
However, with the implementation of this law, the authority to collect public fish market levies should have already been transferred to the kabupaten and kota governments
Furthermore, representatives from the provincial government have stated that they already made an agreement that the kabupaten and kota governments will not formulate their own local regulations on public fish market levies, rather they will refer to the provincial regulations which already exist
Yet, in reality, several kabupaten have already formulated local regulations on public fish markets, and will ignore the existing provincial regulations
The existence of overlapping local regulations of this type indicates that the implementation of regional autonomy is still quite unclear, and that each level of government tends to justify their own actions
For example, provincial government representatives, have stated that certain powers should remain under the authority of the provincial government because the kabupaten and kota governments still have limited means and technical skills
Motor vehicle inspections, for example, require special equipment and skills which until now only the provincial government has been able to provide
Conversely, the kabupaten and kota government representatives have stated that technical issues of this nature can not be used as a reason to reduce the authority of the kabupaten and kota governments
The kabupaten and kota governments still have the desire to control the authority, which they consider to be within their rights, and share the revenue from the taxes and levies with the province, rather than the other way round
In doing this the kabupaten and kota governments have referred to Article 8 of Law No 22, 1999 which states that “government authority transferred to the regions within the framework of decentralization must be accompanied by the transfer of funding, equipment and infrastructure as well as human resources, in accordance with the authority being transferred”
Government Regulation No 25, 2000 states that motor vehicle inspections are under the authority of the kabupaten and kota governments
2
Too many local regulations on taxes and levies can become a boomerang for the local government
Letter No
238/GPP/IX/2001 from The Association of Plantation Businesess (GPP) states that at present there are many local regulations stipulating taxes and levies on plantation businesses, which are being issued by the kabupaten governments and even the village governments
They feel that these taxes and levies are creating difficulties for plantation businesses because they increase production costs without raising the levels of value-added production
A trend like this can create a boomerang effect for the regional governments, because plantation businesses, especially those which are protected by associations can make agreements to reject all forms of taxes and levies imposed by the regional governments
Instead of attracting investors – which is extremely important for regional and national economic growth – business people can simply relocate their business to another region where the local government has more conducive policies
An even worse scenario is that in this era of globilization, excessive regulations on taxes and levies imposed by the local governments could cause business people to relocate their businesses overseas
There would be severe economic and social repercussions if this was to occur, for example, local governments would have to deal with the problem of unemployment
In consideration of all this, a business or industry's contribution to a region should not only be evaluated on how much it contributes to the local government treasury, but how much it contributes to other social and economic activities
In other words, it is not completely correct for local governments to state that businesses “must” contribute funds to their treasury
In creating work opportunities, businesses are in fact contributing something to the local government, as they play a role in reducing unemployment
3
Complicated licencing procedures create unofficial taxes and a high cost economy
One such example identified in Kabupaten Garut is based on the Bupati's decision outlined in Letter No.405, 2001 on Implementation Guidelines for Kabupaten Garut Local Regulation No 9, 2001 concerning Permits for the Management of Privately Owned Timber
This decision requires every person or group involved in the felling of trees to submit a written request to the Head of the Kabupaten Office of Plantations and Forestry, and a copy for the Head of the Local Branch Office of Plantions and Forestry
The following information must be attached to this request
1) a photo copy of the applicant's identification card (KTP); 
2) proof of land and building tax payments; 
3) a land and tree ownership certificate from the Head of the local desa/kelurahan; 
4) proof of purchase if the trees have been bought from another party; 
5) a declaration stating that the applicant is capable of providing seeds and will replant the site where the trees have been cut down, written on legally certified paper; 
6) an official document indicating which trees are of an age and can be cut down; 
7) a map or sketch of the tree felling area; and
8) imformation on the type and number of trees that are going to be cut down
An investigatory commision needs first to be established in order to obtain a tree felling permit for certain species planted by the State Owned Forest Enterprise, for example, teak, mahogany, pine, resin, Indian rosewood, accacia, and rasamala (Altingia excelsa)
The commission should consist of the Head of the Branch and Kabupaten Offices of Forestry and Plantations, a local technical official from the local Office of Forestry and Plantations and a local official from the State Owned Forest Enterprise
This commission investigates the request in the field
In addition, to ensure that the transportation, authorization and ownership of the felled trees is valid, those people involved in these processes must submit a request for a Legality of Forest Products Certificate which is issued by the Kabupaten Office of Forestry and Plantations
1) a photo copy of the applicant's tree felling licence;
2) proof of tree felling licence payment; 
3) information on the type of vehicle which is to be used to transport the timber; 
4) a production report; and 
5) a report on the timber prepared for transport
As part of their duties, the commission is required to prepare a report on their field inspections which must be authorized by the Assistant at the State Owned Forest Enterprise or the Head of the local division of the same forest enterprise, the Head of the kecamatan, and the Head of the Police Force at the Kecamatan level
These requirements must be fulfilled by any person or body in Kabupaten Garut who intends to fell more than ten trees on their own land
This local regulation on tree felling has good intentions, namely to monitor, control, utilize, supervise, rehabilitate and restore the ecological, economic and social functions of the land
However, the complicated licencing procedures tend to make implementation difficult
People in the community who still own trees generally live in rural areas, far from any Office for Forestry and Plantations
The various requirements which applicants must fulfill before submitting their request to obtain permission to fell trees tends to be quite costly
In addition, the complicated procedures also create the opportunity for unofficial taxes and levies to be collected, which in addition to increasing costs, also tends to disregard the important supervisory role of the regulation
Prior to the implementation of Law No
18, 1997, there were quite a number of levies of this sort
During this period, the levies collected did not result in services, rather they were more like a “tax”
Levies of this sort include the cattle identity card levy, livestock health inspection levy, and fresh dairy milk levy
Ultimately, these types of taxes and levies resulted in a high cost economy
The impact of this high cost economy was not only felt by the community, but also the local governments which had to allocate more funds (for carrying out inspections and paying staff wages) than they were actually receiving from the levies they were collecting
This is because the Local Treasury Office only received a small income and also a large proportion of the levies collected went straight into the “pockets” of the levy collectors, rather than into the local treasury
4
Increasing the types of taxes has become one alternative for the local government to avoid providing direct services
Law No 34, 2000 provides the local government with the opportunity to collect local taxes in addition to the taxes which have already been stipulated (the provinces have four types of taxes, and the kabupaten and kota have seven types of taxes), based on a number of criteria
This has created one alternative for the local governments endeavoring to increase local revenue
In fact, there have not been many kabupaten or kota governments which have created local regulations on taxes, because the regulations containing the techincal guidelines which support Law No
34, 2000 have only just been issued
For example, Government Regulation No.66, 2001 on “Local Taxes” was only issued on the 13th of September 2001
However, local governments have started to prepare to formulate new local regulations on taxes
For example, Kabupaten Garut, before the end of 2001 had already ratified three new regulations on taxes, namely, a swallows nests tax, television tax and a parking tax
The tax on swallows nests and televisions are both additional taxes formulated by the Kabupaten Garut Government outside of the seven types of taxes which are outlined in Law No 34, 2000
Even though the several criteria on the taxes which can be stipulated by the local government have been outlined in Law No 34, 2000, these criteria are still extremely general
Consequently, it is very easy for the local governments to formulate various local regulations on taxes which do not contravene the stipulations outlined in the Law
In a number of regions (outside of the research area), there seems to be a tendency for the local governments to create additional taxes on goods and services, which are generally linked to farming or trade
Four taxes of this sort have been included in a list of local regulations which are being considered to be revoked by the Minister of Finance
These taxes on traded goods and services are being considered to be abolished because if a low level government administration imposes such taxes, it is thought that the flow of economic resources between regions and export import activities will be hampered
Article 80, Clause (2) of Government Regulation No 65, 2001 on “Local Taxes” states that if in any instance regulations are in opposition to the public interest and/or a higher level of government regulation, the Minister of Home Affairs after consultation with the Minister of Finance may revoke the local regulations in question
This supervisory function is definitely required, yet, it would seem that the central government would find it difficult to monitor 32 provinces and 341 kabupaten and kota
Supposing that each region was to formulate 10 local regulations every year, there would be (341+32) x 10 local regulations which would have to be examined by the central government each year
In the past, monitoring systems of this nature have often opened up the opportunity for ‘rogue elements' of the central government to collect unofficial fees from the regions
In addition, there is a current tendency for the regions to reject various forms of central government supervision, because they feel that in practice, the central government's supervisory role tends to interfere with the regions' authority, and therefore is not in accordance with the basic values of regional autonomy and decentralization
To create a more efficient and reliable method of supervision over the implementation of additional local regulations, the community, both individuals and organizations, such as the press, NGOs, academics and business groups need to take a larger role in the monitoring process
In order for this to happen the community needs to be strengthened and made aware that they also have a responsibility to play a role in the formulation of public policies, rather than just waiting to become the next target of these policies
5
One region's regulations can be detrimental for another region
Rattan craftsmen from Cirebon are starting to suspect that the diminishing supplies of unprocessed rattan from Sulawesi and Kalimantan is a result of the implementation of regional autonomy
They have stated that because the local governments in the rattan producing areas are now permitting the export of unprocessed rattan, the supply of rattan to Cirebon is diminishing
V
CONCLUSION 
Free trade and regional autonomy
The free movement of goods and services can increase economic efficiency and have positive benefits for both producers and consumers
Free domestic trade also supports national interests by increasing international competition, and promoting the national economy as a unifying force within the country
Meanwhile, decentralization and the regional autonomy policy are basically in line with free domestic trade
The main objective of this policy is to make government services accessible to the community, by promoting efficiency and accountability through the involvement of the wider community
However, in order to ensure that the local governments provide these improved public services, they require funding
Regional revenue is one source of funding which is controlled by local governments as autonomous administrations
The Relationship between the provincial government and the kabupaten and kota governments
During the initial stages of implementing decentralization and regional autonomy, the provincial government's authority tended to decrease in relation to the kabupaten and kota governments
As yet, Government Regulation No 20, 2001 on “Guidance and Supervision of Local Government Administrations” has not been fully implemented
A barrier to its full implementation is one of the clauses in Law No.22, 1999 which states that each autonomous region stands alone, and has no hierachical relationship with any other government in the region
There is a tendency for kabupaten and kota governments to formulate regulations without considering the effects these regulations will have on another kabupaten or kota
Both the provincial governments as well as the kabupaten and kota governments can impose local charges on the same target
The procedures and criteria used to obtain licenses are both costly and time consuming
Local regulations on licensing can often have a negative impact on the business climate because there are often a significant number of complex requirements which need to be fulfilled to obtain certain licenses
In order to obtain all the required documents to start the licensing process, the applicant must pay quite a large sum of money (for both official and unofficial charges), and set a side a significant amount of time
When the required documents have been obtained, the applicant must be prepared for additional costs and more time consuming procedures
The Relationship between the General Allocation of Funds, local revenue and the business climate
All regions whether they are receiving a large or a small amount of funding from the General Allocation of Funds, make every effort to increase their local revenue
Several regions have done this by issuing new local regulations on taxes and levies and/or by updating the local regulations which already exist
Regional government officials consider this necessary for regulating the implementation of regional autonomy which requires funds to improve public services
However, business people are beginning to see that this tendency will gradually suppress the business climate, and eventually obstruct any efforts to make the economy more efficient
For example, the West Java Association of Plantation Businesses has sent a letter to the Governor complaining about the taxes and levies imposed in several kabupaten in West Java which have increased production costs without adding value to their plantation produce
It is not only business people who are worried about these conditions, but also international organizations
For example, at the end of 2001, the IMF recommended that the government immediately revoke approximately 100 local regulations in various regions throughout Indonesia
Problems with the concept of taxes, levies, fees and contributions
Recently, several parties have been concerned that the taxes and levies imposed on economic activities in the community are not being supported by government efforts to improve services
The local governments are aware that the payment of charges and fees should be translated as the provision of services for the community
However, the local governments realize they can not provide the services that are intended, therefore, they try to collect the funds in the form of tax
Indeed, taxes are not directly related to services, yet the community keeps demanding that the government provide services as a result of the taxes they are obliged to pay
For example, people living in settlements with no streetlights will be opposed to paying a public street light tax
From the procedural side of regulatory legislation, it would seem easier to collect charges in the form of third party contributions
A number of local governments are trying to shift taxes and levies towards third party contributions, which in the local government budgets are classified as other revenue items
Kabupatens are demanding fiscal decentralization
Officials at the kabupaten level of government are starting to demand that this level of government be appointed or designated the task of collecting potential taxes and levies, including income tax, value-added tax, and taxes on motor vehicles
They are proposing that the central or provincial governments formulate regulations on the mechanisms used in the collection of taxes and levies, the size of the taxes and levies, the sanctions imposed, and the formula outlined to allocate the revenue
In theory, this will be extremely significant for the government in their efforts to reduce routine administrative expenses, especially office operating expenses and the cost of salaries
The potential influence of businesses on local government policy
Neither the Provincial Government of West Java nor the kabupaten and kota governments in the province have formulated local regulations implementing non-tariff barriers aimed at controlling the economy or the market
Several factory owners in the tea sector have tried to encourage the local government to create trading system regulations on the marketing of tea leaves, ensuring that certain local farmers only sell their produce to factories in their own area
Previously in West Java, zones were set up for the marketing of tea, but in practice, these marketing zones caused the price of tea at the level of the producer to decline
If the negative effects of decentralization and the implementation of regional autonomy are not rectified, they will eventually become a source of conflict amongst government administrations, both vertically and horizontally, as well as local governments and community groups
Presently, with decentralization and the implementation of regional autonomy there is a tendency for community interests to be pushed aside, especially those related to the investment climate and trade
indeed need to be monitored and evaluated by various parties, including the local governments themselves
In order to provide more opportunities for community involvement, a program needs to be developed to strengthen the potential of the community
Social Security Reform in Indonesia
An Analysis of the National Social Security Bill (RUU Jamsosnas)
Abstract 
The Indonesian social security program is currently undergoing a fundamental overhaul designed to make the existing system work better for the beneficiaries and to extend social security coverage to more workers, both in the formal and informal sector
The existing scheme has not been successful in its aims to provide adequate social security benefits to beneficiaries because of its low coverage, limited benefits, and low investment returns, combined with poor governance
The government has proposed a plan to convert the current social security scheme, which is based on a provident fund system, into a compulsory social insurance system
The plan is analyzed in this paper in order to examine the possible impact of the proposed scheme on the Indonesian labor market, investment flows, the government budget, and the economy in general
From this analysis, we can conclude that there are several serious flaws in the government proposal as outlined in the proposed legislation, such as
the proposed scheme could worsen Indonesia's labor market and investment climate, worsen the government's budget deficits, and does not provide room for the private sector to provide social security benefits to Indonesians
Many have concluded that publicly-provided social security schemes are no longer a viable model for workers today 
Given the many problems facing the Indonesian public pension and healthcare system today, Indonesia should seriously consider adopting private social security programs to replace the current publiclyprovided scheme

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Indonesian government has completed a draft law on the reform of the National Social Security System (also known as Jamsosnas) and it is expected to be approved by the Indonesian Parliament (DPR) later this year
It will replace the existing social security schemes (Askes, Jamsostek, Taspen, and Asabri) that have not been successful in providing adequate benefits to their beneficiaries due to their low level of enrollment, inadequate benefits for participants, and poor governance
The scheme proposed by the government is very comprehensive, consisting of an oldage pension, National Health Insurance (NHI), death benefits, and worker disability schemes
It will cover all Indonesian citizens, regardless of whether they are formal workers, informal workers, or self-employed
The old-age pension program is a defined benefit social insurance program which will operate under a pay-as-you-go system
The defined benefit of this program is a percentage of an individual's average income from the previous year, between a minimum of 60% and maximum of 80% of the local minimum wage (UMR)
Each worker will receive a guaranteed minimum pension of at least 70% of the UMR
The NHI program is designed to provide comprehensive health benefits ranging from benefits for preventative treatments, such as immunization and family planning, to those which cover catastrophic illnesses, such as heart and kidney diseases
Both public and private health providers would be able to deliver these services, as long as they sign a service contract with the government
The cost of funding the National Social Security Program would be quite substantial for formal employers and workers who are obliged to make contributions to the scheme in order to receive its benefits
For the NHI program, formal sector workers must pay a 6% payroll tax on their gross income, which would be split equally with employers
Exact contributions from self-employed and informal sector workers will be decided at a later date, 
as is the case for the contribution rate for the public pension program
However, it is estimated that the total amount of combined payroll taxes that will have to be paid by formal sector employers and workers will be between 18% to 20% of worker's payroll
Thus, the Jamsosnas scheme could create a substantial burden for formal employers and workers, as they will be the ones responsible for paying for these schemes
The Jamsosnas bill could make Indonesian businesses even less competitive, since it creates substantial new labor costs for companies
Employers could respond to this law by reducing their workers salaries to cover the required payroll taxes, thus reducing take-home-pay for workers
They could also reduce the number of workers they employ in order to reduce their business expenses
This could reduce the income of low-middle income workers, who are more likely to fall into poverty as a result of being laid off
Additionally, there are no known actuarial calculations that serve as a sound basis for determining the contribution levels and the payouts of this scheme, 
nor have there been any reliable econometric analyses on the short and long-term impacts of this scheme on the labor market, the competitiveness of Indonesian businesses, and the Indonesian economy in general
Without such analyses, the impact of this scheme on the economy remains questionable and the adequacy of the proposed contribution rates in paying actual program benefits remains doubtful
The government's plan to subsidize the coverage of low-income persons is also questionable
According to the draft law, Indonesians whose income falls below the UMR will be considered as low-income earners and will therefore be eligible to receive the government subsidy
However, there is a substantial number of Indonesians whose incomes are below the UMR rate, especially those who live in rural areas
If there were too many Indonesians eligible to receive this subsidy, the central government budget could run into a deficit, thus casting doubts on the long-term sustainability of the national social security program
The scheme also fails to address the problem of the rapidly aging population estimated to begin in the next few decades
Demographic estimates have shown that the Indonesian population aged 55 years and older will rise dramatically in the next few decades, from about 10% of the total population in 2000 to about 30% of the total population in 2050
The combination of a relatively low minimum retirement age (55 years), low minimum working years to qualify for pension (15 years) and a rapidly aging population is a recipe for disaster for any public pension program, 
and it seems that this proposed scheme will suffer from such a fate
Additionally, most of the costs incurred by the NHI scheme would be generated by the elderly
If there are insufficient funds available in the National Health Trust Fund to pay for their care, the NHI scheme could run into serious financial problems
Also, there is no requirement for service providers to provide health services to all NHI participants who wish to seek treatment in their facilities
Thus, some providers might choose not to sign contracts with the government and therefore not accept patients covered solely by the NHI scheme
If the above assumption were proven correct, both the choice and the quality of treatment available to patients would be severely limited
Finally, the scheme disregards the role of competition in providing social security benefits for Indonesians, since according to the bill, social security provision would become the sole responsibility of the government, 
in spite of the fact that most formal sector workers already have adequate health and retirement benefits from their employers
As a result of this monopoly, workers might lose their privately provided health and retirement coverage that might offer better benefits than the Jamsosnas scheme
Experiences from other countries in the world (especially Europe and Latin America) that have comprehensive social security schemes for their citizens show that publiclyfunded social security schemes have often failed due to problems relating to demographic transition, benefit levels that were too generous, not being financially sustainable, and often, poor governance
Many of these countries (such as Chile, Mexico, Poland, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Australia) have pursued other alternatives in providing social security for their citizens, specifically, by reforming their public social security programs
Based on these experiences, the provision and financing of social security programs should no longer be the sole responsibility of the government
In the above countries, it has been proven that the private sector can play a positive role in providing comprehensive social security coverage for citizens
This can be achieved through improving the quality of social security services available to the public, introducing competition in the provision of social security programs, and eventually, improving age and health indicators in these countries
Based on these facts, policymakers should revise the Jamsosnas bill significantly so that it does not create an additional burden for workers and businesses, is financially sustainable, provides adequate benefits to its participants, and promotes the involvement of the private sector in providing the social security coverage to the general public, through individual retirement and medical savings accounts schemes
This should be conducted under the three-pillar paradigm, which has been adopted in various countries, both developed and developing
The role of the government would be limited to issuing and enforcing appropriate regulations to safeguard the workers' social security savings 
and to provide publicly funded social assistance (funded through general tax revenue) to the poorest Indonesians who are no longer able to work (e.g., the elderly and the permanently disabled)
I INTRODUCTION 
Indonesia is in the middle of reforming its existing social security system, in order to make the existing system work better for beneficiaries, increase its benefits, and extend its coverage to more workers, both in the formal and informal sectors
Reforming the system is essential in improving the welfare of all Indonesians
With this in mind, Indonesia should choose a reform scheme that maximizes the welfare of all Indonesians, does not create an additional burden for workers and businesses, is financially sustainable, and gives greater autonomy to workers to have a voice in managing their own social security funds
First, this paper will describe the current national social security system (Jamsostek) and its weaknesses that have caused the scheme to be less than effective in providing social security for Indonesians
Then, the draft of the government's pension reform plan, detailed in the Indonesian Social Security Law and currently being discussed in the Indonesian Parliament (DPR), will be analyzed
Finally, the paper will conclude with several policy recommendations and alternatives to this proposed reform scheme
II THE CURRENT INDONESIAN SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM 
2.1 Current Public Pension Programs in Indonesia Currently, only about 10% of all Indonesians (both workers and their families) have some form of pension coverage, either from publicly-funded pension schemes or private ones (mostly sponsored by large state-owned enterprises and multinational corporations) (ILO)
There are several public pension programs that are sponsored and administered by the government at this time
The two largest programs are the Jamsostek program for private sector workers in the formal sector and the Taspen program for current and retired civil servants and their families
2.1.1 The Jamsostek Provident Fund Scheme 
According to the Indonesian Social Security Law (Law No 3/1992), there are four different social security schemes in Indonesia including
(1) worker injury benefits; (2) death benefits; (3) retirement benefits; and (4) healthcare benefits
The law stipulates that the premiums for worker injury, death, and healthcare benefits are paid entirely by employers, while the retirement benefit premiums are shared by both employers and workers
Worker injury, death, and retirement benefits are invested in a provident fund managed entirely by a state-owned company, PT Jamsostek, while the healthcare program can be contracted out to a private provider if it can be shown that the benefits would be either similar or surpass the benefits provided by PT Jamsostek (ILO, 93)
Table 1 shows the specific social security premiums that have to be paid by both employers and workers
Each employer has to make a contribution of between 7.24 and 11.24% of the total wages paid to their workers
This amount is equal to about one month of a worker's annual salary
In addition, each worker has to contribute 2% of their wages to the retirement benefits program
The Jamsostek program is currently undergoing fundamental reform, which is being undertaken to fix structural problems
The existing social security system has failed to prevent those affected by the Indonesian economic crisis from falling below the poverty line
This is because in many ways the current system is inadequate
First, it does not cover informal sector workers, individuals who are self-employed, and formal sector workers who are employed by small businesses (with 10 employees or less)
This means that the vast majority of Indonesian workers (80% of the total workforce) are not covered by this scheme
In addition, it is also estimated that only about half of the employers required by the Indonesian Social Security Law to make contributions to the scheme are actually making contributions (ILO, 63)
Thus, the number of workers that are actually covered by the Jamsostek program is abysmally low
Additionally, Jamsostek does not create adequate incentives for its members to save for retirement because the benefits received by those who make contributions to Jamsostek are very small
A World Bank study done by Leechor estimates that the total pension payments received by a Jamsostek recipient at retirement is only valued at about 7% of their final basic salary after 35 years of active work (36), while another study conducted by the International Labor Organization (ILO) found that the average value of a Jamsostek pension only amounts to five and a half months of their basic salary or eight and a half months of the current minimum wage (UMR) (ILO, 90)
It has been concluded that these workers would earn a better rate of return on their investments if they put their retirement savings into a bank account rather than the Jamsostek scheme
In addition, the rate of return on investments in the Jamsostek fund is also very low
The ILO found that income from such investments is valued cumulatively at 38% below the level of inflation and 63% less than the average market rate (ILO, 94)
This is caused by the fact that the Jamsostek fund is invested mostly in banks 80% in 1997 and 86% in June 1999 (Perwira et.al.)
While such an investment is considered relatively safe, in the long run, it earns less than other investment schemes, such as those invested in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds
Finally, critics have argued that the management of the Jamsostek fund has not been open and transparent
For instance, it has been found that PT Jamsostek as the sole provider of publicly-funded retirement benefits in Indonesia has failed to provide financial statements and regular progress reports that can be accessed by workers participating in the scheme and the general public (Leechor, 39)
When we look at the level of benefits received by workers covered by Jamsostek, combined with the low return on investment and lack of transparency, it is no wonder that most Indonesian employers and employees have little faith in the scheme providing social protection for them
The fact that only about half of all employers who are required to participate in the Jamsostek scheme are making contributions to the scheme is testament to the low confidence of employers and employees in the scheme as they instead choose to provide these benefits through the private sector
2.1.2 The Taspen Program for Civil Servants 
The Taspen (Social Insurance and Retirement Savings for Civil Servants) scheme was created in 1963 to provide retirement benefits, death benefits, and retirement savings by providing both a lump sum and monthly pensions for participants or their inheritors
It is hoped that this benefit can provide financial support for members after retirement
This scheme was expanded to include special pension schemes for elderly members, their inheritors, and members who are disabled based upon Government Regulation No 25/1981 on Social Insurance for Civil Servants
All members of the Taspen scheme are Indonesian civil servants, which is defined as those who are employed as civil servants by either a government official or a government agency, and are paid regular salaries according to the prevailing civil servant salary schedule based upon the central and local government's budget
Members of the armed forces and the police force are covered under a separate pension scheme called Asabri (Social Insurance for Members of the Armed Forces), which was created on August 1, 1971
Since then, they have not been eligible to receive Taspen benefits
The civil servants retirement benefits scheme managed by PT Taspen consists of an old-age savings scheme and a pension scheme
Government Regulation No 25/1981 describes these schemes in the following ways
The old-age savings scheme is an insurance program, consisting of a compulsory savings scheme and death benefits for members and their immediate families
The pension scheme provides an income to members on a monthly basis, which is set according to the prevailing laws and regulations
It is given to civil servants and/or their immediate families who met the following criteria
- Has reached retirement age (currently 56 years)
- If they died while serving as civil servants, the pension will be given to their spouses or children
- If they died after retiring from the civil service, the pension will be given to their spouses or their children who have not reached 25 years of age
Monthly pension benefits for members amount to 2.5% of their basic salary multiplied by the number of years they served in the civil service
This scheme is mainly funded by the national budget (APBN) but is also funded by contributions from members, which amount to 4.75% of their base salaries
At present, there are approximately four million civil servants and they contribute up about 8% of the funds for PT Taspen's programs
PT Taspen contributes about 22.5% of the overall expenses, derived from its enormous assets and investment income from member contributions
The rest of the expenses (69.5%) are paid for by the government budget (ILO)
However, given the recent increase in civil servant salaries and pension benefits, it is estimated that the Taspen scheme will not be sustainable in the long run
Leechor has predicted that the funds available to pay the full pension benefits of all civil servants will run into a deficit starting in 2006 and without changes in contribution rates, it might become insolvent by 2015 (29)
PT Taspen's financial state has been made worse by the existing laws that restrict the government from providing advanced funding for the Taspen scheme
It is estimated that to fully fund the Taspen pension scheme, an additional 3.25% of civil servants basic salaries is required
Furthermore, the total contribution from the government for the Taspen pension scheme would be about 66% of the central government's routine budget by 2020
This would certainly have a serious impact on the government's fiscal position (Leechor, 29-30)
Compared to the Jamsostek scheme, Taspen's pension fund provides more benefits for its member, because the value of pensions for members is estimated at 100% of their final salaries after 35 years in the civil service, a rate that is much better than Jamsostek pensions, which only amount to around 11% of members final salaries after 35 years of work (Leechor, 24)
This generous pension benefit was decided upon because the official salaries of Indonesian civil servants are very low
However, the difference in pension benefits has resulted in the perception that the government takes care of its employees when they retired, whereas it does not pay enough attention to the general public
2.2 Current Public Health Insurance Schemes in Indonesia According to the 2003 ILO study, only 15% of Indonesians are currently covered by some form of health insurance scheme provided either by the public or private sector
There are three major categories of government-sponsored health insurance
insurance for civil servants and army personnel (Askes), insurance for formal private sector workers (Jamsostek), and community health funds and the Community Health Maintenance Organizations (JPKM)
2.2.1 The Askes Insurance Scheme 
About half of the insured Indonesians (around 7% of the population) receive their health insurance through PT Askes, a state-owned enterprise that administers health insurance for civil servants, retired civil servants, army personnel and their dependents
The Askes program is funded through a 2% payroll deduction from civil servants salaries
Payments are based on the capitation system, budgeting system and benefits package that are consistent with community health maintenance principles
Health services are provided through a health maintenance organization (HMO) network that is structured to provide promotive, preventive, curative, and rehabilitative treatments
However, PT Askes feels that the 2% premium is too low and affects the quality of health services for the program's beneficiaries
Hospitals and clinics that become service providers for PT Askes pay for a large portion of the health services provided because the Askes program only reimburses a small amount for the services provided for Askes beneficiaries
Even government subsidies to help these hospitals and clinics treat Askes beneficiaries do not cover all expenses
As a result, the number of services provided for Askes beneficiaries are often quite limited
For instance, most low-ranking civil servants receive the lowest level of inpatient care available (1D class) and it is very difficult for them to obtain access to a good referral system (Perwira et al.) 
2.2.2 The Jamsostek Health Insurance Scheme 
Another 1.3% of Indonesians receive their health insurance from a plan sponsored by PT Jamsostek (another state-owned company) which provides insurance for formal private sector workers
The premium for this scheme is 3% for single employees and 6% for employees who are married
Employers are fully responsible for paying this premium
The benefits are provided to employees, their spouse, and their children under the age of 21 years (up to the third child)
In 2000, only about 2.7 million Indonesians were covered by the PT Jamsostek health scheme
This number is quite small given the program's potential, because it is estimated that there are about 100 million people (workers and their families) who could be covered under the Jamsostek law (Law No 3/1992) (ILO, 207)
One cause of the low number of workers registering with PT Jamsostek's health plan is the existence of an opt-out clause that allows companies to join private health insurance schemes provided that the private scheme provides greater benefits than PT Jamsostek's plan
As a result, larger employers tend to opt out of the Jamsostek health scheme altogether and seek private health insurance for their employees
Only small employers with an average of 79 employees participate in the Jamsostek health insurance program
Another cause of the low number is the high level of noncompliance and evasion by companies participating in the Jamsostek program (ILO, 207)
PT Jamsostek subcontracts the provision of healthcare to other parties called main providers
Many of these parties are JPKM providers (or badan pelaksana as they are called in Indonesia) which are insurance carriers, not healthcare providers
Payments to providers (hospitals, doctors and midwives) are not made directly by Jamsostek, but instead are made on a capitation basis to the main providers
This system could lead to inefficiencies and higher costs, as main providers will take a portion of these payments as profits rather than channeling 100% toward actual health services
In addition, since many main providers do not actually own their own health services, they often subcontract health services to third-party providers, 
leading to higher administrative expenses
It is estimated that about 40% of Jamsostek health insurance contributions are used to cover various administrative costs, which means that a less than substantial amount actually goes to health provisions
Finally, PT Jamsostek has no standard procedure for the selection of main providers
This could lead to abuse by Jamsostek officials in the form of corruption, collusion, and nepotism in the selection of main providers (ILO, 208-209)
Because most health providers in Indonesia are still operating on a fee-for-service basis and capitation-based payments are not common, most providers (both hospitals and doctors) do not want to sign a contract with PT Jamsostek and therefore do not accept Jamsostek health insurance patients
As a result, the actual benefits of this insurance scheme are limited since the choice of providers available to members is limited
In addition, there are a limited number of services covered by the Jamsostek health insurance program
Inpatient services are limited to a maximum of 60 days, with a limit of 20 days for intensive care services
The plan does not cover treatment for various catastrophic illnesses, such as kidney dialysis, cancer treatment, cardiac surgery, and organ transplants; treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, alcoholism, and drug abuse; or any service provided by non-contracted providers (ILO, 209, 211)
In conclusion, the Jamsostek health insurance program has not been successful in attaining its goal to cover all private sector workers in Indonesia
Given the limited number of providers willing to accept the scheme, the lack of health benefits offered, and high administrative costs, it is no wonder that most employers and workers chose to opt out of the Jamsostek scheme and instead choose other private health insurance plans that provide greater benefits
2.2.3 The Community Health Fund and Community Health Maintenance (JPKM) Scheme 
The community health schemes in Indonesia began in the 1970s when the government introduced the village health fund (dana sehat)
This fund was set up to substitute the decline in the central government's health sector allocation after the fall in oil revenues in the mid 1970s
Their goal is to make local communities selfsufficient and self-reliant in financing their basic health provisions (ILO, 194)
In practice, however, few people contribute to community health schemes
It is estimated that in 1998, only 1.87% of the population were members of community health funds
Even when contributions to community health funds are supposed to be compulsory, many people simply choose not to contribute to the fund and, moreover, enforcement is lax
Factors that are attributed to low enrollment are the low cost of treatment in public health centers (so there is no incentive to join a community health scheme)
Moreover, the high level of financial assistance were given to poor communities to meet healthcare expenses, especially after the 1997/98 economic crisis
Contributions from health fund members are very low, which has resulted in the fund being insufficient to cover even basic health treatments
Community health schemes also suffer from a high dropout rate (it is estimated that around 90% of participants dropout in the first or second year) Contributions are not collected based on sound actuarial principles and funds are often managed by local government officials with little knowledge of healthcare financing
As a result, community health funds are vulnerable to corruption, collusion and nepotism (ILO,195)
Beside community health funds, the government also encouraged the development of JPKMs, which were modeled on HMOs in the United States
JPKMs were developed based on Law No 23/1992 and were regulated by the Ministry of Health
They were promoted extensively after the 1997/98 economic crisis
Financial incentives were given to insurance companies, cooperatives, and foundations to establish HMOs in each district
Within months, 354 HMOs had been created, 
mostly by civil servants, civil servant retirees, or cooperatives
They often did not have experience in managing such schemes, which could have lead to mismanagement
After much criticism and seeing that it was obvious that many of the HMOs would ultimately fail, the government stopped the program after only one year
There were never more than 100,000 members in the JPKM plans (ILO, 195, 203)
We can conclude that the government's efforts to create a community health scheme for the poor so far have been unsuccessful due to the lack of benefits, low cost of treatment at health centers, an unwillingness to contribute to the schemes, and poor management of the various health schemes
III THE PROPOSED INDONESIAN NATIONAL SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM BILL (RUU JAMSOSNAS) 
3.1 An Overview of the Draft Bill 
According to the Government of Indonesia's Academic Paper on the National Social Security System (GOI, Academic Paper) the new Indonesian national social security system will be established in accordance with the three-pillar approach recommended by the International Labor Organization (ILO)
The first pillar is social assistance for citizens who lack the financial means or access to services to meet their basic needs
This assistance is given to people who are genuinely in need, in the event of natural disasters, social unrest, illness, old age, or loss of employment
It will be financed by the state budget and/or by community (public) funds
The second pillar is a compulsory social insurance scheme, financed by contributions paid by both employers and employees
A person's contribution is related to their income or wage and is based upon society's current minimum standards of living
The third pillar is voluntary private insurance, in which a person may opt to take out additional insurance
The contribution paid by participants varies according to their own risk levels (GOI, Academic Paper 5-6)
The Jamsosnas scheme will be run based on the following principles
- Mutual assistance (gotong royong)
wealthier participants will assist those who are less fortunate, those with low risks will help those with high risks, and those who are healthier will help those who are sicker; - Compulsory membership
all Indonesian residents, in stages, will be required to participate in the Jamsosnas scheme; - Trust funds
the funds collected from participants will be managed by the National Social Security Provider Agencies in a trust fund which will be used optimally for the welfare of all participants; - Not-for-profit
the management of this trust fund should not be profit oriented and the funds should be used to meet the needs of all participants; - Openness, risk aversion, accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness
these management principles will become the basis for the national social security program; - Portability
participants will continue as members of the national social security scheme regardless of their income and employment status, and will continue to receive benefits regardless of their income and their position in the family, as long as they fulfill the eligibility criteria for receiving these benefits
The scheme proposed by the government is comprehensive and will consist of retirement benefits, healthcare benefits, death benefits, and worker disability benefits
Unlike Jamsostek, which only covers formal private sector workers, Jamsosnas will cover all Indonesian citizens, regardless of whether they are formal workers, informal workers, or self-employed
While the official contribution rates for the different Jamsosnas schemes are still unknown, we could estimate the rates for the Jamsosnas pension and death benefits programs based upon the current rates in the Jamsostek scheme, assuming that that they will not be much different from the existing contribution rates
The contribution rate for the retirement benefits program is estimated to be around 10.75% of one's base salary
4.75% for the old-age pension program (the current contribution rate for the Taspen pension scheme) and 6% for the old-age savings program (the current contribution rate for the Jamsostek provident fund)
Contributions will be shared equally by employers and workers
Finally, the death benefit program is estimated to be the same as the Jamsosnas death benefit scheme (currently 0.3% of one's base salary)
From these figures, we can estimate the total cost of the Jamsosnas program (for formal sector workers) will be between 17.29% to 18.80% of a formal sector worker's base salary (see Table 2 below)
3.2 Institutional Information A National Social Security Board will be set up to oversee the program
It will consist of 15 members, including five representatives from central government ministries and agencies (Ministries of Health, Manpower, Social Affairs, Social Welfare, and Finance), five from employers associations (Indonesian Employers Association - Apindo, Indonesian Chamber of Commerce - Kadin, etc.), and five from labor unions
The members will be appointed for a term of three years, which may be renewed for an additional three years (GOI, Academic Paper 16-17; GOI Draft sec 64)
The National Social Security Provider Agencies will manage the Social Security funds on a day-to-day basis
Responsibilities of these agencies will include ensuring workers make monthly contributions to the national social security fund, issuing social security identification numbers to every citizen in Indonesia, and managing the national social security fund
The management of these agencies will be appointed through shareholder meetings (GOI, Draft sec 49)
The National Social Security Agencies will consist of the different social security agencies
PT Jamsostek (which will manage the pension and health insurance programs for formal private sector employees), PT Askes (which will manage health insurance for civil servants), PT Taspen (which will manage the pension program for civil servants) and PT Asabri (which will manage the pension program for those in the armed forces)
These institutions will continue to operate their respective programs, without causing any losses for existing participants in their schemes
These institutions will remain for-profit state-owned enterprises (persero)
However, the bill drafters stated that these companies will receive a special status as special perseros (persero khusus), whereby they will be obliged to run the National Social Security programs on a not-for-profit basis and their social security revenues will not be subject to income tax payments (GOI, Draft sec 40- 41)
In reality, having persero and persero khusus legal status at the same time would be contradictory and many legal experts have questioned whether this arrangement would work
In addition to the four existing social security companies, a new company will be created to handle programs for informal sector workers and recipients of the government's social assistance schemes (GOI, Draft sec 78)
In accordance to the regional autonomy policy that was implemented in Indonesia in 2001, the regions will be responsible for administering the National Social Security Program within their own regions through the branch offices of the National Social Security Provider Agencies
Responsibilities delegated to the regions will include collecting contributions, distributing benefits to participants, issuing service contracts to health service providers, and designing a fee schedule for the different services provided by health service providers (GOI, Academic Paper 20, 34)
As not all regions will be ready to administer the National Social Security Program at the same time, the scheme will be implemented gradually in the regions, depending on their readiness to administer the program within their localities
Different social security programs will be introduced at different times depending on the needs and readiness of local governments
For instance, the health insurance program will be introduced before the old-age pension program (GOI, Academic Paper 33)
3.3 A Description of the Public Pension Programs 
The public pension program will comprise of two components in Indonesia
the public pension program and the old-age savings program
Each of these programs will be discussed below
3.3.1 The Old-Age Pension Program 
The old-age pension program is a long-term program where participants make regular contributions so that an additional income is available to offset a reduction in or loss of income after retirement
It is a defined-benefit social insurance program, and it will presumably operate as a partially funded pay-as-you-go scheme
As stipulated in the draft law, this program will only accumulate social security contributions for the first 15 years, and will only start paying pension benefits to retirees after this (GOI, Draft sec 34)
This old-age pension scheme has similar features to the publicly-run pension programs established in most developed countries in Western Europe and North America, and to the monthly pension program run by PT Taspen for retired civil servants and their widows/widowers
The program will be further divided into four components
old-age pensions, disability pensions, widow/widower pensions, and child pensions, (GOI, Draft sec 34)
The defined benefit of the old-age pension should normally be a percentage of the average income from the previous year
The fixed minimum pension under the proposed plan has been set at 70% of the minimum wage
The same benefit level also applies to the disability pension program
Widows/widowers and children will receive a minimum pension of between 40% and 60% of the local minimum wage (GOI, Academic Paper 59-60)
Widows/widows will continue to receive pension benefits until they die, remarry, or start working full-time
Children will continue to receive pension benefits until they marry, start working full-time, or reach 23 years of age, whichever comes first (GOI, Draft sec 34)
According to the draft academic paper, the contribution level for the pension program will be set differently for formal sector workers and informal sector workers
The paper stipulates that contributions from formal sector workers will be shared with their employers on a 50:50 basis
Employers will be responsible for collecting worker contributions and submitting them to the National Social Security Provider Agency
Informal workers and those who are self-employed will contribute a flat-rate amount to be determined later
The government plans to cover pensions for those who are too poor to contribute to the scheme through subsidies from the state budget (GOI, Academic Paper 22; GOI, Draft sec 7, subsec 5)
The retirement age is currently 55, and a worker who has contributed to the scheme for at least fifteen years will be entitled to receive full pension benefits from the program
These workers, or inheritors if a worker dies before reaching retirement age, will receive monthly pension payments
Workers that retire before reaching the fifteen years contribution requirement above, will be entitled to receive the accumulated amount of their pension contributions, plus the investment returns, in a lump sum
However, they will not be eligible to receive a monthly pension (GOI, Academic Paper 56; GOI, Draft sec 34)
3.3.2 The Old-Age Savings Program 
The old-age savings program is a long-term program in which participants will be entitled to receive benefits before or upon reaching retirement age and, in the event of the death of a participant, his or her spouse, children, or official inheritors will be entitled to receive benefits
It will be a compulsory savings program
Thus, it will be similar to the compulsory savings program run by PT Jamsostek for private formal sector workers and their families
In other words, it is a fully-funded, defined contribution pension program similar to the mandatory individual retirement account schemes in countries that have adopted the second pillar recommended by the World Bank (World Bank), with one important exception
according to the draft bill, this pension scheme will be run by a public social security agency instead of private investment companies
The benefits of this pension plan will be provided as a lump-sum payment if a worker dies, becomes permanently disabled, or retires
If a worker dies or becomes permanently disabled, benefits will go to their inheritors (spouses and children under the age of 23)
The total amount of program benefits received by members is the entire amount of their contribution accumulated over the years plus the investment returns on their contribution
At the earliest, workers may start withdrawing money from their account five years before they reach retirement age
They may even use a portion of the money saved in their account as a loan after they have made contributions for a given period of time, the details of which will be stipulated in a future government regulation (GOI, Draft sec 30)
Each member must contribute either a percentage of their income (formal workers) or a flat-rate amount (informal and self-employed workers) to this savings program
Contributions from formal workers will be split equally between themselves and their employers
The National Social Security Provider Agency will be required to provide an annual report to each worker on their accumulated contribution and investment returns
Exactly how the government plans to invest the funds collected by this scheme will be stipulated in a future government regulation (GOI, Draft sec 31)
3.4 The National Health Insurance Scheme 
As a part of national social security reform, the government plans to create a National Health Insurance (NHI) program that will theoretically cover health expenditures for all Indonesian residents
It is based on the principles of social justice, social assistance, and universal/compulsory participation (GOI, Academic Paper 27)
All Indonesian residents will have to contribute to this scheme, including upperincome Indonesians and foreigners working in Indonesia, groups that are presumably already a part of good health insurance schemes
The program will be implemented in stages, first for formal sector workers and then for informal and self-employed workers
Formal sector workers must pay a 6% payroll tax, split equally with their employers
Retirees will also pay the 6% tax and this will be deducted from their pension
Exact contributions from self-employed and informal sector workers will be decided on at a latter date
The government will pay contributions for those with a low income or who are unemployed (GOI, Academic Paper 41)
It is unclear whether this will be the responsibility of the central government or the local governments
The law defines low-income participants as those whose income is lower than the regional minimum wage (UMR) in the district where they live (GOI, Academic Paper 6)
The NHI program is designed to provide comprehensive health benefits, ranging from preventive treatments such as immunization and family planning to treatment for catastrophic illnesses such as heart and kidney diseases (GOI, Draft explanation to sec 13, subsection (1))
The law defines standard health services as primary health services, referral services, and other supporting health services
Primary health services are services that are provided through the government's health service facilities, and include general practitioners, dentists, medical facilities, mother and child health facilities, maternity hospitals, and other primary health facilities (provided by the private sector)
For in-patient services, the health benefit is equivalent to health services in class II private hospitals
Referral health services are health services provided by specialists, dentists, hospitals, and other specialist health service facilities
Finally, other health services include prescription drugs, laboratories, and other services (including prenatal-postnatal services) (GOI, Academic Paper 24)
The government plans to compensate providers using the capitation-based reimbursement system, mainly through the Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) scheme
Services will be delivered by both public and private hospitals and health clinics, as long as they agree to the terms of conditions stipulated in the service contracts they sign with the National Health Insurance Provider Agency (GOI, Academic Paper 40)
However, there is no requirement for service providers to provide health services to NHI participants seeking treatment in their facilities
Thus, some providers might choose not to sign contracts with the National Health Insurance Provider Agency and therefore not accept patients covered solely by the NHI scheme
The NHI program will be administered by the National Health Insurance Provider Agency, which will be supervised by the National Social Security Board
Its functions will include determining general policy regarding the implementation of the NHI program, selecting health service providers, and making payments directly or indirectly to health service providers for medical services provided to participants (GOI, Academic Paper 38)
The agency's management will be appointed for a period of five years at the agency's shareholders meetings (GOI, Draft sec 54)
In accordance with regional autonomy policy, the National Health Insurance Provider Agency will establish regional offices
These branches will be set up based on the readiness of the regions to administer the program, although the implementation of the NHI program in the regions will receive higher priority than the other Social Security Programs (GOI, Academic Paper 33)
Regional offices will have broad authorities in implementing the NHI program in their regions, including the authority to
1) determine the level of investment of social security funds in the regions; 2) issue service contracts to health service providers; and 3) create fee schedules which will determine the payments to health service providers for the services they provide (GOI, Academic Draft 34)
IV AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED INDONESIAN SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM BILL 
4.1 A General Analysis 
Based on the results of our analysis of the current National Social Security Reform draft bill (dated January 16, 2004), we can make the following conclusions
Actuarial calculations which provide a sound basis for determining contribution levels 
and the real benefits of the scheme have not been included in the draft law, 
and there have not been any reliable economic analyses on the short and long-term impact of this scheme on the labor market, Indonesia's business competitiveness, and the Indonesian economy in general
In the absence of such analyses, the impact of this scheme on the economy remains questionable 
and the adequacy of the proposed contribution rate in paying actual program benefits remains doubtful
The National Social Security Program (consisting of public pension, NHI, workplace injury, and death benefit schemes) would also become a significant financial burden for employers and workers, since they will be expected to contribute between 18% and 20% of workers wages, 
which would be a 5% to 7% increase from the current Jamsostek contribution rate
Thus, the Jamsosnas scheme could create a substantial burden for formal employers and workers and could further reduce the competitiveness of Indonesia's business climate, as it creates substantial new labor costs for companies
As a result, there could be significant incentives for employers to shift the cost of these contributions to workers by lowering their take-home pay and benefits and reducing the number of employees, which means that in practice, the total cost of paying for these schemes would be solely born by workers
This could reduce the income of low-middle income workers who rely on this salary
According to the Jamsosnas academic paper (GOI), contributions from formal sector workers will be set at a much higher rate than that from informal sector workers and the self-employed, since it is assumed that the payroll tax paid by the former group will subsidize the social security benefits of the latter groups
However, the draft bill does not clearly define or explain this cross-subsidization scheme
Thus, the new social security scheme would become less attractive for these workers 
and the incentives for evasion could be substantial (e.g., switching to the informal sector where the contribution rates are much lower)
It is also questionable as to whether workers who work in the formal sector (one third of Indonesian workers) can fully subsidize those in the informal sector
Experiences in other developing countries show that similar social security programs only cover a small proportion of the workforce
For instance, the Philippines has had a social security program for 45 years and whereas about 72% of the workforce are members of the pension program, only 28% of these workers actually pay their compulsory contributions (Capulong)
In addition, past attempts to collect social security contributions from informal sector workers, both in Indonesia and other developing countries, have shown that it is very difficult, if not impossible
This is because many informal workers are very mobile in terms of their place of work, the type of jobs they undertake, and where they live
Thus, trying to find a particular worker in the informal sector from one month to the next in order to collect their social security contribution is probably a futile exercise
As a result, many informal workers are not covered by any social security scheme, either because tax collectors cannot contact them or because they fail to claim the social security benefits they are entitled to, even though they have made some contribution to the scheme
As a result, informal sector workers continue to be excluded from publicly-sponsored social security schemes, despite many arguing that they are the ones who need social security protection the most
The program could also have significant managerial and governance problems
Even though the National Social Security Board will consist of representatives of the government, employers associations and workers, most of the board members will come from government ministries and agencies
Additionally, the proposal does not address the possibility of collusion and nepotism during the selection process, so the government could appoint private sector and labor representatives who support the interests of government bureaucrats
As a result, board members representing employers and workers might not necessarily work in the interests of these groups
The program will continue to be administered by several state-owned enterprises, which will be established as for-profit corporations and be obliged to contribute to the government's budget
Current social security schemes administered by for-profit state enterprises have failed to provide adequate benefits to beneficiaries because of the small number of people they cover, relatively small benefits, low investment returns, and poor governance
It is doubtful that the new social security scheme will be different from previous government programs if it is administered by the same state-owned enterprises without any fundamental change
Finally, the government's proposal disregards the role of competition in providing social security benefits to Indonesians, 
as according to the bill, the government will be solely responsible for social security provision, in spite of the fact that most formal sector workers already obtain adequate health and retirement benefits from their employers
The government alone will continue to make decisions on how the fund is managed, invested, and distributed among beneficiaries, while workers themselves will not be allowed to participate in the decision-making relating to the trust fund, even though it is actually their own money and most Indonesians workers have little confidence in publicly-run social security schemes
Evidence from other countries (notably Latin American and Eastern European countries) shows that entrusting the operation of the national social security system to the same party that regulates it (i.e., the government) simply does not work
The government-run social security programs in these countries are always prone to empty promises of generous benefits that the governments are not able to accomplish financially, and continued corruption and abuse of social security funds by officials
This indicates that it is not a good idea for the government to regulate as well as operate the national social security scheme
These functions need to be separated in order to have a truly functional social security system that is beneficial for workers
4.2 An Analysis of the Proposed Public Pension Scheme 
4.2.1 The Old-Age Pension Scheme 
The proposed Indonesian old-age pension scheme has been designed as a social insurance system, which will operate as a partially-funded, pay-as-you-go defined benefit program
It will be a compulsory, universal insurance program for all Indonesian residents, regardless of their nationality and working status
As a compulsory insurance program, the scheme will avoid the problem of adverse selection, since no one will be able to opt out of it and choose an alternative pension plan
However, it could suffer from moral hazards, in which workers might cut their savings because they believe they will receive pension benefits when they retire
Thus, overall welfare of workers could worsen with public social security since they may have little private savings to supplement their income from the public pension scheme
The defined benefit system adopted by the scheme would place significant financial risks on employers and the government, because they might have to be responsible for making additional contributions to the scheme in case it runs into serious financial problems
In the case of Indonesia, there is a high probability of the program running into deficit, because it will offer very generous pension benefits, with a minimum benefit of 70% of the local minimum wage
Since many Indonesian workers, especially those who work in the informal sector, have earnings below the local minimum wage, many of them will receive this guaranteed benefit
Due to the substantial liability, the possibility of serious financial problems in this pension scheme in the future is quite high
In addition, the fact that the benefits of the old-age pension scheme seem to be determined based upon the minimum wage could create additional demands from workers and labor unions for the government and employers to increase the minimum wage, so that workers can earn higher pension benefits
If the government was to give in to such pressures, it would incur additional pension liabilities in the future, something that could further endanger the government's fiscal position and sustainability in the future, 
when the time comes for the government to start paying pension benefits
In 2003 and 2004, the local minimum wage (UMR) increased between 10-15% on average
If this trend continues we can expect pension benefits and therefore costs to rise between 10-15%, whereas inflation would be around 6-7% per annum
In addition, the government's plan to subsidize the coverage of low-income persons is also questionable
According to the draft law, Indonesians whose income falls below the UMR will be considered as "low-income" earners and therefore will be eligible to receive a government subsidy to help cover their Jamsosnas contribution
However, there is a substantial number of Indonesians who earn less than the UMR, especially those who work in the informal sector or are not permanently employed
If there were too many Indonesians eligible to receive this subsidy, the government would have to commit significant resources to cover this subsidy
Consequently, this could put significant financial strain on the government budget
It is not clear whether the government plans to pay for this subsidy using general revenues or other channels such as surpluses generated by the investment of the National Social Security Trust Fund
It is also unclear how the government will allocate this subsidy to the recipients (direct payments to beneficiaries, payments to health providers, etc)
If this issue is not addressed, it could become another factor that could raise doubts over the long-term sustainability of the national social security program
In addition, the proposal seems to fail to take into account that the Indonesian population is aging rapidly
It is estimated that the proportion of Indonesians over 55 years will increase from about 10% of the population in the year 2000 (about 23 million) to about 30% by 2050 (about 100 million) (Indonesia)
At the same time, the Indonesian population aged 65 years and older will rise dramatically during this period, from 10 million in 2000 (4.5% of the population) to 60.5 million in 2050 (18% of the population) (Indonesia)
Thus, the elderly will be more of a burden to Indonesian families (and taxpayers) by the year 2050
The combination of a relatively young retirement age (55 years), low number of working years to qualify for pensions (15 years) and a rapidly aging population, is a recipe for disaster for any public pension program, and it seems that this proposed scheme will suffer from such a fate and become financially unsustainable
Attempts to correct the problem such as raising contributions and cutting pension benefits are only temporary fixes that will make the program less attractive to participants
Eventually, the pension scheme could suffer from a default, which would place significant financial liabilities on the government and employers as well as result in a significant loss of retirement income for workers
Experiences from other developing countries such as the Philippines show that the liabilities of social security pension funds could be substantial
In the Philippines, the number of new retirees eligible for pension benefits more than doubled in the 1990s
This caused the funds accumulated in the country's social security trust fund to decline significantly, so that it is now predicted that the fund will be completely depleted by the year 2015
If this occurs, the Philippines social security system will run into significant financial problems 
the hidden public pension debt is estimated to be about US$21 billion (Rp200 trillion) (Capulong)
We could predict that if the same situation occurs in Indonesia, which has a population about three times larger than the Philippines, the Indonesian government and eventually Indonesian citizens, would be obliged to pay a substantial number of new debts that could be up to three times larger than the debt incurred by the Philippines social security system (around US$ 63 billion or about Rp598 trillion)
Since Indonesia has a large amount of public debt (estimated at US$136 billion or around Rp1.292 trillion) as of March 2004 (Central Bank), this country cannot afford an extra Rp598 trillion in debt
Finally, it is estimated that the impact of the proposed Jamsosnas old-age pension scheme on the current Indonesian elderly population would be minimal
Since the system is a partially funded pay-as-you-go scheme, unless they make contributions, the current retirees will not benefit at all
Although it is the current poor retirees that need Jamsosnas old-age pension scheme the most, they do not have the financial resources to contribute to the scheme
People who retire between when the Jamsosnas pension scheme takes effect and when it will start paying pensions (about fifteen years after its establishment according to the draft law) will also not benefit from the Jamsosnas pension scheme
As stipulated in the draft law (GOI, Draft sec 34, subsection (5)), they will not be eligible to receive a pension
They will only receive the money accumulated in their old-age savings accounts (contribution plus investment earnings)
However, in general, only those who retire fifteen years after the Jamsosnas pension scheme has been in place and have made regular contributions to the scheme will receive pension benefits
Thus, unlike what has been claimed by the proponents of the Jamsosnas bill, the Jamsosnas pension scheme will not be very helpful for current retirees who do not have the resources to contribute to the scheme
However, this group is still vulnerable to old-age poverty, if not more so compared with future retirees that will have participated in the Jamsosnas pension scheme
Consequently, the government might have to establish a separate pension or income support scheme for this group
4.2.2 The Old-Age Savings Scheme 
Since the proposed old-age savings scheme is similar in many ways to the current Jamsostek provident fund scheme (both are fully funded, defined contribution schemes fully paid from workers contributions), we can look at the experiences of the Jamsostek scheme in anticipating the problems in the new old-age savings scheme
As stipulated in section II, the Jamsostek scheme suffers from a low participation rate, a low compliance rate, low investment returns, as well as poor governance and offers few benefits
These factors have significantly reduced the real value of the Jamsostek scheme as a possible source of income for its participants
Thus, many participants do not regard Jamsostek as a reliable source for their post retirement income
One lesson we could draw from Jamsostek is that without significantly reforming the financial and managerial governance of the current old-age savings program, it is unlikely that the performance, investment return, and benefits of the new scheme will improve significantly
This would make the proposed old-age savings scheme unattractive to participants and, like with Jamsostek today, they would not regard it as a potential source of their old age income and would continue to rely on private voluntary savings schemes
4.3 An Analysis of the National Health Insurance Scheme 
The NHI scheme is the most ambitious of the government's current efforts to extend health insurance coverage to all Indonesians, something that the government has never done before
Given that in the past, the government's involvement in the healthcare sector was minimal, spending only 0.6% of the national GDP on health care in 2000 (UNDP), the proposed NHI scheme is a dramatic expansion
While the government's efforts to implement this scheme have been commendable, there are several questions that could be raised regarding the proposed plan
First, many questions have been asked about the exact financing of the scheme and whether the benefits offered by the program will be adequate in comparison to the contribution rates one must pay
The 6% contribution rate for the health scheme is higher than contributions in East Asian countries that have adopted similar NHI schemes, such as Thailand and South Korea
This is a substantial financial burden for formal sector workers and their employers, 
which would significantly reduce their take-home pay, because it is assumed that employers would reduce salaries in order to pay for their share of the payroll tax
It is also questionable as to whether Indonesian workers who work in the formal sector could fully subsidize health insurance for informal sector workers or two-thirds of Indonesian workers
The types of health services that would be covered by the NHI scheme are also unclear
The government has stated that not all health services will be fully covered by the NHI program, and thus to pay for these services, participants are expected to obtain coverage from private health insurance providers or pay them out-of-pocket (GOI, Academic Paper 37)
Neither the Jamsosnas draft law nor its accompanying academic paper explicitly state what health services are going to be covered by the program or what services are not going to be covered
There have been suggestions that the NHI scheme will follow the guidelines established by the World Health Organization (WHO)
If this is correct, the services covered by the program will be quite limited and many new modern treatments will not be covered by it
In other countries, NHI schemes normally pay for both standard and extra/additional services
Thus, it is reasonable to question whether the Indonesian NHI scheme really provides good value for its participants, given the high contribution rates required to fund it and the low level of benefits offered by the scheme
One estimation (Bird) found that the average benefit for recipients would be around Rp188,000 per person (assuming that only formal sector workers contribute and receive benefits)
If the program were extended to include the entire population without contributions from informal sector workers (because their coverage is subsidized through the state budget), then the average benefit would be reduced to Rp52,000 per person, an amount so small that the benefits would be inadequate in paying for the healthcare expenses of NHI participants
Another valid question is whether all healthcare providers in Indonesia (both in the public and private sector) are willing to participate in the scheme
The draft law does not require all health providers in Indonesia to participate in the scheme
Given that most health providers in Indonesia are paid on a fee-for-service basis rather than a prospective/capitation fee reimbursement scheme, many of them would naturally prefer the former 
and it is feared that many of these providers would decline to treat patients relying exclusively on the NHI scheme, insisting that they have to pay for the services not covered by the NHI scheme in full before they could be admitted by these providers
It is feared that most private hospitals and health clinics will not participate in the scheme and thus only public hospitals and health centers will join it, because they are required by the government to do so
If the above assumption is proven correct, both the choice and the quality of treatment available to patients will be severely limited
This is a strong possibility, given that in the past, most health providers were not willing to join the Askes and Jamsostek health schemes due to the fact that they used a capitation-based reimbursement system instead of a fee-for-service system
Providers argued that under such a system, the amount of money reimbursed would be much lower than the actual costs incurred, forcing them to bear substantial losses from providing health services to patients who are members of these schemes
It is also questionable as to whether the contributions mandated by law at present (6% for formal sector workers) would be sufficient in meeting the future health expenditures of Indonesians, especially if one considers that the Indonesian population will age quite rapidly within the next few decades or so
Since older people tend to generate higher health expenditures than younger people, the cost of providing adequate health care for elderly Indonesians will increase significantly
It is doubtful that the current contribution rate will cover health expenses for all Indonesians during the next few decades
Higher contribution rates would be required, which would increase the burden for workers and employers and could cause the Indonesian economy, already less competitive compared with our neighbors today due to the presence of many legal and illegal taxes and fees, to become even less competitive
Finally, the current government plan seems to be very ambitious in wanting to achieve universal healthcare coverage for all Indonesians within a very short period of time (less than a decade)
While this goal is commendable, realistically, the process to achieve universal health coverage in many countries often takes a very long time
For instance, it took 24 years for South Korea (from 1976 to 2000) to achieve universal health coverage for its citizens (Kwon)
Thailand created its NHI scheme in 1990, but only in 1999 was it fully functional, and it will take many years for the scheme to achieve its goal of providing universal health coverage while at the same time also remaining financially sustainable (Asher)
Anyone who expects that universal health coverage can be achieved within a short time period is seriously being misled and without taking this fact into account, the process of implementing the NHI scheme in a very short period of time could have disastrous results
V CONCLUSION AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS 
5.1 General Conclusions 
Indonesia is at a crucial stage in its attempt to extend social security coverage to Indonesian workers and reform its current social security scheme so that it works better for the workers in the system
The current social security system is not sustainable and has not been successful in providing adequate benefits to participants, thanks to a relatively low rate of worker participation in the scheme, low rate of return on the national social security fund, and poor management of the scheme
Therefore, many parties acknowledge that a fundamental overhaul of the system is badly needed
The current Indonesian social security reform proposal as stated in the draft of the National Social Security Reform Bill could create a disincentive for Indonesian workers to save, does not treat all workers equally, sets up a benefit level that is too generous and could endanger the fiscal sustainability of the government
In addition, the program does not take into account the country's rapidly aging population, which could put additional fiscal strain on the government, and ignores the potential for poor governance and management
All of these issues could jeopardize the health and retirement prospects of Indonesian workers and could force them to live below the poverty line after they have retired
In most countries in the world, publicly financed social security schemes are no longer viewed as ideal
Many of these countries have pursued other alternatives to achieve universal social security coverage for their citizens and at the same time maintain competition and choice
Financing and providing social security should no longer be regarded as a government monopoly
There are many cases in which the involvement of the private sector in the provision of social security could positively improve service delivery, promote competition and innovation that would improve social security provision, and eventually, improve health and retirement outcomes for participants
Many developed and developing countries have introduced reforms to overcome the financial problems inherent in defined benefit pension schemes
Recent reforms adopted in many other countries are built around three pillars that provide old-age pensions and health insurance
Indonesia could learn from these international experiences with pension reforms
The three-pillar strategy is based on the following principles
The first pillar is a public pillar that provides a social safety net this resembles existing public pension plans such, as Jamsostek, but it is smaller and focuses on providing a social safety net for the elderly, particularly those whose lifetime incomes were low
The second pillar is a program fully managed and funded by the private sector which handles mandatory retirement schemes and insurance for participants linking benefits to contributions as in a defined contribution plan
Under a defined contribution plan, a worker's pension is linked to his/her contributions plus the return on investment
This program is fiscally sustainable in the long run as benefits are tied to worker's contributions and therefore avoids pension costs in the state budget
The third is a voluntary pillar for people who want a higher income in old age
The three-pillar approach allows private sector participation to diversify risk
Workers and employers have the option to choose a social security program that is suitable for their own needs and wants
The government can design a mandatory social security program but it is not necessary for the government to run the program as a monopoly
The program could be run cooperatively by state enterprises, private sector enterprises, and not-for-profit organizations (NGOs)
However, experiences show that the program would earn better returns for its participants if it were run by the private sector
The three-pillar option includes both public and private sector management
This is a safe social policy as it spreads risks among different providers
The government also plays an important role in two ways
First, to ensure implementation and enforcement of necessary regulations and to establish prudent financial regulations for pension funds
Second, to provide a separate social assistance program to help the poorest citizens who are no longer able to work
This would be funded through the national budget
Countries that have accomplished the above reform scheme include Argentina, Chile, and Mexico (developing countries); Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, and Poland (former socialist countries); and Australia, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (developed countries)
In addition, several other countries such as Brazil, China, and India (developing countries); Russia (former socialist country); and Italy, Singapore, and the United States (developed countries) have either planned or have already started to reform their national social security schemes using the above methods
In virtually every country that has adopted the three-pillar social security system, it has been credited in raising economic growth, competitiveness, the saving rate, and program benefits, as well as improving the business climate, and thus has increased the welfare of participants (and citizens)
5.2 Reforming the National Pension Scheme 
The current world trends in pension provisions are characterized by a shift from a pay-as-yougo pension scheme to a fully funded one, and from a publicly run system to a privately run one, and from the increasingly recognized economic fact that the government cannot serve as both the regulator and provider of a given public service
As seen in case studies, numerous developing (and developed) countries have successfully reformed their public pension schemes using the three-pillar paradigm, and thus increased worker confidence in the scheme, increased their investment returns, and improved the governance of schemes
Therefore, the Indonesian government should seriously consider changing its public pension scheme into a privately managed pension scheme based on the three-pillar paradigm
As a matter of fact, Indonesia already has the foundation for an individual retirement account scheme, because, the current provident fund scheme under the Jamsostek program is similar to individual accounts in many ways, since both schemes are fully funded and non-redistributive in nature and have defined contributions
The only major difference is that the provident fund scheme is managed by a government entity (PT Jamsostek), while the individual account scheme is managed by the private sector
While the government scheme has many problems, it is estimated that these problems would be minimized under private management
Additionally, due to the fact that Indonesia already has a defined contribution, fully funded retirement scheme, the transition from public to private management would be smoother compared to countries switching from a pay-as-you-go, defined benefit, publicly managed pension scheme to a fully funded, defined contribution, privately managed scheme
Thus, public pension reform in Indonesia would be less painful than the reform process in most European and Latin American countries, which mostly use the latter pension scheme
In this private scheme, workers should be given the choice to either manage their accounts by themselves with assistance from a financial management firm or have their accounts managed by their employer
At the same time, appropriate regulations to safeguard workers investments for their retirement need to be issued and enforced by the government
Such regulations should be kept to a reasonable level to prevent the government from intervening in the management of public pension funds while at the same time should ensure the safety of these funds from possible fraud, waste, and abuse
For this reason, the government should also possess the capacity and political will to enforce these regulations without any biases or prejudices towards any parties in order to maintain worker confidence in the system
5.3 Reforming the National Healthcare Scheme 
The same also goes for national healthcare reform
Instead of requiring citizens to participate in a government-run national health scheme, with high contribution rates but low benefits, that would reduce the country's competitiveness in comparison to neighboring countries, the government should use incentives to induce people to purchase private health insurance
This could include a tax credit to help pay health insurance premiums or a medical savings account plan set up by private financial firms in which workers could save a portion of their salaries, and if they made withdrawals from this account for their healthcare needs, they would not be subjected to any taxes or fees
Health policy experts have advocated the creation of a public-private partnership in healthcare provision, in which the government delegates some of its responsibilities in healthcare (such as providing health services) to the private (both not-for-profit and forprofit) sector, while maintaining its functions to collect contributions and issue regulations
There are many developing countries that have been successful in creating such a partnership at the same time as achieving near-universal health coverage for their citizens, such as Chile, Columbia, and Venezuela
Another policy that could be pursued by the government is promoting the creation of microhealth insurance schemes and community/occupational health funds for informal sector workers
Such policies would help obtain universal health coverage for all Indonesians while at the same time promote competition and innovation in the country's healthcare market as well as increase the competitiveness of the Indonesian economy
This is appropriate because the private sector has already played a major role in the Indonesian healthcare system
Thus, they have to be given a significant role in the country's efforts to achieve universal healthcare coverage
Finally, since most Indonesian workers still work in the informal sector, special consideration needs to be given to informal sector workers
A universal healthcare coverage scheme should incorporate the needs of informal sector workers living in different regions and settings in Indonesia
Thus, it is preferable for this scheme to be decentralized so that local conditions and needs can be accommodated
It is also preferable for the scheme to be established by a given community or an association of workers in a similar profession (e.g., an association of becak drivers, food peddlers, etc.) to create common links between individuals working in such professions/communities
Thus, the scheme would be truly in the interests and needs of the workers/communities
5.4 Concluding Remarks 
In short, the time is right to simultaneously extend social security coverage to both formal and informal sector workers in Indonesia and reform the existing social security system through competition and private sector participation to help Indonesia meet the goal of providing social security provisions for all Indonesian citizens and a system that works better for all Indonesians
If this reform is successfully accomplished, it is hoped that Indonesia will truly become a joyful and prosperous nation as our founding fathers envisioned when they declared independence
(3) Limited Employment Opportunities
The absence or lack of employment opportunities is one of the causes of poverty that was most often mentioned by the community in various discussions
Employment opportunities in rural areas are increasingly limited due to lack of land and the declining trend in land productivity, high population growth, lack of investment in nonagricultural industry, and lack of access to capital
The lack of employment availability has encouraged the community to utilize land, including forestry land, for farming
This has resulted in environmental degradation in the manner discussed in point 1 above
The low level of formal education, especially amongst the poor and the lack of skills in general (related to point 4), create problems for finding employment outside the district or for developing businesses
Nevertheless, many families have been trying to put their children to school, including by selling their production assets to meet the high cost of education, with the hope that their children will obtain better work and income
Therefore, unemployment is the main problem faced and has the potential to worsen poverty in the future
In the context of the conditions in Kabupaten Bima, the effort to overcome the problem of limited employment opportunities needs to be undertaken by using a comprehensive approach, including through
Improvements in agricultural production and by overcoming vulnerability in the manner suggested in point 2 above
Provision of capital that can be easily accessed by the community
The community is still very dependent on moneylenders
Existing UPKD in Desa Waworada, for example, could become one source of capital assistance, although the beneficiaries are quite limited to the middle class
For that reason, a system of sustainable and effective financial institutions is yet to be found
Education, training, and extension that supports work skills, both in the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors
Facilitation of the channeling and placement of labor in industries or outside the district through the provision of information and protection of workers
Controlling population growth by increasing community participation in family planning (see point 5 below)
(4) Low Level of Education and Skills In various discussions, the community suggested that the low level of education and skills is a cause of poverty because it impedes access to obtain better work
The lack of skills is also considered the cause of the low level of knowledge and capability to develop farming businesses
Most of the poor only completed primary school
The problems presented in the PPA are varied, among the main ones is the lack of incentives due to the limited employment opportunities
The poor in particular, feel that education does not guarantee that they will obtain better jobs
This causes the parents of poor families to be unsupportive of their children going to school
In addition, in several locations, such as Desa Waworada, the distance to the nearest junior high school is too far
To overcome these problems, there is a need for, inter alia, scholarship assistance for the poor and the provision of an education infrastructure that can be equally and easily accessed by the community in all districts
Improving formal education needs to be approached from a sociological perspective through improving the poor's motivation to educate their children, aside from taking into account the specific needs of a district
The effort to improve education and skills also needs to be undertaken in a integrated manner, with the efforts suggested in points 1, 2, and 3 above, especially through sustainable community assistance programs
(5) Family Planning Another causative factor of poverty that was brought up in the PPAs is the number of children, and in general, poor families have more children
The results of the PPAs suggest that the community has quite a lot of information on family planning (KB)
The village midwife and the pustu are the main source of information and they are quite close to the community
In discussions with poor families, however, it was stated that most of them could not afford the cost of contraceptives
In discussions with the Family Planning Agency, it was indicated that the subsidy available for contraceptives is only sufficient for 60% of the poor who are in their reproductive age
It could possibly be less than this because families that are not too poor could be using some of these contraceptives
In addition, at the kabupaten level, the number of family planning field workers (PLKB) and village midwives are only 1/3 of the amount actually needed
With such condition although there have, in general, been improvements in the coverage of the family planning program these improvements have only occurred among the middle class and upper-middle class, while the poor are often not covered by KB programs
Hence, special efforts and strategies are needed to improve the outreach of KB programs among the poor through improving services, communication, and information, as well as education on KB programs
(6) Institutional Issues Indirectly, the various discussions with the community indicate that, in general, the community is quite close to village government, religious, education, and health institutions at the local level
Access of the poor to institutions supporting economic activities, such as capital providers and marketing and cooperative institutions is very low
In addition, their access to information on assistance and development programs is relatively poor
Decisions on the implementation or supervision of projects or programs are still dominated by the village elite
The knowledge of women, in particular, is more limited because women tend to only know about programs that are especially aimed at women, such as the KB program or skills training which scope is also very limited
These conditions impede program effectiveness and tend to be incapable of supporting the actual needs of the poor
For that reason, there needs to be changes in the policy as well as the behavior of project and program managers so that there is a more equal distribution of information for both men and women, and hence better targeting accuracy of the poor
In addition, there is a need for the provision of financial institutions that can be accessed by the poor, as well as institutions that can open and enhance market access
3.2 Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah
3.2.1 Regional Conditions and Poverty Trend
Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah is located on the western coast of the North Sumatra Province
The western part of this kabupaten borders the Indian Ocean, the northern part borders Kabupaten Singkil (in the Province of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam), the eastern part borders Kabupaten Tapanuli Utara, and to the south with Kabupaten Tapanuli Selatan
In 2003, the kabupaten had an area of approximately 2,194.98 km2 with a population of approximately 275,800 people, which makes a population density of 126 people per km.2 
Administratively, this kabupaten consists of 15 kecamatan and 160 villages, with a population density that varies between kecamatan
Kecamatan Pandan, that is the capital of the kabupaten, is the kecamatan with the densest population (871 people per km2)
Meanwhile, the kecamatan with the least dense population is Kecamatan Kolang with approximately 40 people per km2
Almost all kecamatan are located on the coastline that extends for 200 km
Only two kecamatan, Kecamatan Sibabangun and Kecamatan Sitahuis, are located in hilly areas and do not have a coastal area
Because this kabupaten is located along the Bukit Barisan Mountains, its topography varies between low plains along the coast and hilly terrain with an altitude between sea level and 1,266 meters above sea-level
The climate of the district is Type A according to Oldeman's Classification, with high rainfall of approximately 4,842 mm/year and 10-11 wet months per annum
The combination of high rainfall and fertile mountainous terrain has awarded this district with abundant natural resources, including tropical forests, plantation crops, food crops, and ocean fisheries
The forestry area of this kabupaten covers approximately 132,974 hectares, consisting of 74,504 hectares of protected forest, 51,273 hectares of production forest and 7,197 hectares of conversion forest
In 2003, the area under plantations was approximately 40,000 hectares and was planted with a variety of plantation crops, especially rubber, palm oil, and cacao
The area of wet-rice lands was approximately 17,808 hectares, half of which obtain irrigation from semi-technical and traditional irrigation system
The rest is rain-fed wet-rice fields and marshlands that are planted with rice only in certain seasons
The economy of Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah is dominated by the agriculture sector
In 2003, the contribution of the agricultural sector to the regional GDP was approximately 54%
Other sectors with a significant contribution are trade, hotel, and restaurant (16%), manufacturing industry (11%), and other services (10%)
The transport and communication, banking and finance, and construction sectors only contributed approximately 3%
Meanwhile, the contribution of the electricity, gas, and water sector, and mining and quarrying sectors, are respectively less than 1%
More than 70% of households in this kabupaten also work in the agricultural sector, namely rice farming and other food crops, plantations, and fishery
The people that live along the coastline are, in general, working as fishers and food crop farmers at the same time, while the people that lives on the high plains live on farming food crops and plantations
Most fishers still use traditional technology such as small non-motorized boats
Some work as fishing laborers on other peoples' vessels
In several places, simple fish processing industries, such as those for the processing of salted or dried fish, also support the livelihoods of the coastal communities
Several decades ago, Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah was a relatively prosperous area
The ports of Barus and Sibolga were busy with trading vessels that loaded sea and plantation products
The road along the west coast that runs through Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah was the main trading route that connected Aceh (Kabupaten Singkil) and the Province of West Sumatra
This prosperity faded after the development of ports and main roads on the east coast of Sumatra
This east coast development diverted the center of trade away from the west coast causing less economic activity in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah
Activities in the ports also decreased, meanwhile the road from the west coast to the east coast was difficult to pass through because of the hilly terrain in the Bukit Barisan Mountains
This has impeded access to the new center of economic activities on the east coast
For that reason, Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah became increasingly left behind compared to other kabupaten, although it is endowed with abundant natural wealth
The slow economic growth of this kabupaten compared with average economic growth of the province during the period of 2000-2003 is presented in Figure 6
Poverty data published by BPS shows that the poverty condition in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah is of increasing concern (Figure 7)
The number of people who live below the poverty line continued to increase from 54,500 in 1999 to 55,500 in 2002, 56,500 in 2003 and jumped to 87,070 in 2004
Compared with other kabupaten in the Province of North Sumatra, Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah is the kabupaten with the second largest proportion of poor people after Kabupaten Nias
Although poverty in the Province of North Sumatra has tended to decline, poverty in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah has continued to rise
Both the human development index (HDI) and the human poverty index (HPI) show how left behind this kabupaten is compared with the provincial average
In 2002, the HDI for Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah was 65.8, a little lower than the provincial average (68.8), while the HPI of this kabupaten was 30.2, a little higher than the provincial average (27.8)
All human development indicators showed that Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah had been left behind in almost all aspects, including life expectancy, educational attainment, purchasing power, and access to potable water, as well as nutritional status of children under the age of five years
The only achievement that equals the provincial average is regarding access to health infrastructure
The community has a different perspective with regard to the trend in the change of the level of community welfare in the three PPA villages in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah
In general, FGD participants in the two villages, Desa Sipange and Desa Mombang Boru, differentiate the community into three welfare categories, namely rich households known as 'well-off' , 'middle class' households, and poor households known as 'less well-off'
The characteristics of families that are considered poor are presented in Appendix 6
Based on this categorization, very few households (5%) are classified as wealthy in these two villages
For Desa Sipange, approximately 40% of households are classified as poor, while in Desa Mombang Boru approximately 72% of households are classified as poor
Compared with the welfare condition five years earlier, FGD participants in these two villages were of the opinion that their welfare level had tended to improve (Table 4)
The increase in community welfare in these two villages is supported by the increased production of several types of plantation crops, especially palm oil and cacao
In addition, other crops that also improved the incomes of people in Desa Sipange are durian and citrus fruit in Desa Mombang Boru
The community in these two villages had also enjoyed improvements in the availability of transportation, means of communication, including availability of connections to cellular phones, and access to health services
For that reason, the fall in rice production that occurred as a result of the damage to the irrigation network, floods, and the inefficiency of water-usage management institutions, did not have a significant impact on community welfare in general
The welfare condition of the community in Desa Kinali is different to the other two PPA villages
At the time of the discussions, FGD participants stressed that there was no one in this village who could be categorized as wealthy
For that reason, there are only two welfare classifications in this village, the middle group, known as the 'less well-off' and the poor, known as the 'not well-off'
Most households are categorized in the middle group (73%)
This condition is rather different to the results of the mapping, direct observations, and additional information provided by other village members
From this range of information, it is estimated that approximately 6% of households can be categorized as wealthy, 40% as middle class and the rest (44%) as poor, of whom approximately 9% can be deemed as very poor
This difference may be caused by the fact that during the time of the FGD, participants more often used the condition of the house as the reference, whereas the condition of the house, most of which were inherited, cannot always reflect the condition of their occupant' lives
Other causes of bias were probably because of the presence of the Coremap project which might provide capital assistance
Some FGD participants were afraid that those classified as wealthy would not receive this assistance
In contrast to the other two PPA villages, FGD participants in Desa Kinali suggested that the level of community welfare in their village had tended to fall
Approximately five years beforehand, Desa Kinali had more residents and more of them were in the middle welfare category of this village
Most of them moved to other villages, particularly to Desa Pasar Tarandam because of the lively economy in this neighboring village and more employment and business opportunities are available there
The decline in the village's welfare began at least during the last decade because fishing vessels could no longer moor in Desa Kinali as a result of the silting up of the river mouth
With the move of the mooring point, other activities such as unloading, handling and processing, trading and of stalls also moved
Meanwhile, the fishing catchments continued to decline because of the damages to the coral reefs as a result of bombing and the operation of seine-net fishing vessels from Thailand
This situation worsened with the decline in rice production as a result of pest attacks and flooding that became more frequent
Flooding, in fact, became more extensive and often entered peoples' houses as well as damaged bridges, causing transportation condition to and within the village to worsen
For that reason, although there was already an increase in education and communication services, especially telephone communication, the welfare of the community still tended to decline
Although the results of the analysis of poverty trends from the PPA were not in line with the results of the analysis of the poverty trend according to the BPS data, several important things can be drawn from the analysis of these two sets of data
In general, the PPA results explain the dynamics of poverty in communities with various livelihood typologies
The communities whose welfare has tended to improve are the farmers who have started diversifying into new plantation commodities, especially palm oil, cacao, and fruit
In addition, the communities in the semi-urban districts whose education levels are relatively high have also tended to have an increase in their level of welfare
However, the welfare level of wet-rice farmers and fishers, who constitute a large proportion of the population of Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah, has tended to move downwards
This can probably explain the trend of increased poverty in this kabupaten
In addition, in the discussions with various stakeholders at the kabupaten level the issue of migration of people from surrounding districts, especially from Nias, was raised
It is suspected that this has added to the number of poor population
The PPA that was undertaken in three villages
The areas which are the centers of rice production and fishery that are considered not too poor and the areas where there are a lot of migrants from other districts are not included in this study
Future implementation of PPAs in these areas will be necessary in order to deepen the understanding on the dynamics of poverty in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah
3.2.2 Factors that Influence Poverty
With plenty of natural resources and a climate that is very conducive to agricultural activities, the poverty problem in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah cannot be explained as easily as the condition and problems of poverty faced in Kabupaten Bima
For that reason, during the workshop and preliminary consultation with stakeholders at the kabupaten level, there were many opinions highlighting human resources and behavior as the cause of poverty in this kabupaten
The outcome of the discussions with the community that were held during the PPA activity in the three selected villages, however, successfully uncovered five main issues that affect poverty condition in this kabupaten
issues associated with livelihoods, education, infrastructure, environment, and family planning
(1) Livelihoods
The previous sub-section has described how the dynamics of poverty in this kabupaten are very much influenced by changes in the management of farming enterprises or community livelihoods in general
Discussions with the community in Desa Sipange and Desa Mombang Boru suggested that income from palm oil plantations, cacao, and various types of fruit have tended to rise
Nevertheless, the community itself has largely initiated the development of these commodities because government assistance and extension programs were felt to be very lacking
These efforts faced marketing problems and lack of capital
The poor were still very dependent on informal loans from traders, shopkeepers, stallholders, or high-interest credit provided by several informal institutions in semiurban areas
Because of this, the allocation of family income for debt repayments was still quite high
The production of food crops, especially rice that is very much a community mainstay, has tended to fall
This is caused by the decrease of farmland area and declines in productivity
The decrease of cultivated land area for wet-rice farming is caused by a fall in the supply of irrigation water due to the damage to dams or canals, flooding, and the lack of irrigation management because P3A officials are not carrying out their function
Besides being a result of the irrigation and flood problems, the decline in rice productivity, according to the community, is also caused by the increase of pest attacks
This decline in rice production has significantly impacted on the income of the poor, who mostly work as farm laborers or penggarap based on a production sharing system
In several places, such as Desa Kinali, the sharing system has made things very difficult for the penggarap
The decline in income is also faced by the sea-fishing community because fish catches are continuing to decrease
According to the community, this has happened because of the damage to coral reefs as a result of fish bombing and the operation of Thai purse-seine vessels from outside the district
Most of the poor work as fishing laborers on large vessels owned by toke, and their lives are very dependent on the owners of these vessels
Debt entrapment and the relationship of fishing industry workers and employers that tends to disadvantage the workers, perpetuate poverty amongst these workers
Meanwhile, alternative livelihoods, such as in the form of fish cultivation or others, do not yet exist
Other sources of income that support the lives of the poor and become their survival strategy are collecting forestry products, such as honey, rattan, cave bats, or fruit, and raising small livestock, such as pigs, chickens, ducks, and goats
This utilization of the forest is threatened by uncontrolled denudation of the forest by several irresponsible parties
Meanwhile, there is no protection available in the raising of small animals in terms of controlling and preventing diseases
Employment opportunities outside the agricultural sector are still very limited, so many people, especially in semi-urban areas, have migrated to other districts
The decline in income in the agricultural sector and the success of several migrant workers who have worked in other districts have encouraged greater community interest in working outside the district
To overcome these problems, there needs to be changes in policy and the focus of programs in the agricultural, livestock, plantation, and forestry sectors
In order to fulfill farmers' needs for better farming technology, pest and disease prevention (including for small farm animals), and marketing, there is a need to activate and reorient extension activities
In regard to these extension activities, attention should be given to the role of women that appears to be very dominant in the cultivation of food crops, in order to ensure that they obtain access to these services
To overcome the problems of irrigation in wet-rice farming, in particular, improvements in irrigation infrastructure need to be undertaken (see point 3), the problem of forest denudation (point 4) needs to be attended to, and water supply regulatory institutions need to be revitalized
The protection of marine resources is also necessary to increase fisher's incomes
These efforts also need to be integrated with the introduction of alternative livelihoods
In addition, it is necessary to enhance access to capital to support farming enterprises, as well as to enhance remote villages' or the sea-fishing communities' access to community savings, for example through mobile banking
On top of all these efforts, the need to obtain work in the non-agricultural sector needs to be supported through the provision of non-formal education, improvements in investment in labor-intensive agriculturebased industries, and protection programs for migrant workers
(2) Education
Although in several areas, especially in semi-urban areas, the average level of education is already quite high, most poor families are only able to educate their children up to the primary school level or, at most, junior high school
In fishing communities, in particular, many boys drop out of school at the primary level and work as fishing laborers or assist their parents fishing using the family's own traditional boats
A number of factors cause poor children to drop out of primary or junior high school, including
the low level of awareness about the importance of continuing school, their interest to work as fishers, and the fact that many poor families cannot afford to send their children to high school because of the school's distance and high cost of transportation
Only primary schools are present in almost all villages, while junior and senior high schools are located in the kecamatan capital, which is quite far from the isolated villages that have difficult access to transportation
The lack of motivation to continue education is also caused by the fact that many junior and senior high school graduates have not been absorbed in the local labor market and became unemployed
Although the community is aware that low level of education and skills cause poverty, only in a few urban and semi-urban areas there are people with fairly high motivation to achieve high education level
This motivation developed as a result of witnessing successful migrant workers who have fairly high educational background
Considering these problems, it appears that special initiatives are necessary to undertake in order to increase the education level of the poor
One effort is by establishing primary/junior high schools under one roof to improve the access of the poor to higher education
In addition, there is a need for a special approach to attract boys in the fishing community to stay in school, for example by establishing schools with a more flexible time schedule
To increase school motivation, there is also a need to integrate the enhancement of education and working skills with the provision of employment opportunities
(3) Infrastructure
The development of road infrastructure and means of communication, especially in Desa Sipange, supported improvements in the community's welfare because they gave way to smoother trade of agricultural products and easier access to health and education services
Road and bridge conditions in the other two PPA villages, however, are still very alarming
Several roads heading towards Desa Mombang Boru and within this village are in poor condition because of a lack of maintenance
Several bridges are also flood-damaged
The same situation is also faced by Desa Kinali, whose access was cut off because bridges were washed away every time there was a flood
In fact, one bridge that connects Desa Kinali and its neighboring village had already been damaged by a flood six months after it was built
According to the local community, the construction of these bridges did not anticipate the frequent occurrence of floods, and also did not involve the local community in its planning and construction
In fact, the construction of the water-retaining barrier in Desa Pasar Tarandam that was built by the provincial government has caused flooding in Desa Kinali
The condition of the irrigation system in Desa Sipange and Desa Mombang Boru which should provide water for the rice fields in these villages is also damaged
The damage occurred because of a lack of maintenance, flood, and the silting-up of the dam
The management of irrigation canals has not been operating for some time and the community from early on did not feel responsible for the management and supervision of the existing irrigation network
The emergence of these problems shows that there is a need for a change in the approach used for the planning and construction of infrastructure projects
These projects should involve the community more
In addition, infrastructure development needs to take into account the risk of natural disasters that can potentially damage it
(4) Environment
The community did not directly mention the issue of environmental destruction as the cause of poverty
However, the community raised many problems which arose as a result of environmental destruction caused by poverty
One of these problems were the silting-up of the river mouth in Desa Kinali that resulted in fishing vessels being unable to moor there
As a consequence, the unloading of fish was moved to another village
In addition, flooding and abrasion that damaged the irrigation network, bridges, and inundated the rice fields were also mentioned in the three PPA villages
Although FGDs participants in the villages did not directly mention forest denudation as its cause, several stakeholders who attended the workshop certainly suggested a need to pay attention to the issue of illegal logging
Environmental degradation also occurs in the coastal and marine environment of this kabupaten
The declining fish catch that was mentioned in Desa Kinali, was also raised by the community in Desa Jago-Jago, the village that was the pilot site at the time of the PPA training
In the community's opinion, this decline was caused by the damage to the coral reef as a result of fish bombing and the operation of Thai purse-seine vessels
In the workshop forum at the kabupaten level, stakeholders also confirmed it
In order to overcome this problem, a community based supervision system is required to oversee the use of bombing and the operation of Thai purse seines
In addition, efforts should be undertaken to re-plant and protect the coral reefs
(5) Family Planning
Many poor families have a lot of children
The number of family members adds more burden to poor families
The adat of the community gives great priority to male children
As a consequence, families continue to have children until they have a son
Aside from the issue of adat, several opinions raised in the FGDs also showed that there was a misperception about the side effects of the use of contraceptive
In Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah, women have a significant economic role and responsibility because, in general, they work in the wet-rice fields, dry lands, look after small livestock, and look for firewood
For that reason, they have to be physically strong
There is a misperception in the community, especially among the less well-off, that the use of contraceptive often causes bleeding and physical weakness, so women using contraception will not be able to work in the fields
This misperception could not be immediately corrected because many village midwives do not live or settle in their duty station, so they do not maintain a close relationship with the community
In Desa Kinali, for example, there is no midwife
Although the distance to the puskesmas (community healthcare center) and midwife in the neighboring village is only 1.5 km, deliveries are usually performed by a traditional midwife who does not provide family planning services
Posyandu activities are also seldom undertaken
In order to overcome this problem, there needs to be an effort to improve family planning programs through extension activities and by paying closer attention to complaints about complications caused by contraceptive devices
Health and family planning officials also need to build a closer relationship with the poor groups in the community, as well as undertaking efforts to revitalize posyandu activities
IV REGIONAL CAPACITY IN POVERTY REDUCTION
Based on information gathered in the research locations and through interactions with the regional governments and other stakeholders during the conduct of this study, differences were observed in the capacity of the two kabupaten in poverty reduction
Regional capacity in this context does not constitute the financial capacity of regional governments, but it refers to instead, to the institutional capacity that encompasses institutional structures, the understanding of and attention to poverty problems, as well as poverty reduction programs and policies that have already been drawn up and implemented in the respective regions
In general, Kabupaten Bima has a relatively better capacity than Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah
This difference is influenced, inter alia, by the district's poverty condition, the development and activities of NGOs, and the activities of donor institutions
With a condition of very dry climate and infertile land, poverty is a chronic problem in Kabupaten Bima
For that reason, poverty has long been the main focus of the regional government and the general community of Kabupaten Bima
On the other hand, for the community and the Government of Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah, poverty is not included on their main agenda because community life, in general, is very much supported by the region's wealth of natural resources
Advances in the capacity of Kabupaten Bima are also supported by the development of NGOs that operate in various fields, from community empowerment activities at the grass-roots level to advocacy type of activities
In addition, the large number of assistances from donor institutions, both those that focus directly on overcoming poverty as well as those that enhance regional government capacity, have also increased the capacity of Kabupaten Bima in poverty reduction
The following sub-section presents a description of the capacity of the two kabupaten, particularly their poverty reduction institutions, poverty reduction policies and programs, and the affect of these capacity differences on the effectiveness of the effort to enhance regional government capacity through PPAs that have been carried out in this study
4.1 Poverty Reduction Institutions
4.1.1 The Capacity of the Poverty Reduction Institutions of Regional Government
Both Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah and Kabupaten Bima have formed Regional Poverty Reduction Committees (KPKD) in the manner instructed by the Ministry of Home Affairs
The appointment of the KPKD members is determined each year through a decree from the head of the kabupaten (bupati)
Nevertheless, the structure of the membership and activities undertaken by the KPKD in the two kabupaten differs
For that reason, this study uncovered the differences in the structure of the institutions and in the progress of regional government efforts in poverty reduction in these two kabupaten
In general, Kabupaten Bima's institutional structure for poverty reduction is relatively more inclusive than that of Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah
Nevertheless, the structure that was formed in Kabupaten Bima is apparently still not sufficiently effective in coordinating and supporting poverty reduction efforts in this kabupaten
The KPKD in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah was formally established in 2003 based on Bupati Decree No 255/PMD of Year 2003
The membership consisted of 10 regional government working units
The bupati formally leads the KPKD, with the head of the PMD office as the executive director
The KPKD secretary is from the PMD office, while the head of Bappeda is the advisor
Since its formation and until this study was conducted, the KPKD has not carried out any activity because it has not obtained any funding support from the kabupaten government
The sectoral agencies are also unaware of the existence of the KPKD
For that reason, Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah has not started the formulation of their regional PRSP and has not yet commenced efforts to coordinate poverty reduction policies and programs
Several programs run by sectoral agencies that are given the label 'poverty reduction' are still being undertaken by each agency and are, in general, coordinated by Bappeda
In Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah, the data collection on poor families was undertaken by the Family Planning and Civic Registration Agency by using the criteria on Preprosperous and Welfare Level 1 families that were determined by BKKBN
Besides being used for family planning programs, this data was also used for targeting of the cheap rice for the poor program (Raskin)
The targeting of the health insurance program for the poor is determined by other criteria based on the operating guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health in the program implementation guide
The puskesmas and village midwife undertook the data collection for this program
Meanwhile, the targeting conducted by other sectoral agencies was also carried out by each agency based on criteria determined by each sector
Although the KPKD has not undertaken any activities, the statistics office of Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah has made several analyses of the poverty condition in this kabupaten
By using the 1999-2002 data, BPS Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah has published a poverty analysis that discusses the trend in the poverty rate, human development index, and human poverty index
In addition, BPS Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah also undertook the identification of underdeveloped villages based on several local indicators, and participated in a project to develop indicators associated with poverty that was undertaken by the central office of BPS
Unfortunately, the kabupaten government has not utilized the results of these analyses in the formulation of regional programs and policies
Meanwhile, the KPKD of Kabupaten Bima that was formally established through Bupati Decree No 95 of Year 2004, consists of government and non-government elements
The management of this KPKD consists of the Bupati of Bima as the head, the Regional Secretary, the Administrative Assistant for Development and Welfare, and the head of Bappeda as advisors, the BPMPP head as executive director, and the head of Economic Affairs of BPMPP as secretary
To undertake its task, the KPKD has formed four working groups (pokja), namely
(i) Pokja I, covering the areas of Publications, Information, and Data, with the head of BPS as coordinator
(ii) Pokja II covering the Development of LKM and UKM, with the head of the Trade and Industry Office as coordinator
(iii) Pokja III as Manager of Programs and Activities, with the head of the Health Office as coordinator
(iv) Pokja IV for Monitoring and Evaluation, with coordination of the head of Program Development in the Regional Secretariat
The non-government elements of these working groups consisted of representatives of higher education institutions, NGOs, mass organizations, and donor agencies
The higher education elements include representatives of STISIPs and STIEs
NGO elements include LP3M, Yayasan Bangun Daya Bima, and Yayasan Peduli Bangun Bangsa
Elements from mass organizations are MUI, from private institutions, PD Wawo, and from donor agencies, Promis-NT
Since its formation, the KPKD of Kabupaten Bima has conducted several activities, including
(1) A stock-take on poverty reduction programs that have been conducted by various government agencies in 2003-2004
(2) Data collection on Productive Economic Business Groups (2003) that was formed through the UED-SP Program, IDT, PDM-DKE, Lumbung Desa, and the NTAADP Program
(3) Data collection on poor families in Kabupaten Bima (2003) by using local indicators that were a combination of indicators used by BPS, BKKBN, and those suggested by other relevant agencies
(4) Formulation of a Regional PRSP draft
Based on the criteria developed by this KPKD, the results of the data collection on poor families in 2003/2004 showed that there were a total of approximately 42,500 poor households in Kabupaten Bima
This number is far greater than the results of the Susenas data estimation based on the Poverty Line approach that came up with 98,800 people or 24,000 households
This data collection on poor families appeared to have not, however, been used as a reference for the determination of program targets in poverty reduction programs undertaken by various sectoral agencies
This was the case because this data collection did not include specific data that was appropriate to the need of associated sectors
In addition, several agencies are also of the opinion that the results of the data collection are not that up-to-date, while the regional government faces cost-related obstacles of updating the data for the following years
Bappeda initiated the formulation of the draft Regional PRSP in Kabupaten Bima in 2004 with the support of Promis NT
Furthermore, the preliminary draft prepared by Bappeda was improved based on input from the members of the KPKD
Nevertheless, in the preparation of this draft, there were no consultations with the general public or with the poor
The review of the final version of the draft Regional PRSP showed that the document, in general, followed the framework suggested by the interim National PRSP document
However, there were several weaknesses in this draft, among others, the diagnosis of poverty that only uses very limited poverty data, the policy review that presented the programs of the previous years without discussing the effectiveness of these programs, the lack of clear direction concerning poverty reduction policies, and the presence of programs that are still very general and not strongly associated with poverty
Although the KPKD of Kabupaten Bima has undertaken several activities, many parties, including several members of the KPKD, assess that the effectiveness of this institution in coordinating poverty reduction programs and policies as still weak
The weakness of the role of this KPKD is due, among other reasons, to the very limited funding support from regional government that did not make it possible for the implementation of more intensive coordination meetings
Furthermore, the fundamental cause was rooted in the institutional structure of the KPKD itself
Because of an instruction from the Ministry of Home Affairs, the position of director of the KPKD was assigned to the head of BPMPP and the secretariat of the KPKD is also located in the office of the BPMPP
Based on its functions and tasks, the BPMPP is not responsible for coordinating development in the region
It is Bappeda, who is responsible for the coordination function
So in practice, the Bappeda, which has the data and not to mention, more staff competency to implement the coordination, more often took coordination initiative for poverty reduction efforts, in conjunction with its role in coordinating development in general
Therefore, although the KPKD secretariat is in the office of the BPMPP, in practice, Bappeda plays a bigger role in the formulation of the Regional PRSP and in providing input to the poverty reduction agenda in regional planning documents
After Presidential Regulation (Perpres) Number 54 of Year 2005 on the Formation of a Coordination Team on Poverty Reduction (TKPK) was issued, the institution responsible for poverty reduction at the central government level was shifted from the Poverty Reduction Committee (KPK) to the Coordination Team on Poverty Reduction (TKPK)
As a follow-up action, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued the Ministry of Home Affair Circular No 412.6/3186/SJ, which instructed that all regions adjusted their poverty reduction institutions in line with the changes at the central government level
In response to this circular, Kabupaten Bima stated that the coordination of various poverty reduction programs and policies that had been undertaken by the KPKD would be continued, developed, and improved by the TKPK
Criticism arose, however, that the appointment of the members of the TPKP in the Minister's circular was too exclusive because it only consisted of government elements
This was considered to be a step backward, bearing in mind that the membership of the KPKD had already provided greater space for the participation of non-government elements
4.1.2 The Role of Non-Government Institutions in Poverty Reduction
The development of various forms of non-government institutions in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah is different from those in Kabupaten Bima
In Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah, most non-government institutions are in the form of mass organizations that, among others, include religious and youth institutions
NGOs are still very rare
Several existing NGOs are focusing more on politics or public advocacy and there is very few or almost none working in the area of community development at the grass-root level
Although various existing mass organizations have activities that directly or indirectly assist less well-off communities, it can be said that the role of these non-government institutions in poverty reduction is very limited
In conditions where poverty reduction institutions do not adopt a participatory approach and do not accommodate the role of non-government elements in development planning processes, the role of nongovernment institutions in policy advocacy of poverty reduction is also very weak
Nevertheless, there are indications that the regional government has recently started to involve non-government elements in the development planning process by inviting nongovernment elements to the rakorbang (development coordination meetings) at the kabupaten level
In Kabupaten Bima, NGOs developed rapidly and it is estimated that there are hundreds
It is quite difficult to obtain the exact number of NGOs because many of them are newly formed, while others are no longer active
The development of these NGOs has been supported, inter alia, by the large number of programs supported by donor agencies and international NGOs that channel assistances to the community through local NGOs
Furthermore, there are also various cooperations between local NGOs and the regional government in the implementation of poverty reduction programs and projects
Activities that have been undertaken by various NGOs are varied, starting from activities that are advocacy in nature to activities of community empowerment and development at the grass-roots level
Several NGOs in Kabupaten Bima are also involved in independent monitoring and evaluation and provide inputs for the improvement of government programs and policies
Compared with the conditions in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah, the direct role of NGOs in Kabupaten Bima in poverty reduction is relatively greater and it is also the case with their role in the advocacy of poverty reduction policies
The significant role of NGOs in policy advocacy is also very much supported by the institutional structure of the KPKD that is more open to the participation of nongovernment institutions, as well as the development of a more participatory development planning process
Nevertheless, the wide participation of non-government stakeholders in Kabupaten Bima is not yet followed by intensive coordination for the purpose of enhancing the effectiveness of various existing poverty reduction programs
The management of programs across government agencies, across non-government agencies (NGOs/higher education institutions), and between the regional government and non-government institutions, beginning from the planning and implementation phases as well as monitoring and evaluation is being run separately
This is an impediment that still needs to be overcome by all parties in Kabupaten Bima and it appears that the KPKD is not yet capable of playing an effective role in this coordination effort
4.2 Poverty Reduction Programs and Policies
Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah and Kabupaten Bima adopted different approaches in their regional development plan
These reflect the differences in the attention and views of the governments on the problem of poverty in their regions
Based on the review of the existing development planning documents, it can be seen that the focus of development in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah is more directed to physical development and infrastructure that, in turn, is expected to improve the welfare of the community, without special directives to overcome poverty
Meanwhile, in the development planning documents of Kabupaten Bima, including in the draft of the PRSP and the Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJM), attention to poverty issues is stated more explicitly
In these documents, it is stated that the development approach adopted by the regional government does not only rely on physical development and infrastructure, but also emphasizes on efforts to empower the community
4.2.1 Poverty Reduction Programs and Policies in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah
The fact that Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah is a kabupaten rich with natural resources tends to cause the local government to pay insufficient attention to the problem of poverty
Many stakeholders are in the opinion that poverty is often found among poor fishers because of their squandering behavior and among immigrants from other districts, especially from Nias, most of who are working as plantation or fishing laborers
The problem most often raised at the kabupaten level is the lack of development in the western coast of Sumatra and their isolation from the economic growth centers in the east coast region
Attention to poverty issues is also limited due to political instability in this kabupaten
The development vision of Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah is to develop the kabupaten into a center for trade and the tourist industry in the western coast area of Sumatra or in the Tapanuli region
'Tapanuli Growth' is the program most publicly stated by the Bupati of Tapanuli Tengah
Through the development of integrated land, sea, and air transports, this kabupaten wishes to develop agricultural and tourism-based industries that, in turn, will create many employment opportunities, improve the trade in agricultural products, and eventually increase community welfare
Based on the Kabupaten's Strategic Plan (Renstra) 2000-2005, the development priority is directed towards infrastructure development, followed by the development of human resources through improving education and health services and support for good governance
Among the largest infrastructure developments are the development of a seaport, airport, and hydroelectric power station
Although there is no special directive for a poverty reduction policy in the planning document, almost all sectoral agencies in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah consider the programs they are implementing are aimed at enhancing the welfare of farmers, fishers, or the people who inhabit remote areas, so these programs could be classified as poverty reduction programs
The central and provincial governments through deconcentration and co-administration funds finance most of these programs
Foreign assistance projects/programs in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah are very limited and there is practically no assistance from international NGOs
Most poverty reduction programs in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah are economic empowerment programs for the community through increasing agricultural and fisheries production as well as capital assistance for cooperatives and UMKM
Among the community economic empowerment programs that have been undertaken in this kabupaten are the PEMP Program of the Ministry of Fisheries and Maritime Affairs, the Kecamatan Development Program (PPK) of the World Bank, and P2D from the JBIC
Assistance from other donor institutions include the Coral Reef Rehabilitation (Coremap) project that is still in its preparation stage for the second year, as well as the Marginal Fishing-Community Development Programs (MFCDP) that are still in the preparation stage
Another program is the indirect ADB assistance program that is also aimed at overcoming poverty through developing the capacity of regional governments in financial administration, known as SCBD (Sustainable Capacity Building for Decentralization)
This program began to be prepared in 2005 and is planned for commencement in 2006
There are also assistance programs for the poor from the central government, including Raskin, JPK-Gakin health cards, the improvement program for fishers' housing from the Ministry of Social Affairs, UED-SP, and UP2K that was undertaken until 2001, scholarships for poor students and flood emergency assistance
In connection to access to business capital for the poor, informal businesses, and small to medium-sized enterprises, there are no NGOs providing microfinance services in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah
Microcredit services are provided by BRI and one BPR (Bank Perkreditan Rakyat) that are located in Kota Sibolga
Meanwhile, private banks services are still limited to urban or semi-urban communities
Employees with fixed wages and the non-poor are those that mostly enjoy the loan services of these banks
In the discussions with the community in the PPA villages, the community stated that BRI credit is inaccessible to them
Most capital assistance from the central and regional government in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah is channeled through cooperatives
According to the estimates of the Office of Trade and Investment, there are 290 cooperatives, but 119 are no longer active because they never hold annual members' meetings anymore
Several cooperatives, that are still active and considered to have a good record, have received capital assistance, especially from central government programs, such as from the BBM subsidy program (20 cooperatives received these funds and four of them no longer received them) and capital strengthening assistance for agribusiness cooperatives from the Ministry for Cooperatives and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises
Most members of these cooperatives work as fishers and farmers
Most cooperatives that are still active are general cooperatives that undertake various forms of businesses
Although the performance of most cooperatives is still in question, there is one cooperative located in Kecamatan Pinangsori (Koperasi Dosnitahe) that is developing well
Based on an existing report, this cooperative already has 3,200 members
4.2.2 Poverty Reduction Programs and Policies in Kabupaten Bima
For the Government of Kabupaten Bima and other stakeholders, including donor institutions and international NGOs, poverty reduction is one of the main priorities of the development programs
The poor conditions of natural and human resources, as well as regional isolation, have made poverty a chronic problem of this kabupaten
The Regional Development Program (Propeda) 2000-2005, states that the development vision of Kabupaten Bima during this period is 'The formation of a Bima community and region that is prosperous, autonomous and advanced, based on openness, justice, and democracy, and with the blessings of God
To achieve this vision, the first three points of the mission statements are directly associated with poverty reduction efforts, namely
to create a prosperous community, empower the community and the economic strength of the community, and create the climate for a democratic, high-quality and skillful public education and religious education
Furthermore, enhancing community welfare programs and improving the quality of human resources are also stated as two of the seven regional development programs that are given the highest the priority
Poverty reduction programs that have been and are being undertaken in Kabupaten Bima can be differentiated on the basis of their funding source, i.e the programs funded by the government (APBN/APBD) and by donor institutions
Among the poverty reduction activities funded by APBN/Deconcentration funds are
PDM-DKE (1998-2003), JPS-BK (1998-2003), OPK for Rice (1998-2003), the Clean Water and Environmental Health Project, (2002-2003), the PEMP Program, (2001-2002), Local Economic Program (2000- 2002), Food Security Program (2002-2003), and the Isolated Adat Communities Program (KAT) (2003-ongoing)
There are also programs that are funded by the kabupaten's budget and implemented by individual sectors
One of the poverty reduction programs funded by the government is given in the form of microcredit
Most of these programs experience sustainability problems or even become bad debts
According to several NGOs, the development of small/micro businesses cannot be assessed as being successful
Many people in the community still perceive business capital assistance provided through government programs as a grant
Consequently, many people intentionally do not repay their loans
Because those who do not repay their loans are not sanctioned, this has strengthened the perception of the community that the money from government programs does not need to be repaid
Some of this microcredit is channeled through cooperatives
In Kabupaten Bima, according to the estimate of the Office of Trade and Industry, there are more than 200 cooperatives, 170 of which still conduct their annual members meetings
The government of Kabupaten Bima still uses cooperatives as the means of strengthening the economic condition of the poor and has already allocated approximately Rp2 billion from the APBD for cooperative strengthening programs
Development programs for community business groups through the assistance of the Office of Cooperatives and Microfinance Development, have so far generated as many as 255 KUKM, and 128 KSP/USP/LKM across 14 kecamatan, although their distribution are not equal across villages
According to the estimation of one NGO, however, only around 10 cooperatives are still running well
Compared to Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah, there are relatively more programs in Kabupaten Bima that are funded by donor institutions and international NGOs, including
The IMS-NTAADP Program, World Bank, 1999-2003, which enhanced farming enterprises and value adding activities
Second Water and Sanitation for Low Income Communities (WSLIC-II) Program, World Bank, 1998-2003, which provide potable water and sanitation equipment
The P2D Program of the JBIC, 2002, 2003, which developed physical village infrastructure
The Promis-NT Program, GTZ, BMZ, 1998-2003, which provided guidance for selfreliance community groups, agricultural cultivation, and intensive work programs, as well as participatory planning at the local level
Plan International, Foster Parents from 14 countries, 1998-2003, which provided physical and non-physical infrastructures for the education, health, and environment sectors
Participatory Integrated Development in Rainfed Area (PIDRA), IFAD, 2001- 2008, which supported group formation, enhancement of agricultural production through the conservation and improvement of natural resources, as well as improvement of infrastructure in rural areas
Program for the Expansion of Implementation Systems for the Development of Community Based Forestry, DFID, 2002, 2005, which included planting and seed propagation, and facilitating the PRA methodology to obtain input from the community
Decentralized Agricultural and Forestry Extension Project (DAFED), IBRD 2001, which provided support on food security and agricultural extension
Sustainable Agriculture Program, Veco (Vredeseilanden Country Office Indonesia), 2003-2007, which support the development of village institutions and community groups
Small-scale Fishers-Farmers Income Enhancement Development Project (P4K), World Bank (IBRD), Ministry of Agriculture and BRI Phase I, II, and III, 1998- 2003
Women Health and Family Welfare (WHFK), AusAID, 2002-2006, which support activities in the sectors of women's health and family welfare
Health Program and Iodinization (JP-GAKY), World Bank, 2002-2006
Although there are quite a large number of assistance programs from donor institutions and international NGOs in Kabupaten Bima that have been operating for a long period, they are not found across all kecamatan/villages and are not managed and developed in an integrated way
This situation shows that there is still a lack of coordination between the regional government and donor institutions/international NGOs, as well as lack of capacity in mapping the poverty problem holistically
4.3 The Contribution of the Study to Regional Capacity in Poverty Reduction
Through a series of group discussions at the kabupaten level, this study attempted to raise the issue of poverty and discuss the factors that influence poverty in each kabupaten
It was expected that these discussions would raise awareness and understanding of, as well as attention to the factors that influence the poverty condition in these districts
From the discussions that took place and the issues discussed, it can be observed that there were some changes in the perspective of the stakeholders involved in the series of discussion
For all stakeholders in Kabupaten Bima, the discussion method used in this study was not new to them because they have adopted the participatory development planning approach for the last few years
Nevertheless, the issues that were discussed, especially after the results of the village community discussions in the village-level PPA were presented, has systematically provided input on the various factors and problems that did not arise earlier in the regional development agenda as explained in Chapter III
In contrast, for stakeholders in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah, the participatory discussion method is something new
Because stakeholders, especially from the regional government area are not used to accepting criticism, there was quite a lot of resistance from the associated agencies during the second group discussion when the preliminary results of the village-level PPA were presented
Nevertheless, in the limited discussion group and final workshop at the kabupaten level, it appeared that these agencies became more accommodative and already started to plan alternative policies to overcome these various problems
Although it is not in the scope of this study to observe whether the results of the discussion have been implemented, at least this experience showed that the effort to introduce the participatory approach in a region that has not been exposed to this approach was quite effective in building openness
This experience, however, has inspired several staff of the Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah Bappeda Office to apply this approach in their development coordination meetings
In particular, the results of the PPA have contributed to the improvement of the draft medium and long-term development plan (RPJM and RPJP) of Kabupaten Bima
Because the PPA was undertaken immediately after the election of the bupati and during the refinement of the RPJP and RPJM draft, the preliminary results of the PPA was used as input in this process
In addition, the involvement of several key staff who have joined in the preparation of the RPJP and RPJM document in the PPA study also supported the incorporation of the PPAs results in the refinement of these documents
With direct involvement and experience as members of the PPA Team in the kabupaten, the PPA Team members stated that their understanding and concern of the problems faced by the community have increased
In addition, ideas also emerged on using PPAs in the preparation of planning documents and in the mechanism to improve the implementation of existing participatory development plans, as discussed in Chapter V
Compared with Kabupaten Bima, the contribution of this study in enhancing the poverty reduction plan in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah is not too evident
The political tension and instability tend to undermine the attention stakeholders' pay to the issues of development in general, and poverty in particular
That is why no members of the DPRD attended the discussions held at the kabupaten level
The central government's decision to reject the result of the bupati election that was held in December 2005 also delayed the preparation of the RPJP and RPJM of this kabupaten
Therefore, the results of the PPAs could not yet be used as inputs for these documents
Nevertheless, in the final workshop at the kabupaten level, Bappeda expressed its commitment to address the inputs from the PPA results during the discussions on annual development plans with associated agencies
In addition, several agencies showed positive responses to the criticism and suggestions that had been raised from the results of these PPAs
V THE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING PROCESS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR INTEGRATING PARTICIPATORY POVERTY ASSESSMENTS (PPAs)
At the present time, Law No 25 of Year 2004 on the national development planning system provides the legal base for the planning mechanism, both at the national and regional levels
According to this law, development plans in the regions are set out in the Regional Long-Term Development Plan (RPJPD), Regional Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMD), and the Regional Development Work Plan (RKPD)
Furthermore, the sectoral development plans are set out in the Strategic Plan Regional Level Work Unit (Renstra-SKPD) and Work Plan Regional Level Work Unit (Renja-SKPD)
The Regional RPJM is stipulated in the form of a regional regulation, while the RKPD is set forth in a decree of the head of the region
Based on this new law, the development planning documents are prepared in several phases, one of which is a community consultation on development planning (musrenbang) as described in Figure 8
The musrenbang forum is not something new because a similar forum has been established and implemented in the past as a development consultation (musbang) forum starting from the village level to the kecamatan, kabupaten, province, and national levels
The difference is that the musbang forum in the past only involved government elements, while according to the new law, the musrenbang forum should be conducted in a participatory manner by involving all development stakeholders including
professional associations, higher education, NGOs, adat and religious leaders, as well as the business community
With the involvement of various parties, stakeholders can express their aspirations and this participation will also create a feeling of ownership
Hence, it is expected that this planning system can optimize community participation and so accommodate their interests in the process of formulating development plans
Although the regional development planning process is basically referring to this law, in practice the planning process that has been undertaken in the regions varies
The development planning process in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah is rather different to the process in Kabupaten Bima
This difference occurs because of, among others, the development of a participatory planning process and the relatively high level of NGOs activity in Kabupaten Bima
The discussion below will explain the variation in the development planning process undertaken in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah and Kabupaten Bima
In the following section, there is a discussion on the potential for integrating PPAs in the existing planning process in these two kabupaten
After participating in this study, Bappeda and the Kabupaten PPA Team presented their ideas for integrating the PPA and identified possible constraints
5.1 The Existing Regional Development Planning Process
The development planning process in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah before the establishment of Law No 25 of Year 2004 commenced with a village development consultation (musbangdes), followed by a kecamatan development consultation (musbang), a kabupaten musbang, and was finally discussed and determined by the bupati and the DPRD
Until 2000, the musbangdes was still implemented, and, in fact, the Village Community Empowerment Board (BPMD) had already trained cadres to conduct musbangdes in several kecamatan
Besides preparing a proposal for the development program that will be brought to the kecamatan musbang, the musbangdes forum also discusses the utilization of bangdes (village development) funds for each village
After the implementation of decentralization in 2001, there were no bangdes funds from the APBN and no similar allocations from the APBD to replace these funds
Therefore, the musbangdes activities were no longer organized
Since 2001, the musbang process has been organized starting from the kecamatan level
The kecamatan musbang activity involves delegates from villages in this kecamatan, the PMD office, Bappeda, agencies in the kecamatan, and members of the DPRD being elected for the respective kecamatan
The kabupaten musbang involves delegates from the kecamatan and the local government sectoral agencies
After Law No 25 of Year 2004 was in effect, musrenbang activities in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah continued to be conducted at the kecamatan and kabupaten levels, with more participants compared with the previous musbang forum at the kecamatan and kabupaten levels
Participants in the kecamatan musrenbang were added with representatives from local government sectoral agencies, NGOs in the respective area (if there are any), and local community figures
By directly inviting sectoral agencies, it was expected that the program proposal submitted by sectoral agencies in the kabupaten musrenbang would take into account the kecamatan proposals
Several non-government elements from NGOs and community organizations that are considered relevant were also invited to the kabupaten musrenbang
The kecamatan and kabupaten musrenbang was held around July-August because of the delay in the budget approval by the DPRD
The appointment of the members of the DPRD was also delayed and there was a deadlock in the election of the DPRD head
In Kabupaten Bima, the participatory approach to the development planning process was initiated in 2001 with support from the Promis-NT project
This participatory planning process was formally stipulated in Bupati Decree No 237/2002
After the central government enacted Law No 25 of Year 2004, the regional government of Kabupaten Bima renewed this regulation in the form of Perda No 5 of Year 2005 on the Procedure of Preparing Regional Development Plans in Kabupaten Bima
Based on this regulation, the implementation of the musrenbang in Kabupaten Bima starts from the hamlet/village level
This process was first intensively implemented in Kecamatan Ambalawi and Kecamatan Wera which became the pilot location for the PROMIS-NT
Today it is implemented in all villages and kecamatan in this kabupaten
Based on the results of the village-level musrenbang, programs being proposed are brought to the kecamatan-level musrenbang and then to the kabupaten-level musrenbang
From this series of musrenbang, the Village-Level Government Plan (RPTD), Kecamatan-Level Government Plan (RPTK), and Regional-Level Work Unit Work Plan (SKPD) are prepared
The implementation of this entire participatory planning process has started with the involvement of various nongovernment elements
Through this development planning process, Kabupaten Bima has completed the RPJMD document for 2006-2010 which is stipulated as Perda No 8 of Year 2005, as well as the RPJPD document for 2006-2025 which is stipulated as Perda No 7 of Year 2005
A summary of Kabupaten Bima's planning mechanism which includes the RPJM and RKPD preparation process is presented in Figure 9 below
In addition to the support of PROMIS-NT, development of the planning process in Kabupaten Bima, which is relatively more participatory than in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah, is made possible by the presence of and support from various NGOs, international institutions, higher education institutions and the media (TV and local papers)
These nongovernment elements have already participated in various fields, including advocacy activities and support for activities at the grass-root level, including providing assistance to the poor
The creation of the participatory musbang forum, that later changed into the musrenbang, has provided room for a more intensive participation of these non-government elements in the formulation of regional development plans
The participatory planning system that has been developed in Kabupaten Bima has provided room for a more intensive participation of the stakeholders at the kecamatan and kabupaten levels
However, the implementation of musrenbang at the hamlet and village levels has not provided adequate space for the participation of the whole community, especially the poor
The musrenbang at the village level that are held with the aim of formulating proposals to be submitted to the kecamatan musrenbang, tends to be dominated by the village elites because they are only attended by hamlet representatives, village officials, and community figures
The participatory approach in these musyawarah does not guarantee that the needs and aspirations of the poor will be accommodated sufficiently, as the problems or issues that are considered important by the poor might not be considered important by the village elites who participate in the hamlet and village musrenbang
Irrespective of the differences in the implementation of the planning process in Kabupaten Bima and Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah, they both face the same problems regarding the consistency among the planning results at various levels, and between the results of the planning process and the actual budget
Only a few of the proposals on development plans that have been prepared at the village/kecamatan level can be accommodated in the kabupaten development plan, and even fewer are being funded by the APBD
In the preparation process for development plans at the kabupaten level, there are tensions between the kecamatan's (community's) proposals and the agency's (sectoral's) proposals, and eventually the sectoral's proposals tend to be accepted
Furthermore, in the budgeting stage, the governments of Kabupaten Bima and Tapanuli Tengah, which have a relatively low fiscal capacity, only have limited fund to finance development programs from the APBD
For that reason, the majority of the poverty reduction programs that are running in these two kabupaten, are funded by APBN funds, namely by the deconcentration and co-administration funds
In addition, in Kabupaten Bima there are also many programs funded by assistance from donor countries and international NGOs
Although there are various sources of funding, the fact that only a small number of community proposals that obtain budgetary allocations from the APBD, APBN, and various other sources, have threatened the sustainability of the participatory planning effort that has developed in Kabupaten Bima
Because of this, the community has tended to become rather apathetic in participating in the consultations at the hamlet and village levels
5.2 The Potential of and Obstacles in Integrating PPA into the Planning Process
PPA activities, especially at the village level, that have been jointly held by the kabupaten PPA Team are basically intended to introduce the process and model of participatory discussion with the community, especially the poor
The discussion model is designed to specifically examine the problems of poverty from the perspective of the poor, and also the non-poor community as a comparison
The series of discussion activities, interviews, and direct observations that have been undertaken in these PPA activities were expected to raise awareness on the importance of carrying out efforts to understand the problem from the perspective of the poor, as the subject of poverty reduction programs
Based on the response given by members of the Kabupaten PPA Team, especially those that intensively participated in the PPA training and practice at the village level, it appears that this objective has been achieved
Members of the Kabupaten PPA Team, both those from the government and non-government institutions, were able to see the positive aspects of the process as well as identify the tools used in these PPA activities that have the potential to be developed further
Furthermore, they were also able to identify several obstacles in the application of PPAs in the planning activities that they were undertaking
In general, the members of the Kabupaten PPA Team perceive that the various tools used in the community discussions were very helpful in uncovering the community's perspective and encouraged participants to express their opinion
For that reason, the experience in this PPA has inspired the development of a planning process that is more pro-poor
According to the NGO members of the PPA Team whom often use participatory methods, the strong element of the approach that was used in this PPA was that it was able to deepen the understanding of the factors that influence poverty problems and conditions from the community's perspective
For the members of the PPA Team from the local government, the results of the community discussions that used these tools have already discarded the opinion that the community, especially the poor, cannot express or have great difficulty in expressing their opinion so they do not need to be involved in hamlet or village-level discussions
The experience that was gained during the PPAs in the villages appeared to have shown how this method can help the community, especially the poor, to express their opinion and aspiration
The results of this discussion showed how the poor and non-poor viewed the priorities of the problems they face
Furthermore, the PPA process is considered capable of raising community awareness on the conditions they face and their potential to improve the welfare of their own community
Nevertheless, the PPA Team could see that the PPA process provides the community, especially the poor (both men and women), with the opportunity to be involved and participate in the process of planning, monitoring, and evaluation of development programs and activities
Although members of the Kabupaten PPA Team, in general, recognized the advantages of the tools used in the discussions conducted in this study, they also recognized several obstacles that will emerge if they used these tools in the planning that they will conduct
Among these obstacles mentioned were the large number and difficulty of the FGDs and the ability of the facilitator in using the tools and in understanding the issues in-depth
In the village PPA activities conducted in this study, more than ten types of FGDs were employed with the objective to uncover various aspects of the poverty condition in the community
These were considered as too many and if the aim and issues that were considered necessary to uncover had already been determined, then not all types of FGDs need to be conducted
Therefore, the type of FGDs and the tools used can be selected and limited to relevant issues and the main aims of the discussion activities
On the issue of the facilitators' ability, they were aware that the facilitators' proficiency in using the tools was still inadequate so facilitators were still running a rigid discussion process and procedure
As a result, they were unable to follow the development of the discussions, an ability which is required in order to uncover the issues
To overcome this obstacle, most members of the Kabupaten PPA Team felt that more field practice is needed in the training
In fact, they thought that the PPAs that were undertaken in the three selected villages should have been part of the training activity
Based on the experience acquired during the PPA training and implementation conducted in this study, the members of the PPA Team who were involved in the regional development planning process identified the potential of integrating PPA in the existing development planning process
Generally, members of the PPA Team from Bappeda perceived the PPA methodology is consistent with the participatory approach that is stipulated in Law No 25 of Year 2004
The approach that was undertaken in the PPA will be useful in optimizing the participation of the community, especially poor men and women
In Kabupaten Bima, in particular, the PPA methodology was seen as capable of being integrated into the refinement of Perda No 5 of Year 2005 on the Procedures for the Formulation of Regional Development Planning, especially to ensure the participation of the poor in the participatory process
Thus, in general, PPAs can be integrated in the formulation process of various regional development planning documents, including RPJP, RPJM, RKPD, and Renja-SKPD
The diagram for the integration of PPA in preparation of development plans that was suggested by Bappeda Kabupaten Bima is presented in Figure 10
The diagram shows that PPA can be used for identifying community needs and the results of the analysis can be used for determining issues and formulating specific policies for the long-term (RPJPD), medium-term (RPJMD and Renstra SKPD), as well as annual plans (RKPD and Renja SKPD)
The PPA activity can also become part of the monitoring and evaluation process that is able to assess the level of community satisfaction and the level of fulfillment of community needs
In this study, Kabupaten Bima has used the results of the PPA as input for the preparation of RPJP and RPJM
At the early phase of the study, the Kabupaten Bima Bappeda had already prepared a draft RPJP and RPJM based on the study on past regional development achievements, input from associated agencies, and discussions with stakeholders at the kabupaten level
In the discussions with Bappeda, it was agreed that several staff that are involved in the preparation of RPJP and RPJM would participate in this study and join the PPA Team
Furthermore, the preliminary results of the PPAs would immediately be submitted to Bappeda and the RPJM and RPJP preparation team so they could be used as input for the development of these documents
Thus, the PPA results could become one of the inputs to the finalization of the RPJP and RPJM, in addition to the vision, mission, and program of the elected bupati which was stated publicly in the bupati's election campaign
With regards to the improvement of the musrenbang process at the hamlet/village level, the Bappeda of Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah and Kabupaten Bima, as well as PROMISNT considered that PPAs have a significant potential to become part of the process of gathering information and the implementation of musrenbang at the village level
PPAs will generate more pro-poor stances in musrenbang discussions at the kecamatan and kabupaten levels
For that reason, PPA can be integrated into the annual development planning system and the PPA results can be used as input for the preparation of sectoral agency work plans (Renja), district-level work unit work plans (SKPD), and the preparation of regional government work plans (RKPD)
The proposal of the PPA Team of Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah to integrate PPAs into the annual planning process is presented in Figure 11 below
Although, Bappeda and other stakeholders in Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah and Kabupaten Bima perceive that technically PPA can be integrated into the regional development planning process, in practice there are several challenges to be faced
Amongst the challenges identified, are those associated with
(i) assuring the consistency in the way of perceiving the poverty problem that was put forward at the hamlet/village level with discussions at the kecamatan and kabupaten levels as well as in the budgeting, (ii) the level of representation of the PPA study location with regard to poverty problems in the kabupaten level, and (iii) the need for operational costs and the time to implement the PPA
The issue of consistency between various levels of musrenbang and between the results of the musrenbang and the budgeting process is the greatest structural problem
To overcome this problem, there needs to be commitment from various parties to oversee the planning process, as well as the awareness, involvement, and commitment of regional leaders and members of the DPRD
Regarding the issue of the adequacy of the PPA locations in representing the poverty condition of the kabupaten, both Kabupaten Bima and Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah have already expressed their commitment to conduct PPAs in several other villages in the budget year 2006
In the context of annual planning, however, there are also suggestions to undertake PPAs in all villages on a smaller scale and limiting the types of FGDs to that which are considered most necessary
In connection with this suggestion, it will be necessary to provide training for kecamatan officials who will be given the responsibility to assist or implement PPAs at the village level
This way, it is expected that the operational costs can also be minimized
On the matter of the cost and time needed for the PPA implementation, the support of regional leaders, Bappeda, and all sectoral agencies will be crucial because the PPA results can also be used as inputs for various sectors
VI CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This study was conducted in two districts, namely Kabupaten Bima and Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah, as an effort to enhance the capacity of the district governments in developing a more pro-poor development planning by introducing the PPA method
Although both pilot kabupaten have a high incidence of poverty, they are endowed with different conditions of climate and natural resources, as well as social and political landscape
They also differ with respect to how the planning process is developed and implemented, as well as the presence and activities of non-government organizations and donors
Although these differences do not represent the variations of the conditions of all districts throughout Indonesia, they show the potential variation across districts
The experience in these two distinctive districts has enriched this study
The result of this study has supported the general assumption that efforts to reduce poverty as well as to develop regional government capacity in poverty reduction cannot be homogenized across districts
Thus, such efforts should be adapted and adjusted to local condition
The following section discusses several general conclusions and recommendations drawn from this study
6.1 Poverty Condition and Alternative Policies for Poverty Reduction
The PPA activities and follow up discussions at the kabupaten level has revealed some interrelated problems that affect poverty conditions in the two pilot kabupaten
In Kabupaten Bima, the quantitative data from the statistics office shows a decreasing poverty trend
Indeed, the PPA results in the three villages have pointed out the rise in poverty among wet-rice farmers whose productivity fell because of the water supply shortage, cattle farmers that still adopt traditional techniques, traditional fishers, and shrimp farmers whose ponds are abandoned
In contrast, improved welfare, which also means a decline in poverty, occurred amongst the circles of farmers that have diversified and improved their farming or cattle raising management and technology
The PPA, however, has not included communities in semi-urban areas, so poverty dynamics of these communities are still unknown
In Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah, the quantitative data indicates an increasing poverty trend
The PPA results, however, have identified that welfare improvements were experienced among the farmers who have started diversifying their agriculture business into new plantation commodities, especially palm oil, cacao, and fruits
In addition, the communities around the semi-urban areas whose education levels are relatively high have also tended to have an increase in their level of welfare
In contrast, the welfare level of wet-rice farmers and fishers, who constitute a large proportion of the Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah population, has tended to move downwards
This possibly explains the trend of increased poverty in this kabupaten
In addition, the discussion with various stakeholders at the kabupaten raised the issue of migration from surrounding districts, especially from Nias, that has probably also added to the number of the poor population
However, the areas where the center of the production of rice and fisheries are located and where there are a lot of migrants from other districts, have not yet been included in this PPA activity
While the poverty problems vary across villages and communities, the PPA analysis has identified several major interrelated problems affecting poverty in each district
In Kabupaten Bima, the analysis indicated that there were problems related to
environmental degradation, particularly in forests and steep sloped-land; production and vulnerability of the farming business in its broad sense, including livestock and fisheries; limited employment opportunities; low level of education and skills; inaccessible family planning services; and lack of access to economic and financial institutions
In Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah, the analysis has uncovered issues associated with
decreasing food crops production and fish catch; low level of education among poor families; bad conditions of roads, bridges, and irrigation infrastructures, environmental degradation in river catchment areas and in the sea; and lack of access to family planning
Although the nature of the poverty problems in the two districts are slightly different, in general both share similar problems with regards to environmental degradations, lack of education and skills among the poor, lack of job and business opportunities, and lack of access to capital, as well as very limited community involvement in program/project implementations
Regarding infrastructure condition, the communities in several regions have enjoyed improvements in infrastructure and communication that led to a better welfare condition
Indeed, maintenance remains a big problem in many locations
The PPA findings indicated that infrastructure development together with the introduction of higher value commodities have improved the community's welfare
The welfare improvement is greater than the infrastructure development
In addition, there were lots of non-physical intervention, such as law enforcement and training, extension work,, and technical assistances that appeared to be critical for reducing poverty
These interrelated problems call for a comprehensive approach to reduce poverty and protect against vulnerability
If poverty reduction efforts will be focused around infrastructure developments, it is quite crucial to take into account various factors, including community involvement, starting from the design until the post-construction and maintenance stages, as well as environmental conditions that will affect and be affected by the constructions
In addition, it should be realized that there is a limited ability of infrastructure projects to improve the condition of the poor without supporting efforts that would open up new business or job opportunities for them
More importantly, there is a need for a change in the orientation of public services to one that tends to the needs of the lowest welfare group in the community
PPA results have revealed that there is lack of attention to provision of services to this group
6.2 Enhancing the Capacity of Local Government in Poverty Reduction
This study finds that the interest and capacity of the two district governments in poverty reduction vary
Kabupaten Bima has relatively higher concern over poverty problems than Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah
It is reflected in the activities of the regional poverty reduction committee (KPKD) and the various initiatives to support poverty reduction efforts
The presence and active role of various NGOs and donors, combined with prevalent poverty problem seem to influence the level of awareness and the advancement of poverty reduction initiatives
However, the general knowledge and understanding of poverty among local stakeholders are still limited, although many poverty reduction programs have been implemented
Even for Kabupaten Bima, which has prepared a Regional PRSP draft, the poverty diagnosis in the document still lacks analysis on the multidimensionality of poverty and problems affecting poverty in the region
This has led to a lack of focus on poverty in the programs proposed in the document
Based on this study, below are recommendations in relation to capacity development of local government in poverty reduction
It is necessary to provide district governments and local stakeholders with technical assistances and training that will advance their knowledge and comprehension of the multidimensionality and complexity of poverty
PPAs can serve this purpose
Such assistances could not be delivered in a short period as it should subsequently raise poverty awareness, provide necessary skills to enable governments to involve the poor in poverty analysis, and develop analytical capability for mainstreaming poverty
Improving analytical capability is likely to need special efforts; however, intensive discussions with relevant sectoral agencies and non-government stakeholders carried out in this study were also quite effective in stimulating this analytical skill
To yield real impact, a more long-term engagement (assistance) will be needed
The development of a participatory process is necessary for the PPA process
However, a participatory process does not always provide space for the participation of the poor and does not always guarantee that it will focus on poverty
So it is critical to ascertain that the participatory process is designed to ensure the inclusion of the poor
The forms of assistance should vary depending on the advancement of the district (district government and other stakeholders) on various aspects, including the development of civil society, the development of participatory planning process, and the level of focus and interest to poverty
For districts that have already develop an inclusive and participatory process, the assistance could focus on poverty mainstreaming through PPA process
For districts that have not developed such process, it is necessary to support the poverty mainstreaming (PPA) effort with the development of an inclusive and participatory process
The form of capacity building efforts provided for district governments and the means of providing it should take into account the political conditions of the district, including the neutrality of civil servants, the political tensions, the degree of political intervention to the executive body, and other political processes that are likely to affect poverty reduction efforts
PPA in this kind of district can potentially increase local stakeholders' attention to poverty, although the effort is likely to be harder and takes longer time
6.3 Integrating PPA into the District Planning Process
The two pilot districts have conducted a slightly different development planning process
The observation made during the course of this study shows that among the possible reasons for these differences are the development of civil society, the exposure to participatory approach in planning, and the political condition of the districts
Indeed, the PPA teams in both kabupaten recognize the potential for integrating PPA into the existing development planning process for the long/medium term and annual plannings
Kabupaten Bima has used PPA results as inputs for the finalization of its RPJP and RPJM
This kabupaten also planned to improve its village musrenbang mechanism by incorporating the PPA method
Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah also proposed the use of the PPA approach in the village level musrenbang
The incorporation of PPA as suggested by the PPA teams of Kabupaten Bima and Kabupaten Tapanuli Tengah can become a model for the improvement of the regional planning system
However, there are some challenges in this integration, including
ensuring the consistency in the way of perceiving the poverty problem that was put forward at the hamlet/village level with discussions at the kecamatan and kabupaten levels as well as in the budget; the level of the representation of the PPA study locations with the prevalent poverty problems in the kabupaten level; and the need for operational costs and the time to implement the PPA
The support and commitment of the district government and the legislative body are needed to overcome these challenges
The Social Impact of the Crisis in Indonesia
Results from a Nationwide Kecamatan Survey
Abstract
This paper is based on a qualitative survey of three expert respondents in every kecamatan (sub-district) in Indonesia, 
designed to obtain a quick indication of overall impacts of the Indonesian crisis
Questions cover the degree of different types of impacts (migration, access to health and education, food availability), the frequency of different types of coping strategies (selling assets, reducing frequency of meals, etc), and the most severe impacts in each area
Indices were constructed to measure crisis impact along five dimensions
There are three main findings
First, urban areas have been harder hit by the crisis than rural areas
Second, the impact of the crisis is very heterogeneous, with some regions experiencing great difficulties and others doing relatively well
Both rural and urban areas on Java have been hard hit by the crisis
Some of the other islands, particularly large parts of Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Maluku, have experienced minimal negative crisis impact
Other areas show negative impact, but it is unclear whether problems are economic crisis-related or result from drought (East Timor, NTT, NTB) and fires (East Kalimantan)
Third, there is little connection between initial poverty levels and the extent to which an area has been hit by the crisis, with some relatively poor areas are not hard hit while some relatively well off areas have been quite hard hit
This implies crisis impact targeting and poverty program targeting are two, quite different exercises
The consistency of the results with other quantitative surveys also show that this type of quick turnaround, largely qualitative instrument can give a good overview of degrees of crisis impact in different areas and trends in overall changes
Although results require further validation and cross checking for use in the design of crisis response programs, this kind of survey can point response efforts in the right direction
Because of its low cost and quick turnaround, a similar survey could also be repeated after six months in an effort to provide on-going monitoring of crisis impacts
I Background 
As the economic and political crisis in Indonesia has worsened over the past year, there has been increasing recognition of the need to identify and track emerging problems, with a view to designing appropriate responses
Efforts to monitor social impacts have concentrated on improving or accelerating existing tools, such as the national expenditure survey (SUSENAS) and the village potential survey (PODES)
Although these efforts are crucial for medium-term planning, the time necessary to design instruments, gather, and process data is too long for these instruments to be a useful guide for immediate action
By the time data are processed and analyzed, quickly changing crisis conditions will have rendered them obsolete
Other surveys have focused on measuring impact in specific sectors, such as health and education, and have produced good detailed information for a small number of locations and an indication of trends in these sectors
However, they have not been designed to compare crisis impacts across all of Indonesia and identify areas where overall effects have been most severe
To get a snapshot of changes in overall welfare and emerging problems across Indonesia, the Ford Foundation and the World Bank designed a quick turnaround survey to be implemented in every kecamatan (sub-district)
The purpose of this tool was to give a first indication of overall crisis impacts, the relative severity of various problems in different parts of Indonesia, and an idea of how to target crisis responses most effectively
II Survey and methods 
The Kecamatan Rapid Poverty Assessment was a subjective, expert respondent survey of three government officials in each of Indonesia's 4025 kecamatans
In each sub-district three respondents with kecamatan-wide responsibilities were chosen the agriculture officer (mantri tani) in rural areas or the development officer (kepala seksi PMD) in urban areas; the kecamatan school supervisor (penilik sekolah ); and the health officer (doctor puskesmas)
Each respondent was asked a standard set of questions about changes taking place in the kecamatan as a whole, as well as a set of questions about their professional specialty
The questions asked about the degree of different kinds of impacts (migration, access to health and education, food availability, etc.), the frequency of different types of coping strategies, and the most severe impacts in each area
All questions were designed to measure proportional change in indicators relative to the same time in 1997, to eliminate seasonal changes
The questions asked of all three respondents were qualitative and asked respondents to rate each indicator's severity on a five-point scale
1) somewhat improved; 2) about the same; 3) somewhat worse; 4) much worse; and 5) very much worse
The common questions also included a ranking of problems and three questions on existing crisis response programs
The respondent-specific questions were also primarily qualitative, but included a small number of quantitative questions (which duplicated the topics covered qualitatively)
There are limitations to every approach and the use of subjective qualitative questions is no exception
With the decision to use this type of instrument, the loss of quantitative precision and relying on a very small number of respondents in each location were the price paid for a rapid and nationally comprehensive survey
For this survey, national coverage was necessary in order to identify crisis-hit areas for program targeting
A quantitative survey using representative sampling approach was ruled out as demanding kecamatan sample sizes that are simply too large
By asking for qualitative assessments we hoped to get universal coverage with complete response (the use of quantitative questions did dramatically raise the non-response rate in this survey)
It was also necessary to limit the number of respondents in each kecamatan to minimize the time between survey distribution and return of questionnaires
Inter-respondent reliability
One concern about using the expert respondent qualitative approach is the inter-respondent reliability
Simply put, do two people asked the same question about the same kecamatan tend to give the same answer
Since 21 questions of this survey were general questions that all three respondents answered, we can assess this inter-respondent reliability of the responses by comparing responses
Appendix 2 details the outcome of three different measures
the correlation across different respondents; within versus across kecamatan analysis of variance; and the average absolute deviation
All three approaches show an acceptable degree of consistency in response patterns within kecamatan but also show that there is a significant level of disagreement between respondents
The correlations across kecamatans of the responses of any two of the coders from the same kecamatan seldom rise above 0.3 and some cases are closer to 0.2
The average absolute disagreement between two respondents in the same kecamatan (on a scale from 1 to 5) is between 0.6 and 0.8
While this disagreement is relatively small in an absolute sense, the total variation of the responses is also quite small (standard deviations vary between 0.9 and 1.2)
The within kecamatan sums of squares (that part of the variation in the data that arises from disagreements amongst the respondents in the same area) is generally on the order of one-third to one-half of the total variance
This degree of uncertainty serves as a warning to confine analysis to comparisons where we can realistically hope that "signal" will overshadow "noise" 
This means either using aggregates of kecamatan (e.g provinces or kabupaten and kotamadya) and aggregates of variables
Also, between kecamatan gross distinctions are fairly reliable but fine distinctions (e.g between "about the same" and "slightly worse") should be made with extreme caution
It should be noted that these limitations imply that, while the broad patterns indicated by this data are useful in targeting of crisis response, used on their own these data alone cannot target program locations at the kecamatan level
Index construction
There are too many questions in the survey to do a detailed analysis of each
Instead, summary indices were constructed from a combination of indicators in each of five dimensions
The construction of each impact index involves several steps
a) choosing variables with sufficient internal reliability and creating a single kacamatan response; b) dividing the reliable variables into five categories
1) use of coping strategies in response to crisis impacts; 2) food security; 3) employment; 4) education; 5) health; and c) assigning appropriate weights to chosen variables within each category
Using the chosen variables in each category, we applied the principal components technique to summarize the "signal" contained in a set of variables dealing with a common topic
The first principal component of the set of variables for each category, which is that linear combination of all the variables which captures the most common variation in all the variables, was used as the impact index for each category
The variables included in the principal components analysis for each index were
* Coping
There were ten questions about coping strategies and reduced involvement in community activities, such as the change in selling animals or consumer durables and change in the participation and contributions to arisan and ceremony activities
* Food Security
This index combined nine questions on food security, including population reducing the quantity and quality of food consumption, population unable to afford the staple food, and indications of malnutrition
* Employment
This combined seven individual variables about the fraction of people working more hours, the number of family members working, migration movements of males and females, and local business conditions
* Education
The education index combined nine questions from the school official about enrollments and drop-outs at the primary level, and about parental contributions and teacher attendance
* Health
Seven questions from the doctor puskesmas about patient visits, purchasing power for medicines, availability of medicines and contraceptives and quality of services were used for the health index
This health index was the most disappointing as the common component of the responses was too small to make the index of much value added over the individual questions
For this reason we do not include the maps for health below
III Provincial and Kabupaten Analysis
Regional Heterogeneity and Urban- Rural Differences The indices were used for two stages of analysis; one at the provincial level, distinguishing rural from urban areas, and another at the district level that distinguishes between rural kabupaten (districts) versus kotamadya (municipalities)
There are three results that come through very clearly from the analysis at both levels
1) urban areas have been much harder hit than rural areas by the crisis; 2) there is enormous heterogeneity in the impact of the crisis with some areas suffering enormously while others appear to be absolutely better off
Three prominent patterns emerge
Java is hard hit, even in rural areas, most likely because of a high degree of integration between urban and rural areas; Some of the other islands, particularly large parts of Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Maluku, have experienced minimal negative crisis impact; Other areas show negative impact, but it is unclear whether problems are economic crisis-related or result from drought (East Timor, NTT, NTB) and fires (East Kalimantan)
3) There is little connection between initial poverty and the magnitude of the shock, with many of the areas hardest hit were the relatively well-off areas that had booming modern economy sectors pre-crisis
A Provincial analysis 
Within each province the values for urban and rural kecamatan are aggregated separately
This produces 51 regions (two for each of 25 provinces and one for DKI Jakarta, which has no rural kecamatan)
These are then sorted by level of impact (see Table 1)
The rankings for each of the five indices are shown in Table 1, 
for urban and rural areas by province using standard area abbreviations (e.g Kaltim in boldface type is urban East Kalimantan, while the rural area of the same province is shown in italics)
The same areas are also sorted by an overall impact index based on the average of the rankings of three indices (food security, employment, and coping)
According to the average crisis impact index, the single hardest hit region is urban East Kalimantan while urban Bengkulu is the least hit
Comparing the 40% hardest hit provinces and 40% least hit provinces reveals very clearly that urban areas are, on average, much harder hit than rural areas
Of the 20 hardest hit areas, 14 are urban, 
while of the 20 least hit areas, 13 are rural
Notably, all areas of Java are included in the 20 hardest hit areas, regardless of urban/rural status
The only other rural areas included in the 20 most affected areas are East Kalimantan and Aceh
The urban areas that fall into the least hard hit 40% are those in provinces where rural areas are also relatively unaffected, such as Jambi, South Sumatra, Bali, North Sulawesi, Central Sulawesi, Maluku, and Bengkulu
These results imply that the crisis impacts are concentrated in urban areas and on Java
Also, some of the eastern provinces have experienced substantial negative impact in both urban and rural areas
Important exceptions are urban areas in provinces that produce export crops or other foreign exchange earning activities (such as tourism)
Likely explanations for this regional pattern include the higher integration of rural and urban areas on Java so that a modern sector crisis (e.g originating in the banking and corporate sector) would spillover more, the recent drought in Eastern Indonesia, and the higher rupiah incomes (due to the currency depreciation) earned from export crops in regions that escaped the recent drought
Since the principal components analysis produces index numbers that are both rescaled (to have a mean of zero) and are a complicated aggregate of a variety of indicators it is difficult to make statements about the absolute magnitude of changes
While we can say which are the least hit areas it is difficult to say whether this means they are absolutely better off than a year ago or whether their absolute living standards had deteriorated, but just by less than other areas
However, looking at the cross tabulation on specific questions does suggest some areas are absolutely better off than a year ago
Table 2 chooses just one question about the change in the population selling household goods to meet basic needs broken down into provinces, and by rural and urban
This table shows the fraction of kecamatans in these areas that reported that, by this indicator, things were worse (any one of the three possible responses for severity)
For hard hit area in table 1 by the coping index, the fraction reporting worse on this question is very high, such as 93% in urban Aceh, 87.5% in urban West Java, 82.5% in rural west Java
In contrast, of the areas reported as least hard hit by the coping index only a small fraction reported things were worse
For instance in rural Bengkulu in only 16.7% of kecamatans were asset sales worse while in rural Maluku only 26.1% of kecamatan reported things were worse
In fact, less than half the kecamatan reported asset sales were worse in the rural areas of 12 provinces
North Sumatra, West Sumatra, Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, Bengkulu, Lampung, East Timor, West Kalimantan, West, Central and South Sulawesi
B Kabupaten Level Analysis 
In this analysis we distinguish between rural and urban areas on the basis of kabupaten and kotamadya
Kabupaten and kotamadya were ranked according to the impact indices and divided into quintiles
We do two types of analysis, a visual analysis of the maps and a statistical comparison of the proportions of various areas falling into the various quintiles of severity
Maps of crisis impact
Quintiles were then mapped to show the spatial distribution of crisis impact
Figure 1 shows maps for four indicators
1a
Coping, 1b
Food security, 1c
Employment , and 1d
Education
Figure 1
Kabupaten level crisis impacts on food, coping strategies, employment and education These maps tell a very clear story, most striking in the index of coping (which is an index driven mainly by asset sales and reduced participation in community activities)
On the nationwide map there are five areas that are in the bottom quintile
West Java and parts of Central Java, Urban areas (the kotamadya appear as dark spots on all islands, even more clearly on the insert Java-Bali Map) NTT and parts of Tim-Tim Scattered areas of West and North Sumatra (Aceh) A huge (but sparsely populated) area of Kalimantan 
In contrast the unshaded areas, which are the top quintile, shows Wide parts of Sumatra, Sulawesi, Maluku, and Bali are among the least hard hit
No part of Java is in the top fifth, or least hit category
These same broad patterns show up in the other general crisis indicators
The employment index shows that in employment terms is an even more island of Java (and with more rural kabupaten hit hard) and urban crisis, with a few exceptions in Sumatra
Interestingly, an important element of the employment impact index is people returning to their village
This means that unempoyment per se is not measured and that some areas from which people are migrating are equally hard hit as the nearby receiving areas
This is perhaps why more rural parts of Java and Bali appear hard hit on employment, as a spill over from Java
The food security map, which is driven by indicators of eating fewer and lower quality meals, tells again a Java and urban story but with a couple of twists
First, on this index NTT and TimTim show up as much worse hit than by coping or employment 
this is an indication of the natural environment dimensions of the problem
Second, parts of West Java and especially the Jabotabek area appear much less hard hit on this dimension, which is likely due to the fact that initial incomes were much higher and hence selling assets would take prominence over reducing food intake as a coping mechanism
That is, since the food security index captures not just food production but also lowering food intake, the crisis in richer areas (like Jabotabek) will show up more clearly in selling assets, which is a first resort for those that have them, and only later in food intake declines
Statistical analysis
Examining the hardest hit 40% of tingkat II (district level) clearly reinforces the provincial level results
Kotamadyas have generally been more severely hit than rural kabupatens
For both coping and employment indices, 60% of kotamadyas are in the hardest hit 40% of tingkat II, compared to only 38% of rural kabupatens
For the food index, similar proportions of kotamadyas and kabupatens are ranked in the hardest hit 40% (41% of kabupaten versus 45% of kotamadya)
Again, as with the provincial results, areas on Java show a different pattern
Both kabupatens and kotamadyas are classified in the two hardest hit quintiles (see map where most of areas on Java falls into the categories of hardest hit (black), especially for coping and employment
Moreover, the coping index for West Java shows that 65% of the tingkat II in the province fall in the worst hit quintile, while an additional 20% are in the second quintile
Five of the six kotamadyas in the province are in those two quintiles, as well as 85% of the rural kabupatens
East and Central Java, as well as DI Yogyakarta, are also experiencing similar patterns
C Has the crisis hit the poorest areas
It is important to remember that the kecamatan survey measures only changes in welfare (and that qualitatively)
The results of the survey indicate relative shifts since the crisis began, but are not able to show current absolute welfare or standard of living levels
A question as yet unanswered is whether the crisis hit hardest in areas that were already poor, making them even worse off, or whether the impact has been more severe in relatively well-off areas
A simple correlation test between various indices and pre-crisis levels of the incidence of poverty based on SUSENAS 1993- 1996 across kecamatans reveals very little correlation, statistically insignificant even with 3,900 observations
The same lack of association between pre-crisis poverty and the magnitude of the crisis impact can be seen by comparing the figures which show changes due to the crisis to the pre-crisis poverty levels
Figure 2 which shows the proportion below the standard poverty line in each kabupaten, using SUSENAS data averaged from 1993 and 1996
While most of West Java, and especially the area around Jakarta, have very low poverty rates, the crisis has been enormous in those areas
In contrast, Maluku, with very high poverty rates, has perhaps even benefited from the crisis
Figure 2
Pre-crisis poverty levels (SUSENAS 1993-1996) The fact that severity of crisis impact does not correlate with pre-crisis conditions makes the design of poverty and crisis response instruments extremely complicated because pre-crisis poverty data can not be relied upon for target responses to the crisis
First, some areas which were not poor have been hit relatively hard and may now be poorer than other areas
Second, what is even more complicated is that many previously well off regions (e.g Jabotabek) have been hit very hard, but almost certainly have not reached the level of absolute poverty of traditionally poor areas
In this case, targeting the crisis impact is not the same as targeting absolute poverty
Needless to say, this creates considerable tensions between the long-term development programs, which have traditionally been aimed at bringing mainly remote and rural areas into the mainstream of growth, and crisis and emergency programs, which will be targeted to urban and rural areas which were, until the crisis, relatively better off and booming
Table 3 illustrates various mixes of crisis effects and pre-crisis poverty levels relatively well-off and hard hit (e.g
Jabotabek), relatively poor and hard-hit (e.g NTT), relatively poor and not hard hit (e.g Maluku), and relatively well-off and not hard hit (Bali)
IV Specific crisis impacts 
Beyond the regional heterogeneity of the overall crisis impact there are also regional differences in the various dimensions of the crisis
For some areas the crisis is mainly an economic crisis feeding through labor markets, while in other areas there is a food security crisis driven by natural conditions
Moreover, people who begin from different absolute levels of income will have different responses to the crisis
For instance, middle class families will respond to a shock by working more, reducing consumption, drawing down savings, and selling assets, but are unlikely to pull children from primary school or suffer malnutrition
In contrast, people near absolute poverty may not have the luxury of these coping strategies so an equally large shock will force them into more drastic measures, such as primary school drop-out and reduced food intake
An examination of how the various indices differ across locations gives some clues to these effects
Result of different indices across locations is presented in Table 3
A Food security 
As Table 3 shows, the impact of the crisis on food availability has been more severe in urban areas
Further, the hardest hit rural areas are either on Java or in Eastern Indonesia
These findings are consistent with preliminary data reported by IFLS2+
Real per capita expenditures in rural areas have risen in both mean and median
Meanwhile, in urban areas the mean real per capita household expenditures has fallen by around 40 percent (although median incomes fall by much less, suggesting a larger proportionate compression in expenditures mainly in the richer half of the distribution)
Combined with higher food prices, urban dwellers are therefore suffering from sharply reduced purchasing power
In Eastern Indonesia, food security problems are the results of last year's drought
Other data also project severe food shortages in Eastern Indonesia, especially for maize, cassava, sweet potato, and taro
[see Garcia Garcia and Sean Foley, Nov 1997] 
In addition, individual variables from the survey reveal the following
Increased price of rice - Not surprisingly, half of the respondents indicated that the price of rice has increased by more than 50%
This result is in line with price reports from around the country
The general CPI from May to September 1998 has increased more than 50% and increases in the rice price have outpaced general CPI
Reduced availability of basic food stuffs - The mean response to the question of changes in availability and accessibility of staples has changed since last year indicates that there has been a more dramatic worsening in food security, a combination of availability and affordability compared to other indicators
Reasons behind scarcity of staples include breakdowns in distribution systems and decreased output in droughtstruck areas
B Employment and wages 
The impact of the crisis on labor markets and access to economic activity has been more severe in urban areas and in Java (Table 1)
Four of the seven provinces in the hardest hit rural areas are on Java
The finding that NTB is hardest hit in terms of employment impact is also consistent with preliminary results from IFLS2+, that show that almost 15% of males working in 1997 had lost their jobs in August 1998 (Rand
Measuring Change in Indonesia, 1998, p 9)
Individual survey variables show the following
Return migration of males - Both urban and rural kecamatans reported a greater than normal in-flow of males, returning because they lost their jobs elsewhere
This result indicates that there is not necessarily a consistent flow of unemployed urban dwellers to rural areas or vice versa
In contrast, there has been a smaller increase in the number of women that have returned to the kecamatan compared to the previous year
The data showed less out migration
Increase in nominal agricultural wages and output prices - More than 85% of the mantri tani reported that wages had increased for hoeing
Responses also indicate that there has been a less dramatic increase in harvesting wages
These imply that while assumption of no change in nominal income are far off the mark, given of the data about price changes suggest there have been substantial real wages declines in many areas
However, on the revenue side, there has been an intermediate increase in nonrice output prices
Mantri tani responses also point to some increase in farm profitability (more than 50% answered that farm profits had increased compared to last year, although the mean response was no change), 
indicating that increases in output prices have outweighed rising labor costs in some areas
C Education 
As discussed above, analysis of survey results indicate that urban areas have been harder hit than rural areas, according to the indices constructed
The exception is the education index, for which 12 of the twenty hardest hit areas are rural
In terms of the least hit twenty areas, only six are rural
Although the individual responses showed that dropout rates have been low, the index points to some problems in rural areas
One possibility is that the increase in agricultural wages raises the opportunity cost of schooling in rural areas, making it more attractive to pull children out of school
Another possibility is that rural families are nearer the margin so that an equi proportionate shock to incomes will cause more rural than urban families to withdraw children from school
For the individual variables, all respondents indicated that taking children out of primary school was not a common response to crisis impacts
This result is further reinforced by the responses given by the school supervisors to the sector specific questions almost 85% indicated that there had been no change or a reduction in the number of students that dropped out between Kelas 3 and 4
On average, school supervisors also indicated no change in the overall level of dropouts during the last school year (compared to the preceding year) or in the numbers of girls and boys that entered Kelas 1 this school year (compared to last year)
However, for the latter, the distribution of answers is skewed towards a decrease in first-year enrollment rates, indicating that parents may be delaying school starts for younger children while letting older children continue
D Health 
As shown in Table 3, the impact of the crisis on health is more equally distributed between rural and urban areas
Twelve of the twenty hardest hit areas are urban, and 11 of least hit provinces are also urban
However, the health index is consistent with the other indices in that Java has been severely affected
Except for DKI Jakarta, the four other provinces on Java are in the 20 hardest hit provinces
The responses by the dokter puskesmas show that magnitudes of increases in prices and reduced availability of contraceptives are greater than most of the other impacts included in the survey
The distribution of answers indicates that higher prices may be a bigger problem than availability
E Ranking of problems 
Respondents were asked most to least severe crisis impacts from a list of eight potential problems
From these we identified as priority these ranked in the top 3 of the 8
Response patterns suggest some fairly strong and consistent opinions about what crisis impacts have been most severe
For example, the relatively high ranking of unemployment (particularly in urban areas), finding staple food and loss of income can be compared with the relatively low ranking of education or health impacts (see Table 5)
Overall the loss of the real purchasing power of incomes, which is a combination of less employment and rising prices of staples, is the predominant concern
F Comparison with Other Studies 
These are three other surveys which are producing preliminary results comparing pre and post crisis levels of impact The Indonesia Family Life Surveys (IFLS) 2+, the 100 villages surveys and a recent survey of schools
None of these have nationwide coverage so the comparison of the results is difficult
But the main result of the kecamatan survey are largely consistent with preliminary data from other surveys
Estimates of mean expenditures for rural and urban areas from the IFLS2+ show that mean per capita household expenditures in rural areas have increased in the past year, while those in urban areas have fallen by almost 40%
UNICEF's 100 Village survey also shows that ownership of durables has increased in rural areas, 
which reinforces the conclusion that urban areas have been more severely affected across the board
The IFLS2+ survey shows that primary enrolment has increased for both girls and boys in urban and rural areas, which is consistent with the result that dropout rates have remained the same or dropped slightly
Result from a very recent survey of school carried out by the World Bank and Ministry of Education and Culture also reveals that overall enrollments at the primary level do not appear to be deviating from their past trend and fell by only 1.5% in 1998/99, about average from previous four years
The survey also shows that urban Central Java, urban Maluku, and Jakarta experienced significant declines of junior secondary level, while rural South Sulawesi saw an 8% increase
V Conclusions and Recommendations 
Of course this survey reconfirms the obvious, that Indonesia's population is experiencing enormous social impacts from a severe economic and financial crisis
But what is new is empirical evidence at a national level that suggests the crisis impact is very heterogeneous both between urban and rural areas and across regions
Some regions have been hard hit, others are relatively less affected and some are even booming
Ranking of urban and rural areas according to indices of crisis impacts shows that, in general, crisis impacts have been more severe in urban areas
For four of the five indices, the concentration of urban areas in the twenty hardest hit is considerably higher than the concentration of rural locations (12-15 out of 20)
Likewise, the number of rural areas in the twenty least affected areas is higher for the food security, coping strategy, and employment indices (11-15 out of twenty)
Second pattern is that both urban and rural areas on Java have been hard hit by the crisis
All areas of Java rank within the top twenty (of 51) most hard hit regions for the overall impact index (and within or close to the twenty worst affected for the other indices)
Other areas that consistently turn up close to the top of the ranking are urban areas in East Kalimantan, West Kalimantan, North Sumatra, DI Aceh, Lampung, NTB, NTT, and East Timor
At the other end of the scale, some provinces seem to have felt relatively little impact of the financial crisis in both urban and rural areas
Notably, North Sumatra, Bengkulu, Central Sulawesi, and Maluku fit into this category
In addition, rural areas in South Sulawesi, Jambi, and Riau also consistently rank among the twenty least affected
Designing specific programs that respond to the crisis is complicated and must balance several objectives, 
but this data at least suggest that crisis response efforts should therefore target urban centers, in general, and particularly those that have had the relatively largest drops in welfare levels, such as urban areas in East and West Kalimantan, North Sumatra, DI Aceh, Lampung, NTB, NTT, and East Timor
Both rural and urban areas on Java should be included in crisis programs
It is important to note that the magnitude of crisis impacts does not correlate with pre-crisis levels of poverty
This result points to the need to reassess data and assumptions about poverty distributions
While difficult to draw in practice, there is a analytical distinction between targeting for the critical targeting long term poverty programs
In designing longer term poverty interventions there is a deeper, and resolved, question of whether the crisis has changed fundamental dynamics and hence calls for a rethinking of long-term poverty programs or is merely a temporary shock
In terms of the kinds of interventions that should be designed for the crisis this requires more detailed analysis of the cost-effectiveness in practice of various types of interventions
But there appears a need for continued efforts to channel rice and other basic foods to needy areas, workfare programs in urban areas, efforts to maintain health services, provision of free or subsidized contraceptives, and continuation of the scholarship program
The consistency of the results with other surveys also show that this type of quick turnaround, largely qualitative instrument can give a good overview of degrees of crisis impact in different areas and trends in overall changes
Although results require further investigation for design of crisis response programs, this kind of survey can point response efforts in the right direction
Because of its low cost and quick turnaround, a similar survey could also be repeated after six months in an effort to provide on-going monitoring of crisis impacts across Indonesia
Appendix 1
Survey design and implementation The survey was distributed through the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) existing network of mantri statistik, who represent BPS at the kecamatan level
The mantri statistik are present in almost every kecamatan and their regular responsibilities include maintaining and updating population, education, and other local data bases
The survey was sent to the BPS office at the kabupaten level, where mantri statistik from each kecamatan picked them up along with instructions to implement the survey and return it to the kabupaten office within a week
Completed surveys were mailed back to BPS headquarters for data entry and processing
Total turnaround (including administering the survey and processing the data) was approximately one month
Analysis took place over a three week period
In rural areas, the three respondents were
mantri tani -- As the kecamatan representative for the Ministry of Agriculture, the mantri tani supervises all agricultural extension workers and, through them, gets regular reports on agricultural production, areas planted, and farm technologies used throughout the kecamatan
dokter puskesmas -- The dokter puskesmas is the head of the kecamatan health center and sees patients from different parts of the kecamatan
Some dokter puskesmas also pay regular visits to the smaller supporting health centers in the sub-district
penilik sekolah -- The penilik sekolah , or school supervisor, meets regularly with principals and teachers from across the kecamatan
In urban areas, the mantri tani was replaced by the Kepala Seksi PMD, who is in charge of coordinating development activities for the kecamatan
In the instructions accompanying the questionnaire, the respondents were asked to consult with their colleagues (i.e., agricultural extension worker, nurses and midwives, and principals/teachers) before completing the questionnaire to ensure that answers were representative of the kecamatan as a whole
Appendix 2
Inter-coder reliability Although responses from different respondents in the same kecamatan will never completely coincide, a large amount of within-kecamatan variation relative to that found to exist between kecamatan will indicate a level of noise (as opposed to signal) in the response patterns that calls for caution in interpreting summary indicators at the kecamatan level
To be able to compare values of the phenomena being measured, we should determine the degree to which responses from the three groups of respondents are the same
This internal reliability testing was carried out in the following ways
a) testing the degree of correlation between each of the three respondents on each of the common questions; b) decomposing the total variance into that across coders (respondents) and across kecamatan; and c) an analysis of systematic differences in central tendency across the three type of respondents
Results of various measures of internal reliability test are presented in Table 6, Table 7 and Table 8
Table 6 shows correlation coefficients between each of the three respondents on each of the common questions (except for Question 15)
Table 7 applies one-way ANOVA to break down between- and within-kecamatan contributions to variance
Table 8 shows average response deviations within kecamatan, the sum of the absolute differences of responses within each kecamatan divided by the total number of kecamatan
Appendix 3
Principal components analysis Appendix 4 lists all variables included in the survey and Tables 8a-e indicates those that contributed to the construction of each index
Note that, due to relatively high levels of non-response on many of the quantitative questions, we exclude those variables for index construction
Five indices were constructed
an index of food availability/accessibility (IND_FD); an index of employment impact (IND_EMP); an index of education impact (IND_EDU); an index of health impact (IND_HLT); and an index of community impact and coping mechanisms (IND_COPT)
Tables 9a-9e show results of the principal component analysis, and Table 10 shows correlation matrix among the five indices
As can be seen from the tables, the first three best indices were IND_FD and IND_COPT, followed by IND_EMP
Variables in food availability/accessibility are strongly weighted toward those reflecting difficulties in purchasing an adequate diet of staple foods
Variables in coping reflect community and individual level adjustments (such as reduction in participation of community activities and selling of households assets)
Recent studies on education service delivery, including the World Development Report 2004 published by the World Bank, have begun to focus on the problem of teacher absenteeism
This report provides an overview of the results of a survey on primary education services in Indonesia, focusing on teacher absentee rates and the impact on student learning processes
This survey is the first detailed study on the phenomena of teacher absenteeism in Indonesia obtained from two unannounced visits to 147 sample schools in October 2002 and March 2003
The survey shows that the teacher absence rate in Indonesia is approximately 19%
This number is considerably higher than that of other developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America
Teacher absence is related to individual and workplace characteristics such as education levels, poverty rates, and the location of schools
We found that teacher absenteeism is statistically significant and negatively correlates with the performance of their students
This report also identifies several relevant and important policy recommendations to reduce the teacher absence rate, such as the adequacy of a school's physical facilities, teacher employment status, and a monitoring system
Yet, as many as 100 million children worldwide do not have access to primary education (UNESCO, 2002)
Most of them live in the developing world and the majority are female
In 1984 the Indonesian government made six years of education compulsory, 
which was expanded in 1994 to nine years of compulsory education, with a target that all children aged 7 to 15 years would receive a basic education
However, efforts to achieve this target have been hindered by many obstacles, such as lack of qualified teachers, adequate school buildings, and textbooks
This report contains an overview of the survey results on primary education services in Indonesia, focusing on teacher absence rates and its impact on the learning performance of students
This survey was conducted in 10 districts/cities, randomly selected but taking into account the population in four Indonesian regions Java-Bali, Sumatera, Kalimantan-Sulawesi, and Nusa Tenggara
The survey is the first comprehensive study on the phenomena of teacher absenteeism in Indonesia and was conducted in two unannounced visits to all sampled schools in October 2002 and March 2003
A teacher was considered as absent if at the time of the visit the researcher could not find the sample teacher in the school
In Indonesia there are two primary educational systems, either administered by the Ministry of National Education (Depdiknas) or the Ministry of Religious Affairs (Depag)
Depdiknas regulates Primary Schools (SD) and Middle Schools (SMP) using a general education curriculum
Depag manages Madrasah Ibtidaiyah (MI) and Madrasah Tsanawiyah (MTs) using a mixed curriculum that teaches both general and Moslem-related subjects
This report aims to analyze the results of the survey on the teacher absence phenomena among full-time public primary school teachers
A similar survey, with the same methodology and timeframe, was conducted in seven other countries Bangladesh, Ecuador, India, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Zambia and Uganda
Survey results showed that with a teacher absence rate of 19%, Indonesia ranked third among these eight countries after Uganda (39%) and India (25%)
In Indonesia, 45% of these absences were without any clear reason, 36% were either because of illness or official leave, while the remaining 19% were due to the teacher conducting official duties outside of the school, such as attending meetings or participating in a training session
Teacher attendance lists were not reliable sources of teachers attendance in schools, 
since only 59% of those present signed the attendance list
Teachers usually sign the attendance list before they go home or at times, sign the list for the full week at once
Absent teachers tend to be males, with a relatively high education level, and as contract/temporary teachers
Other factors contributing to teacher absences were lack of adequate transportation, the absence of the headmaster, lack of toilet facilities, and poor quality of school facilities in general
Teacher absence rates in schools can have negative effects on student learning processes
This is less of a problem for those living in cities since normally, substitute teachers are always available
However, in rural areas, especially in remote areas, teacher absences may become a more serious problem because substitutes are not always available
Therefore, when a teacher is absent, two classes often have to be merged into a single class or a teacher will have to teach two classes in different rooms, or the teacher is substituted by a senior student
In many cases, students were sent home when their teacher was absent
These have had negative impacts on the students' learning abilities
According to the mathematics and language tests administered to fourth-grade students in this survey, the scores of rural students were generally lower than that of students from cities
The proportion of rural students receiving a grade below 50% in their math test doubled that of those from urban areas
This figure tripled for the language test
The learning abilities of the students in general positively correlate with the teachers' tenure
They positively correlate when the teacher per student ratio is less than 1:25, but they become negatively correlated when the ratio is higher than 1:25
Student learning abilities were negatively correlated when their teachers had other outside jobs or if the teachers were female
Female students generally have significantly higher learning abilities than male students
However, this fact could be considered more as a problem than a success, due to the following factors
First, the push to increase educational opportunities for female students has indirectly ignored male students
Second, students learning at home were normally assigned to their mothers, which cause male students to lose the father figure (which is made worse if most of the teachers at the school were female)
The results of this survey reveal that the grades of a student's mathematics and language tests were positively correlated with their mother's formal educational background, but they were not correlated with their father's formal educational background
The above conditions require a response from the government and the community, especially officials from Districts/Cities Department of Education, to conduct an evaluation on education-sector policies
Teacher' welfare needs to be increased and there needs to be special financial incentives for teachers who work in poor remote areas
There needs to be stricter management of monitoring activities in order to prevent corrupt and collusive activities
Teacher placement needs to be properly reexamined and adjusted, both in terms of quality and quantity, and between schools in rural areas and cities
The placement of experienced teachers should not be limited to schools in the cities
In addition, supporting facilities for learning activities need to be allocated more equally between urban and rural areas
Rural schools, especially in poor areas, provide hope for the poor population for a better livelihood for their future generation
A Response of the International Community on Primary Education
Chapter 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that primary education should be made available at no charge for all children and their participation should be made compulsory, while secondary education should be made open to all children on the base of achievement
At least during the past few decades, the international community has increasingly realized that the development of primary education could become a primary strategy to reduce global poverty by half within one generation
For instance, the meeting of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in its 2000 meeting in Dakar, Senegal, agreed that at least by the year 2015, all primary-school age children must have a chance to enroll in a primary education institution at no charge, with adequate educational instructions, and with the elimination of all discrimination between male and female students
This is a global commitment
Every country is responsible for achieving these goals within their own borders, and the international community is responsible to make sure that no country lacks the necessary labor and funds to achieve this goal
Such responsibility is highlighted to address the problem of more than 100 million children worldwide who are unable to enjoy primary education
Most of these children live in the developing countries and the majority are female
If the goal to reduce global poverty is to be achieved, other conditions outside of education must also be improved, such as
improvement of health facilities, provision of clean water and sanitation
In addition, there needs to be investments in technological improvement in various strategic sectors for human development
Finally, successful education development would also depend on appropriate implementation of educational policies, including provision of adequate incentives for teachers
B What are the Policies and Conditions of Primary Education in Indonesia
The political will of the Indonesian government in providing primary education services to its entire people remains strong
Article 31 of the 1945 Indonesian Constitution states that all citizens have the right to primary education and are required to have primary education
It is the government's responsibility to fund this
Through a recent amendment to this article this commitment was strengthened by a requirement that the government must allocate at least 20% of its national budget to the education sector
The same percentage was also mandated for each region in their local government budget to help meet the need of national education
In the new National Educational System passed in 2003 (Law No 20/2003), it is stated that the 20% minimum requirement does not include teacher education and local education department training needs
The government provides education services in order to prepare for the future and to improve quality of life and the general welfare of its people
In practice, however, this commitment (especially for primary education) is facing many obstacles, such as difficulties in providing adequate teachers, school buildings, textbooks, and operational funding
As a result, the rights and responsibilities of citizens to receive and participate in primary education has not been fully accomplished
This is more problematic for poor citizens
In various poor and isolated areas they face the biggest obstacles in receiving primary education, and in many cases, have no access to this service at all
Even if primary education services are available, the poor can not afford them or the quality of the provided education is substandard
The low quality of public services, especially primary education services, is usually related to a lack of accountability, low public participation, and weak government policy (World Bank, 2003)
In 2001/2002, the number of Indonesian children aged 7 to 12 years old that were not enrolled in primary school was about 6% of all primary school-age children (1,448,776 children) (Research and Development Bureau, Ministry of National Education, 2003)
However, even when the real participation rate at primary school level is considered to be high, UNESCO (2002) categorized Indonesia as a country that has a lower real participation rate
This is because a decrease of the real participation rate by 1% means that more than 240,000 of school-age children between the age of 7 to 12 in Indonesia are no longer enrolled in primary schools
A classic problem faced by the primary education system in Indonesia is the lack of teachers, unequal distribution of teachers, and poor quality of teachers
As a result, the learning process is unable to function properly and as a result, quality of student learning is low (ILO, 2004)
Teachers play a very important role in primary education and any absence of teachers disrupts the learning process
Therefore, it is important to have substitute teachers
Besides disrupting the learning process, it seems that the economic effects of teacher absences could also be substantial
On the one hand, there are teachers that are paid but who do not perform any work; on the other hand, substitute teachers must also be paid
Finally, teacher absences may create adverse effects on the government budget because in most regions more than half of the local government budget is allocated to pay teacher salaries (Toyamah and Usman, 2004)
C Literature Review 
The question of teacher absence rates, its causes and impacts does not seem to attract much attention from education administrators
Research on this topic in a development context has rarely been implemented
The SMERU team was unable to find any existing research reports on teacher absence in Indonesia, except for several references about this topic from other countries
Because of this, the SMERU Research Institute accepted the offer from the World Bank in conjunction with the Global Development Network (GDN ) to collaborate in a study on public service delivery in education and health sectors, with a focus on the absence rates of primary school teachers and medical staff of public health centers (puskesmas) in Indonesia
The existing literature shows that teacher absence rates in developing countries tend to be high
Glewwe, Kremer, and Moulin (1999) show that in a region of Kenya, the teacher absence rate averaged at 28.4%
A report on primary education in India reveals that about one-third of school principals were not present when their schools were visited by the Public Report on Basic Education (PROBE) Team (PROBE Team, 1999)
Another study in the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Madya Pradesh show that 17% of teachers were absent, and 20% of teachers were present at their schools, but were not present in the classroom (Rao 1999; World Bank, 2001)
In the North West Frontier Province in Pakistan, with a large number of schools sampled, the average teacher absence rate was 18% (Ali and Reed, 1994; King, Orazem, and Paterno, 1999)
Another study on primary schools in Pakistan found an absent rate of about 10% (Reimers, 1993)
A World Bank study in Bangladesh in the mid 1990s showed that Schools with half of the teachers absent were frequently found and it is very normal to have a school run only by one teacher with more than 100 students in different grades (World Bank, 1995)
Research in Nicaragua shows that lack of control by the local community over schools is closely related to teacher absences (King and Ozler, 2001)
Specifically, it concludes that the Nicaraguan program to increase the independence of school managers and to increase the involvement of parents in their children's schools have helped increase teacher attendance, with the greatest impact in poor rural villages
Various studies show that teachers suffering from HIV/AIDS were frequently absent, even when their illnesses had not yet reached a critical stage (World Bank, 2002)
A study carried out by DFID on teacher development centers (Fairhurs et al., 1999) show that teacher training has become a reason for high teacher absence rates, because often substitute teachers were not available when participation in training was required
In some teacher absence cases, gender could play a role since conflicts between household affairs and duties at schools have led to higher absence rates for female teachers (El-Sanabiy, 1989)
In developed countries, teachers who are absent are usually replaced by substitute teachers, so the impact of their absence is lower compared to that in developing countries
Unfortunately, there is little literature available on this matter
A study conducted in the State of New York in the United States shows that there is a higher absence rate in schools with more flexible leave policy, while schools with more restrictive leave policies and leave that could be substituted for money, tend to have a lower absence rate (Ehrenberg, Ress, and Ehrenberg 1991)
Another study on teacher absence in a wide school district in New York City, the United States, shows that there is a consistency in absences where teachers who were frequently absent in the past are likely to continue to be absent, while those with poor performance are more likely to be absent from classrooms compared to those who have better performance histories (Pitkoff, 1993)
A survey of the literature of various studies on teacher absence concludes that there are very few clear determinants of teacher absences (Norton, 1998)
The same study also did not provide any definite conclusions on the impact of teacher absences
For instance, a study conducted by Ehrenberg et al found that there are no direct impacts between teacher absence rates and student test scores
However, it has to be noted that their research (similar to research in developed countries) only examines reported absences, meaning that if a substitute teacher is listed as working, therefore there is a full-time teacher who was absent
Norton stated that even though it is preferable to have full-time teachers rather than having substitutes, if those who were frequently absent are poorly qualified teachers, then the impact of their absences on student performance would be low
Pitkoff (1993) showed that teacher absence rates tended to be higher in schools which had lower test scores and higher failure rates
This indicates that teacher absences made students learning worse off
This seems to have bigger implications in developing countries where teacher absences are higher in rural villages
Another study from Pakistan shows that schools with high teacher absence rates tend to increase student promotion rates (from one grade to another) but reduce student advancement rate (from primary to secondary level)
The researchers believed that this is because teachers who were frequently absent could not accurately evaluate their student's progress (King, Orazem, and Paterno, 1999)
However, this study did not measure the impact of teacher absences on student grade attainment
Another study on primary schools in Pakistan that attempted to examine these aspects failed to show any correlations between teacher absence and student grade attainment (Reimer 1993)
Therefore, further detailed studies on this subject are needed
However, the basic assumptions need to be changed to teacher attendance at school is not sufficient to fully determine successful student learning in class
However, we can not deny the fact that teacher attendance is mandatory to ensure higher learning success for students
So far, literature with systematic research using national data to provide a detailed background on teacher absence is limited, 
not only in developing countries, but also in developed ones
There are insufficient findings to show that teacher attendance is a primary determinant to improve the delivery of education
However, a more comprehensive analysis on why teachers are frequently absent from their schools is needed in order to achieve better outcomes for education
D Sources and Rationales for the Study 
This paper is based on the results of a survey of primary education service delivery in Indonesia, focusing on teacher absence rates conducted by the SMERU Research Institute and the World Bank, affiliated with the Global Development Network (GDN)
Similar surveys have been conducted at the same time in seven other developing countries Bangladesh, Ecuador, India, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Uganda, and Zambia
The result of this international study is expected to document primary school teacher absence rates and their relations to individual teacher characteristics, conditions of the community and its institutions, and the education policy at various levels of authority (central/national government and local government) or at the provincial, and district/city level (for countries with a decentralized system)
Specifically, the purpose of this research is to assess the conditions of primary education service delivery in Indonesia, especially in public schools run by the government
Thus, the purposes of this study are as following
1 As input for education policymakers, both national and international; 
2 To provide information to solve various problems in education; and 
3 To build the civil society's consciousness of the condition of the delivery of primary education service and efforts to improve it
A Sample Selection 
This stage begins by collecting secondary data, especially from the Indonesian Statistics Agency (BPS) and the Ministry of Education as a basis to build a sample frame
The data gathered includes the amount of total population, list of villages, and primary school facilities in each district/city
Due to limited time and resources, this research is only focused on primary schools
Next, a sample of districts/cities and schools (consisting of primary schools and primary madrasah) were selected using the following steps
First, Indonesia was divided geographically into several regions based on the number of total population into the following Java-Bali, Sumatera, Kalimantan-Sulawesi, and Nusa Tenggara
Indonesian provinces that are still suffering from various conflicts (such as Aceh, Central Sulawesi, Maluku, North Maluku, and Papua) were removed from the sample selection process
Then, from each region, a total of five districts and cities were randomly selected, taking into account the population of each district/city (see Table 2.1)
Second, in each district/city, 12 schools were selected and with time remaining, the field researcher can visit additional schools
Specifically for the cities of Cilegon and Pasuruan, the number of additional schools sampled was determined by the number of public health centers in these two cities which were visited at the same time
In these two cities, the number of public health centers were only half of the required samples, therefore, the remaining samples were selected from schools (see Table 2.1)
Before choosing sampled schools, we randomly selected 10 villages in each district/city to be sampled, taking into account the location of these villages (in urban or rural areas)
One of the 10 villages is a backup village to anticipate the possibility of a village that is too difficult to reach
In each village sampled, researchers asked the local residents about the location of primary schools/madrasah (both public and private) in these villages
They started visiting schools, giving priority to public primary schools/madrasahs
To meet the number of samples in each district/city, additional samples were selected from private schools
Third, in each school sampled, the researcher would request a list of teachers
If a school visited is considered to be large, such as schools with more than 15 teachers, then the researcher would only interview 15 teachers chosen randomly to ensure that survey quality could be maintained despite the limited time and resources
Each school was visited twice, both on an unannounced date
From the 147 primary schools/madrasah in the sample, 1,441 teachers were selected in each visit (because this is a panel study, the teacher absence data that were used are taken only from teachers that could be interviewed or whose data were obtained from both visits)
If there are teachers whose information was only obtained from one of the visits, then their data are not included in the data set panel
In addition to the above survey, the research team also conducted a survey on student learning results through written tests on mathematics and Indonesian language to fourth-grade students in each school sampled
In each school, a maximum of 10 students were selected among all fourth-grade students that were present at the time of the survey
In 147 sampled primary schools/madrasah, 1,419 fourth-grade students took the test
B Data Collection 
Data was collected from schools during the two visits and during school sessions
The two visits were conducted on different days and times to insure there were no time variations in the collected information and to see also whether there was any variation in absentee rates during different days or times
The collection of primary data was conducted using questionnaires that were gathered on three levels
school, individual teacher/student, and national level
At the school level, 406 data variables were collected, among them concerning
Facility size, number of teachers, and teacher's names
School hours and the time when the visit was conducted
Attendance or absence of all the teachers stated in the sample list (identifying those who were present and absent)
The reasons for absences for different teachers (for those that were absent, we asked the reasons for the absence, such as, for work-related reasons, attending training sessions or meetings, assisting in census-gathering activities, or immunizations)
The activities performed by each teacher at the time of the visit
School's relative remoteness (e.g., distance from paved roads and the distance from the city center)
Distances from the nearest bank (in some countries teachers have to travel a great distance to collect their salaries from banks, therefore causing their absence from schools)
The language used by the students (to see the possibility of language differences between teachers and students, relating to teachers' absences)
Community involvement (e.g., the existence of a parents association, the number of parents attending school meetings, and the number of parents making financial contributions to the school)
Monitoring and supervision (teachers' monitoring methods and if available, the frequency of the department of education officers' visits to the school)
Discipline (the number of teachers who were given warnings or were dismissed because of their lack of discipline, and the reasons for being absent)
The procedures for replacing teachers who were absent (were there any substitute teachers, were the classes merged, or were the students sent home)
Use of school facilities (data of students who were actually present compared to the student data taken from available archives)
Schools' finances (sources of teachers' salaries, such as from the government, parents' contribution, or donations from non-profit organizations
Educational background of teachers
Characteristics (e.g., whether the surveyed school has a library, blackboards, public bathrooms, and electricity)
At the individual teacher level, 112 data variables were collected to see the variation and the causes of teacher absence from schools
A teacher was considered absent if at the time of the visit to schools, the researchers could not find the sampled teacher at the school
Beside this, to receive conformation of the attendance of each sampled teacher (those who would be interviewed) in the school, researchers conducted direct observation by meeting each sampled teachers to ascertain their whereabouts
The interview with sampled teachers was conducted until all were interviewed, before the researchers left the school
The information about the characteristics of absent teachers was obtained from the headmasters or their representatives
Later on, this information was reconfirmed with the absent teachers during the researchers' second visit (provided they were available during the second visit)
The following is collected information relating to teacher absence
Distance and transportation means to schools (the distance between teachers' residence and the school and the means of transportation used)
Linkages with surrounding communities (were the teachers born and raised near the schools where they worked and where their families lived)
Title/position of the teachers (headmasters, regular teachers, part time teachers, etc.)
Demographic characteristics of teachers (e.g., age and gender) Teachers' ethnic group and mother tongue (compared with those of the local community)
Training and education related to teachers' job (teachers' education level)
Teachers' marital status and the number of children they have (including the number of children who attended the school where the teacher works)
Teachers' extra income/earnings (from other jobs/sources)
Teachers' tenure and work experiences
Salary information (e.g., how teachers received their salaries, do the salaries always arrive on time)
Teachers' career choice motivation and their job satisfaction at the present
At the individual students' level, a test and an interview was conducted to obtain information regarding the students learning results
A total of 47 data variables were collected from each student
Two tests were provided a mathematics test and a language test
The mathematics test intended to assess the students' ability in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
The students were given 13 math questions which required completion within 20 minutes
The language test was provided to determine student literacy ability, by dictating four short sentences, which consisted of 36 words and 5 punctuation marks
The sentences were read out twice at a clear and slow pace, then the students were asked to rewrite the sentences within 2 minutes
The test results were then combined with the previous collected data relating to the background of the students and their parents, which consist of the following
Communication between the student's parents and their teachers
Parent literacy ability
Parent education level
Information on whether the students were also enrolled in private lessons or courses outside of the school
At the national level this survey was conducted to complement the data collected at the school and individual levels
For this purpose, the following questions on these topics were asked
Type of education service providers, their total number, and qualifications
Working hours and the types of excuses permitted for absences (including a question on the level of HIV/AIDS infection among teachers)
Teachers' salaries and allowances, including procedures to receive bonus salaries and promotions, also the level of non-payment salaries
Teachers' appointment, placement, and reassignment policies
Teachers' participation in school's management
Number of private schools and school conditions
Teachers' disciplinary violations and dismissal procedures
Local involvement (of parents/clients) in school decision-making process (especially regarding employees)
Conditions of political institutions and competition among political parties/factions
Number of teacher associations/unions
Through this institutional survey researchers collected various information, including official explanations on educational institutions and how these institutions were managed
Researchers conducting the national survey gathered information through both secondary sources and from interviews with officials at the Ministry of Education, related NGOs, and a sub sample of headmasters and teachers from the sampled schools selected during the field visit
C Why is a Second Field Survey Needed
The survey was conducted in 10 districts/cities through two unannounced field visits in October 2002 and March 2003
In the second survey, the research team visited 294 schools and collected abundant information on teacher attendance and absence and the impact on schools and their students
The larger the number of observed cases, the more accurate the estimation of teacher absences would be
Through the two visits to each school, we could easily find out whether the absence rate was concentrated amongst a certain group of teachers or if there were more variations among them
This information could have different policy implications
For instance, a 20% absence rate could be obtained either because the number of absent teachers were actually 20% of all teachers or because 15% of these absent teachers were those who actually never work as teachers but were listed and paid as teachers, while the other 5% were those who were rarely absent
In this case, the policy implications of these disguised teachers' would not have any impact on the other teachers who were seldom absent
On the other hand, if this 20% were spread among some or all teachers, there would be different policy implications involved
Thus, the second field visit could help us to determine which one of the above problems exists in schools and thus, proper policy implications could be determined
Because most information about the teachers was gathered during the first visit, researchers did not have to obtain a great deal of additional information during the second visit
Nevertheless, the second visit not only increased the accuracy of the estimated absence rate, but was also important for gathering specific individual data of the teachers who were called on during the first visit
By doing this, researchers could obtain a better picture of who the absent teachers were and why they were absent
The accuracy of information would diminish if researchers only surveyed teachers who were never absent
By combining the information from both the individual and school level, and by comparing it with information obtained from national institutions, researchers could get a clearer institutional policy that have substantial implications on the absence rate
Based on the above descriptions, we can see that the amount of information collected through a study of the delivery of primary education services is both numerous and of various types that can hopefully be used for other working papers
This paper only incorporates some of the survey results closely related to the problem of absenteeism among primary school teachers
A General Primary Education Policy 
According to Law No 20/2003 on the National Educational System, primary education is divided into two parts
1) primary education, divided further into primary schools (sekolah dasar (SD)) or primary madrasahs (madrasah ibtidaiyah (MI)) that is conducted for six years, and 2) lower secondary education, divided further into lower secondary schools (sekolah menengah pertama (SMP)) and lower secondary madrasahs (madrasah tsanawiyah (MTs)), which is conducted for three years
These schools can be operated by both the government and the private sector
For primary education, the government operates 93% of 148,964 primary schools (Depdiknas, 2001) and 7% of 22,799 primary madrasahs (Depag, 2002)
The focus of this paper is primary education at the primary schools/madrasahs level, especially public primary schools (both public primary schools and Inpres primary schools)
Until now, new operational regulations on primary education is based on Law No 2, 1989 (see Figure 3.1)
The learning process in primary schools is carried out using the general curriculum that contains general studies subjects which are regulated by the Ministry of Education
The curriculum of a primary school must at least contain the following subjects
1) Pancasila (national ideology) education; 2) Religious education; 3)Citizenship education; 4) Indonesian language; 5) Reading and writing; 6) Mathematics, including counting; 7) Introduction to Natural Science and Technology; 8) Geography; 9) Indonesian and General History; 10) Handcraft and Arts; 11) Sports and Health Education; and 12) Drawing
Primary madrasahs use a mixed curriculum, which besides comprising of general studies subjects taught in regular primary schools, also offers Islamic studies subject, which are regulated by the Ministry of Religious Affairs
Islamic studies for primary madrasah students are divided into five sub-fields
1) Koran-Hadits; 2) aqidah-akhlak; 3) fiqih; 4) Islamic cultural history; dan 5) Arabic language
The existence of these two forms of education create two different primary education standards
Among them is the tendency for Madrasah students to show low quality and low learning results in general studies subjects
This results from the MI requirement to teach two different curriculums, resulting in a higher study load for madrasah students 
as they are required to learn all general education subjects required by the Ministry of Education and also all Islamic studies subjects required by the Ministry of Religious Affairs
Differences between primary schools and madrasahs could also be seen from the differences in the quality of administration and management of these schools (SMERU, 2003)
Ironically, most of the government's financial support for schools were directed to primary schools, even though many madrasahs still have poor administration management and most of their students are from low- income families which should be more eligible to receive higher levels of assistance
There are two important facts about education and poverty in Indonesia
First, 87% of the poor have obtained only some forms of primary or lower education
Second, 62% of poor citizens are under 30 years of age (ILO, 2004)
This strong correlation between education and poverty demands assurances that there should be maximum opportunities and access for the poor to pursue quality education and training that are relevant to their needs
In 1984, the government started a six-year compulsory primary education program for all Indonesians
This program was combined with major a program for the construction of primary school buildings throughout Indonesia and was considered to be very successful
This was reflected by the fact that by 1988 about 96% of all children aged between 7 to 12 years were enrolled in primary schools/madrasahs (GOI, 1997/98)
In 1994, the compulsory education program was expanded to nine years
The goal of this program was that by 1998 all children aged between 7 to 15 years would be enrolled in primary and lower secondary schools/madrasahs
However, due to the 1997 economic crisis, this target was postponed until 2008
B High Quality and Relevant Primary Education 
Based on the 2000/2001 National Education Statistics (Balitbang, Depdiknas, 2003) there are 1,128,475 primary school teachers in Indonesia, which is about 25% of the total number of civil servants (PNS)
Primary school teaching staff consist of the headmaster, grade teachers, and subject teachers
In general, most primary schools used grade teachers, except in the subjects of religious education and sports and health teachers
If the number of available teachers were compared with the total number of classrooms available, it is estimated that there is still a shortage of 236,500 grade teachers
The shortages of headmasters, religious teachers, and sports and health teachers are estimated at 2,900; 3,900; and 75,800 teachers respectively
In addition, based on the minimum education background (teachers with at least a Diploma-2), about 54% of all teachers (about 607,900 teachers) were formally unqualified to teach (see Table 3.1)
In 2003, teacher shortage has expanded to about 427,903, while the Ministry of Education could only appoint 190,714 assistant/part-time teachers on a contract basis
Even if the physical support facilities for education (e.g., textbooks or school buildings) are sufficient, these are meaningless if they are not supported by an adequate number of qualified teachers who are fully dedicated to their profession
Related to the above problems, the Indonesian education system is in need of a major overhaul
Recently, President Megawati Soekarnoputri stated that The community needs to change its paradigm for the future of its children
It is not necessary for all Indonesian children to become university graduates (Media Indonesia, 23 December 2003)
In fact, such a paradigm change should not be based on community needs, instead it should come from government policy, especially from government officials responsible for education policies
The current education system is biased towards those who intend to continue their education to higher or tertiary education levels
Since primary education, students are given theoretical subjects that would become the basis of university-level study
School curriculums do not place adequate emphasis on practical/technical skills such as literacy and counting (reading, writing, and arithmetic) as a basis for expanding individual talents in the real world
If there are any primary school graduates successful in expanding their technical skills and then able to use these skills to support their livelihood, many would assume that this was achieved through their natural talents in these skills, not through schooling
In practice, most Indonesian students, especially those from low income backgrounds, are more likely to discontinue their education after completing primary school
Very few Indonesian students are fortunate enough to obtain higher education or university degrees
Therefore, it can be predicted that most students able to graduate from universities were able to do so because they have sufficient funding to do so, not because of the talents they have
This means that many students that have the potential to become university graduates were not able to accomplish this because they do not have adequate funding to continue their education, and some of them have to leave school before they are able to finish their primary education
What is the message behind the above facts
Considering that up to now the highest level of education obtainable by most Indonesian students is only primary level, meaning that our education paradigm must be changed
Primary education curriculum must put more emphasis on technical/practical knowledge as the basis of skills that are needed by the community
Thus, the majority of primary education graduates would be expected to acquire practical skills and the capacity to expand their talents
Another important change needed in the education paradigm is an overhaul in teacher management, including provision of an incentive system as the primary instrument to motivate teachers so that their functions and roles remain constructive to the learning process at schools
This system should cover teacher rights and responsibilities
C Excused Absences for Teachers
Regular Leave and Sick Leave 
In general, the leave regulations for civil servants also apply to most teachers,
except the annual leave that is equal to 12 working days
Civil servants in schools that have regular breaks are not eligible for regular leave
To receive permission of leave or sick leave, a teacher must submit written permission to an assigned government official
After receiving this permission, the teacher can then receive official leave with regular pay 
Sabbatical leave
Civil servants (teachers) who have been working in the civil service continuously for six years are entitled to a three month sabbatical leave
This leave can be postponed by a superior official for up to two years in the case of urgent official business or duties
Sick leave
Teachers who have been sick for more than 1 to 2 days must inform their supervisors
If the teacher is sick for between 2 to 14 days, they have to inform their supervisors in writing with a reference letter from a doctor attached
If the sickness is expected to last for more than 14 days, they have to provide a written leave request with a reference letter from a doctor that has been sanctioned by the Ministry of Health
If granted, this leave is valid for up to one year, with the possibility of a six month extension
After recovery, they must pass a teaching skills and abilities test, and if they were not able to pass this test, or are still ill after one and a half years of sick leave, then they receive an honorable discharge from their position
Miscarriage leave
Teachers suffering from miscarriages are entitled to leave of up to 1.5 months
Maternity leave
Teachers who are giving birth are entitled to three-months leave from one month before and two months after they give birth (for their first three children)
For the birth of the fourth (or subsequent) child, the teacher will only receive unpaid leave
Family emergency leave
Teachers are entitled to family emergency leave for up to two months
Family emergencies are defined by the regulation that includes major illnesses or the death of parents (father or mother), spouse (husband or wife), children, siblings, or in-laws
Family emergency also includes a teacher's first marriage
Unpaid leave (without government pay)
Even though this is not a right, teachers have the opportunity to request unpaid leaves
This leave can be granted for up to three years and is renewable for another year
This leave is given to civil servants that have worked in the civil service for five consecutive years
Civil servants receiving unpaid leave are not entitled to receive their salaries, effective from the first month they begin their leave, and all the facilities they receive from the government must be returned to their supervisors
Unpaid leave can only be approved by a decree from a superior official, after receiving permission from the Director of the National Civil Service Agency
D Teacher Income 
Teachers, including headmasters who are civil servants, receive the following income (in cash)
1) basic salary; 2) spouse allowance; 3) child allowance; 4) special allowances for high- ranking government positions; 5) educational position allowance; and 6) pension
The amount of these incomes are as follows
1) basic salary is in accordance with civil service grade and year of service; 2) spouse allowance is 10% of the basic salary; 3) child allowance is 2% of basic salary per child (up to the third child), and 4) special allowances are set up according to the prevailing regulations
Beside this, teachers also receive non-cash benefits in the form of health care benefit and a defined benefit pension
Teachers who are entitled to a pension are those with civil servant status
The pension is received every month after the teacher has entered retirement
To be eligible for full pension according to pension regulations, the teacher must be at least 50 years of age and have a minimum of 20 years working in the civil service
They can submit an application for early retirement
The mandatory retirement age for teachers is 60 years of age
The maximum amount of pension received by beneficiaries is 75% of their final basic salary
For instance, a teacher with the highest civil service grade (IV/e grade) with 30 years in the civil service would earn a basic salary of Rp1.760.400 per month, and are entitled to a pension of Rp1.320.300 per month or about US$155 per month (Government Regulation No 11/2003)
E Financial Incentives for Teachers 
To encourage an increase in teacher attendance, a cash incentive program for teachers is available
The program consist of two parts, which are overtime teaching pay and substitute teaching pay
Overtime teaching is determined by subtracting actual teaching time from required teaching time
Teachers must teach for 24 hours each week
For example, if a teacher taught for 42 hours in a week, then he/she has 18 hours of overtime teaching
The teacher is entitled to overtime pay of 18 hours x Rp 2,000 x 4 weeks = Rp 120,000 per month
The overtime incentive is positive motivation to increase teacher attendance at school, because it is given based on the teachers' daily duties at school
Thus, its administration must be clear, strict, transparent, and accountable with an adequate incentive amount to meet teacher's daily needs
Overtime teaching pay of Rp 2,000 per hours seems to be insufficient and inadequate to encourage high attendance rates among teachers
According to Ki Supriyoko (2004), an education expert, nowadays many teachers served their students for only a few hours in the classrooms
Outside the classrooms, they seem to have no obligation to teach their students
Beside overtime teaching pay there is also a substitute teaching pay set by the headmaster
Assigning substitute teachers is usually conducted in rotation among the teachers who have the duty and responsibility to insure a smooth learning process
These duties include preventing disturbances from outside the school
There is also a non-cash incentive program to encourage higher teacher attendance
However, attendance rates are merely one eligibility factor for teacher to receive such incentives
Examples of non-cash incentives include medals/awards and the chance to participate in educational studies in other Indonesian regions or overseas
Teacher participation in educational studies are regulated by the Directorate General of Primary and Lower Secondary Education of the Ministry of National Education
Teachers with outstanding achievements are recommended by their headmasters to the local Department of Education
Then, the local Department of Education submits this recommendation to the Ministry of National Education, which makes their selection based on this recommendation
F Disciplinary Sanctions and Dismissal of Teachers 
The disciplinary sanctions afforded to teachers include formal warning, suspension of salary, permanent demotion of grade and salary, transfer to another school, and temporary dismissal/non-active status
The ranking of sanctions are as follows
a) light disciplinary sanctions (e.g., verbal warning, formal written warning, and written statement of unsatisfactory performance); 
b) moderate disciplinary sanctions (e.g., postponement of regular salary increased for a maximum of one year, postponement of promotion for a maximum of one year, and; 
c) heavy disciplinary sanctions (e.g., demotion to a lower rank for a maximum of one year, dismissal from position, honorable dismissal not by own request as a civil servant, dishonorable dismissal from the civil service)
Dismissal of civil servants may be initiated by the following
1) individual's own request; 2) reached the retirement age; 3) restructuring of the given public agency; 4) found guilty of a violation/criminal activity/misconduct; 5) found to be physically and mentally incompetent; 6) left duties without prior permission; 7) declared dead or missing, and 8) other causes, for instance, failure to return to duty after completing unpaid leave
The procedures to be followed to dismiss a teacher who is frequently absent is as follows
1) give verbal warnings; 2) give written warnings if the teacher is absent for more than one month without any good reason; 3) suspension; and 4) if the teacher still violates absentee regulations, be dismissed
Previously, the authority to dismiss a teacher was in the hands of the Ministry of National Education
However, since the implementation of national decentralization policy in January 1, 2001, this authority rests in the hands of the Regent's Head/Major
Through two field visits, SMERU has conducted 2,854 observations on teacher attendance
More than 1,400 primary school/madrasah teachers (both public and private) were interviewed twice
The result was that approximately 27% of respondents were considered absent, meaning they could not be found and interviewed when the researchers visited their schools
However, not all of these absent teachers could be recorded in the absence list, because among these teachers were a number who could not be categorized as teachers as defined by this study
The following is the method by which we adjust the number of these teachers
First, teachers who were reported by their headmasters (or their representatives) as having retired, moved, or working in a different work shift, were excluded from our analysis
While the researchers have selected their sample based on the teachers who were declared to be present at the school during their visits, there is no way to verify these lists independently
By removing teachers under the above category from our analysis, the number of absent teachers are lowered
This method is used both for the first and second visits
By excluding these teachers, about one-third of the teachers who were declared absent were removed from our analysis
However, teachers who were not assigned to a school during the first visit, but were assigned to the school during the second visit (i.e., new teachers) are still included in our analysis
Second, we only included full-time teachers in our analysis
This step is important because previously, all teachers who were reported to work in a different shift (i.e., part-time teachers) have been removed from our analysis
Through these steps, the number of observations in our analysis was reduced to 2,390 observations
Third, since this study is related to an international survey that focused on public/government-managed schools, our analysis was limited mostly to public school teachers
A Absence Rates and Their Rationales 
Before excluding private primary school teachers (including private madrasahs) from our analysis, it might be worthwhile to compare the absence rates of public and private primary school teachers
The analysis shows that the difference between the two groups is very minimal – 19% for public primary school teachers and 18% for private primary school teachers – and that they were not statistically significant
This small difference might be surprising to some, because many have assumed that due to higher financial and managerial governance and accountability of private schools, along with the higher quality of education services delivered by them, private school teachers' attendance would be much higher than that of public school teachers
This assumption was not proven valid in this study
We found that teacher absence rates for primary public school teachers in Indonesia is about 19%, 
18% (168 people) during the first visit and 20% (179 people) during the second visit
All of the teachers who were absent during the first visit were present during the second visit
This means that the teachers who were absent during the first visit and the second visit were coming from different groups of teachers
However, a 19% absence rate is considered to be higher compared to other developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America
Table 4.1 showed the absence rates from each of the eight countries where similar studies were conducted during the same time period, using the same methodology
We found that Indonesia ranked third out of eight countries, after Uganda and India
What are the rationales for teacher absences
Table 4.2 shows the rationales for absences given by headmasters (or their representatives) for the teachers working in their school facilities
About 37% of the absent teachers were reported as sick or as absent with leave, 19% were reported as performing official duties outside of school, 
about 26% were reported as arriving late, leaving early, absent without leave/permission, etc
Finally, about 18% of the absent teachers had unknown/unclear excuses
Usually, they were reported as present by the headmasters (or their representatives), but researchers were not able to locate them at their school
Two reasons considered acceptable for absence and could not be determined by the headmasters themselves include illness or excused/official leave
These types of absences are considered teachers' rights as civil servants
Thus, headmasters could not refuse absence requests due to teachers' illnesses or leave requests, although they could ask teachers to postpone their leave in the case of urgent official duties that require them present at their school
From this survey, we found from 127 out of 1,837 observations (about one-third of all absence reasons) were caused by these two rationales
Thus, if we relate these numbers to the prevailing official leave rules and regulations (see the previous section) then we might underestimate the number of teachers who were absent due to these two rationales
This is because often, headmasters easily grant leave requests from teachers for attending other activities not stated in the official leave regulations (e.g., to attend wedding ceremonies, selamatan, and funerals of friends/neighbors, including to accompany friends/neighbors who are taking religious pilgrimages to Mecca
Compared with these two rationales, teacher absences due to other rationales/excuses listed in Table 4.2 (rationales no 3 to no 10), can cause problems that disrupt the learning process in schools
For instance, 12,7% of all absences could not be explained satisfactorily by headmasters or their representatives
They could be broken down into arrived at the school late or left the school early
These absences do not necessarily create negative impacts on the learning process, as long as the teachers do not become absent for the entire day
This occurred to some of the teachers encountered by the research team, even though they were declared to be absent or had left the school after being interviewed by the researchers
About 18,7% of the absent teachers were absent because they performed official school duties outside of the school (see Table 4.2)
Possible negative impacts of these absences could be minimized because generally their absences would have to be known in advance by school officials
Thus, headmasters could arrange or assign other teachers to substitute them
One could argue that in some cases, teachers should be given more chances to perform official duties outside of schools, such as participating in training or educational activities regarding school management/teaching
By participating in these activities, it is hoped that teachers would develop better thinking, vision, subject knowledge, new teaching and problem-solving skills 
that would improve the quality of their schools
However, these activities should be accomplished under a clear human resource development strategy
Without such a strategy, the results could erode the mission of education to promote better behavior, values, and intellectuality, among students
For instance, Ki Supriyoko (2004) has stated that many teacher training institutions only offer second-class training for teachers who wished to obtain university degrees
Often, these institutions granted degrees to teachers while only requiring them to attend a small amount of in-class instructions
In some cases, there are teachers who could pass their final exam even though they only attended their class twice in a semester
In fact, there are teachers that passed their final exams even though they never attend classes at all
Also, some teachers earned their degrees through distance learning and were never present in any real classrooms
As a result, there are many teachers who obtained university degrees, but in practice, they do not increase their knowledge and vision at all
B The Accuracy of Official Teacher Attendance Lists 
We have discussed the teachers who were declared present in their schools by headmasters (or their representatives), but were not witnessed or interviewed by researchers
Table 4.3 shows a comparison between teacher attendance according to their headmasters (or their representatives), based on the school's attendance list, with researchers own observations at the schools visited
Headmasters or their representatives were very accurate in reporting teacher absences
From the 1,522 teachers who were reported present, only 63 teachers (4%) could not be located by researchers on school grounds
However, this number could lower teacher absence rates compared with the rate found by researchers in their observation at schools' visited
If we use the absence rate from the accounts of headmasters (or their representatives), the absent rate would go down to about 16,9% of all teachers in the sample, while the absent rate calculated from researchers' observation is about 19% of all teachers in the sample
On the other hand, if we rely solely on the attendance list to determine teacher absence, then the absence rate would increase significantly, since only about 59% of all sampled teachers who were declared to be present by headmasters (or their representatives) signed the attendance list
Completion of attendance lists in many schools were not strictly observed
Many of the teachers who were reported to be present by headmasters (or their representatives) are more likely to sign the attendance list before they left the school on that day
The researchers even found some schools where the teachers signed the attendance list once per week 
and schools that could not show an attendance list, 
even though the government has provided all schools in Indonesia with teacher attendance lists
In addition, most of the unexplained absences found at schools would be listed as due to illness or official leave in the attendance list, 
which in turn would be reported by the schools to the office or officials that supervise their operations
Thus, we could not rely on the attendance list as accurate evidence of teacher attendance
C Absence Rates by Districts/Cities 
Even though the national absence rate is 19% of all teachers sampled, there is a big discrepancy found in the absence rate of teachers from each district/city surveyed
Table 4.4 shows that the lowest district-level absence rate (7,4%) is found in the District of Magelang (Central Java), while the highest district-level absence rate (33,5%) – about 4,5 times higher than the lowest district-level absence rate is found in the City of Pekanbaru (Riau Province, Sumatera)
There are two interesting facts that could be observed from Table 4.4
First, there is no evidence that larger district/city budget allocation to the education sector would result in higher attendance rates
In 2001, the City of Pekanbaru allocated Rp5,342 billion to the education sector - almost 2,5 times that of the District of Magelang - which allocates Rp 2,112 billion for the education sector
Second, there is no clear relationship between the development level of a region and teacher absences in these regions
Many have thought that since Java is the most advanced island in Indonesia, it would have a lower absence rate
In practice, this was not the case
Even though Java has the two lowest absence rates in the sample, it also has the second and third-highest absence rates in the sample (see Table 4.4 for details)
This indicates that the absence rate is more clearly associated with the education policy implemented in each province and district/city, which were decentralized since 2001
However, the impact of decentralization policy on education service delivery still requires further analysis, since according to SMERU's analyses (2000, 2002a, 2002b), implementation of decentralization policy in Indonesia has not created any measurable impacts in schools
In other words, after three years under decentralization, the quality of education service delivery at schools remains unchanged (has not improved, but also has not become worse)
Decentralization also has not changed the physical conditions of school buildings
D Correlation of Absence Rates with Individual Teacher Characteristics 
Table 4.5 describes more detailed individual backgrounds related to teacher absences, such as the following
Female teachers significantly tend to have a lower absence rate compared with male teachers
While some have predicted that conflicts between female teachers' households and school duties would lead them to have a higher absence rate, as have been found in the Middle East and North America (El-Sanabiy, 1989)
However, this study does not show that this trend is found in Indonesia
This is somewhat surprising because originally it was expected that since Indonesia shares the same characteristics as the countries surveyed by El-Sanabiy (specifically, they all have the same social values about the role of women as prescribed by the same religion (Islam)), then Indonesia would have the similar trends as these other countries
Teachers with low formal education levels tend to have lower absence rates
On the other hand, those with higher formal education levels tend to have higher absence rates
This might be caused by the possible higher opportunities for teachers with high formal education levels to obtain extra jobs outside of teaching, especially when they live in cities
Teachers' civil servants status strongly correlates with teachers' absence rate
Originally, it was predicted that part-time/contract teachers with no civil servant status would have lower absence rates, so that they would have better evaluation results that would enable them to be promoted as full-time civil servants
However, on the contrary we found that part-time/contract teachers have higher absence rates compared with teachers with full- time civil servant status
The following are the possible causes for this trend
First, part- time/contract teachers have lower salaries compared with full-time teachers, so it is more likely that they would have to work in other places in order to earn sufficient income for their livelihoods
Part-time/contract teachers' salaries ranged from Rp50,000 – Rp450,000/month, while full-time civil servants teachers were paid Rp782,000 to Rp955,000/month
Second, even though work experience as part-time/contract teachers is a plus, they will have to follow the regular civil servants' recruitment and examination procedures like other applicants (with no teaching experiences) when there are openings for full-time civil servant positions
Teachers at schools that were located near the local Department of Education's office tended to have a lower absence rate compared to those from areas further away from the local Department of Education's office
These schools tended to be located in poor or even remote areas, and in general were located in rural villages
The primary reasons for absences in these areas were due to difficult transportation conditions and lack of supervision from the local Department of Education's office
There are many teachers in the villages who live further away from the schools where they work
At the same time, public transportation is almost nonexistent and road conditions are often very poor, even when accessed by motorbikes (especially during the rainy season) (see graph 4.1)
These conditions were made worse by lack of supervision from the local Department of Education's office, which encourages teachers in villages to become more lax in attending their duties
In addition, they do not receive special benefits/treatments for serving in the villages and receive the same salaries/benefits as teachers serving in the cities
The government does not provide special incentive schemes to encourage teachers to become more willing to serve in remote rural villages
Table 4.5 also provides an overview of several schools' characteristics related to teacher absences, for instances
In schools where headmasters were absent more frequently, the teachers were also more likely to be absent, compared with schools where headmasters were present regularly
Teacher absence rates in schools that do not have public bathroom facilities were significantly higher compared with schools that had such facilities
Public bathrooms are considered a basic public good (since people could not perform hygiene activities in public places)
Thus, in schools with no public bathroom facilities, teachers have to travel some distance if there is a need for them to use such facilities, thus disrupting the learning process
Teacher absences from schools that do not have adequate number of classrooms for all of their grades (thus, have to merge some grades into a single classroom) are higher compared to schools that can place each grade in their own classroom
This indicates that teacher absences tend to be higher in schools with poorer physical support facilities
Teachers in schools that were recently inspected by their local Department of Education officials have similar absence rates than those that have not been inspected by such officials
Thus, inspection activities do not have any significant effects in influencing teacher attendance one way or the other
This may be related to many anecdotal stories that inspection activities are carried out to find faults at schools, not to guide them
In such cases, bribes are often used to stop inspectors from finding such faults
These stories have been heard frequently in most Indonesian regions for years so that many schools simply bribe inspectors whenever they visit them
The question is, are these only anecdotal stories or could they be proven quantitatively
There is a shortage of teachers in Indonesia
Moreover, teacher distribution is also unequal, especially between schools in urban and rural areas
This disparity does not only relate to the number of teachers available, but also the quality of the teachers
In rural schools, especially those in remote places, there are more young inexperienced teachers 
or teachers who are transferred to rural areas as a form of punishment
Moreover, a number of local departments of education use this form of punishment to refrain teachers from being absent, 
although teaching quality depends heavily on the teachers' knowledge and motivation (Surakhmad, 2004)
Thus, the policy of assigning young teachers to remote areas and using recruitment to remote areas as a form of punishment means the teaching process in schools in remote areas remains inadequate
Coupled with the fact that most poor people live in these areas, this policy provides another obstacle for the poor to escape poverty
This means that school development in poor and remote areas needs special policy 
in order to ensure that subsequent generations living in those areas can escape poverty
Since teacher distribution usually favors urban schools, 
teacher absence is more problematic in rural areas
There are enough, or even surplus, teachers in urban schools, so an absent teachers can easily be replaced
Such is not the case in rural areas An absent teacher can force a class to continue without acceptable supervision or even discontinue a class
During the survey, SMERU researchers came across classes that were taught by senior students (Figure 5.1) 
In this survey, the researchers administered mathematics and language tests to fourth grade students
The math test was administered to evaluate students' ability in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, while the language test was given to examine students' writing ability
In general the scores were quite good, since the majority of students achieved a score of above 50 (in a 0-100 range), for both tests (Table 5.1)
However, when observed in greater detail, there was a disparity between urban and rural schools
Students in rural schools performed significantly worse than students in urban schools
The percentage of students in rural areas who received a math score of less than or equal to 50 was almost twice the number of students in urban areas
For language tests, the percentage was even three times higher (Table 5.1)
Figure 5.2 shows four samples of the language test results among students in rural schools
Since writing subjects are provided since first grade, 
fourth grade students should have adequate experience
However, the survey showed that several students could not even write a single word
The language test consisted of dictating four sentences twice and then letting the students write the sentences down
The sentences were (in Bahasa Indonesia)
Mengapa tanaman menjadi kering tanpa air
Manusia membutuhkan makanan dan air supaya menjadi kuat dan sehat, begitu juga tanaman
Tanaman hijau menggunakan air untuk membuat makanannya
Tanaman yang tidak mendapat air akan layu dan menjadi kering
Students' success does not only depend on adequate number and quality of teachers
However, students at schools where teachers are lacking both in number and quality are hard pressed to achieve their full potential
Table 5.2 shows the relationship between students' test scores and teacher absence
In general there is a tendency that schools whose teacher absence rate is high have low performing students
Further calculation shows that teacher absence has a negative and significant relationship with mathematics scores and a negative but insignificant relationship with language scores
The calculation suggests that in contrast to learning mathematics, learning language skills do not need special guidance from teachers
Students can learn writing by imitation, and most parents can teach their children reading and writing
On the other hand, students require specific teacher guidance in acquiring mathematics skills, especially understanding the logical process
In this regard, many parents in Indonesia do not have the ability to teach such knowledge
Although Table 5.2 proves that teachers are an important factor, it also shows that teachers alone are not enough to guarantee a student's success
Table 5.3 shows that there are teacher factors which are very important in ensuring success
Tenure has a positive and significant correlation with students' math performance but insignificant to language performance
It means the longer the average tenure or the more experienced the teachers, mathematics performance will be higher
Similarly, the table also shows that the higher the student per teacher ratio in a school the better mathematics performance
However, this increase in performance stops at a ratio of 25:1
At ratios higher than 25, mathematics performance starts to decline
This shows that the current policy of a student teacher ratio of 25:1 is correct
Unfortunately, there are still many schools where the ratio is still too low or too high
The proportion of teachers with additional jobs is another variable that has a negative and significant correlation with mathematics performance (Table 5.3)
It means that as more teachers engage in other work, the worse the mathematics performance of students in that school
In Indonesia, the other work is usually teaching at another school
Although teaching at other schools may seem helpful in tackling the problem of teacher shortage, in practice this has not been the case as teachers only agree to teach at other schools in order to increase their income without regards to other aspects of teaching
This causes teacher fatigue, which leads to frequent absence, which eventually destroys the quality of education in many schools
This information leads one to think that teachers should not be allowed to engage in multiple jobs, namely teaching in multiple schools, provided that income from teaching at one school is adequate
Teachers assigned to a school must work full time in that school and nowhere else
Schools that had conducted teacher meetings in the last six months have students that perform significantly better, both on math or language tests, while the proportion of female teachers has a negative and significant relationship to math scores
However, Table 5.4 shows markedly different information regarding females, in that they perform significantly better in both tests
This result mirrors results from other countries, where it has been documented that boys are lagging behind girls (Buckingham, 2003)
This trend should be regarded more as a problem than as an indicator of the success in putting girls through school
It is possible that efforts to increase the participation of girls in schools have shifted the focus of education to girls and away from boys, instead of focusing on both
Table 5.4 shows that students whose mothers had at least a high school education performed significantly better than students whose mother has less than high school education
In contrast, the father's level of education was not a significant factor in student performance
This makes sense since in Indonesia mothers play a more significant role in raising children
Another variable that impacts negatively on language test results is mother tongue and language of instruction at school
Table 5.4 shows that students in schools in communities whose mother tongue is not Bahasa Indonesia perform worse in language test
This illustrates the importance of the teachers' ability in speaking local languages
The last variable that has a negative and significant influence on both math and language tests is the availability of a playground
This result needs further investigation because studies have shown the positive effects of physical activity on children
However, play should be limited too reduce tiredness and fatigue which can affect concentration levels
This paper reports the results of a teacher absenteeism survey and its impact on student performance in public primary schools
This kind of survey is still rare in Indonesia, 
This survey was conducted on two unannounced visits in October 2002 and March 2003
This report is written with a consideration that teachers hold a position as spearheads in learning activities, especially at the primary level
If a teacher is absent and there is no replacement, then learning will be disrupted
Besides this, economically, teacher absence wastes the educational budget because teacher salaries in many regions constitute a large part of the civil budget
Thus, it is important to gain an understanding of teacher absence and its causes so steps can be taken to reduce teacher absence
Among the eight developing countries that participated in similar surveys, Indonesia is ranked third at 19%, after Uganda and India with 39% and 25% respectively
Peru has the lowest absence rate with 11%
Teacher absence in Indonesia has achieved a worrying level not because of its relatively high rate, but because 45% of absences were for unacceptable reasons
Moreover, 36% of the absentees were those who were sick or on official leave, and the rest were due to official duties
Absence rates in each district are markedly different from other districts
The lowest rate is in Magelang with 7.4% and the highest in 33.5% in Pekanbaru
There are two interesting things to note here
First, the educational budget is not an important factor in increasing teacher attendance
Pekanbaru is a relatively wealthy capital of the Province of Riau, and it has the highest absence rate, while Magelang is one of the poorer districts in Central Java and it has the lowest absence rate
Second, the level of development of an area also has no relationship with teacher absence
Java, as the most developed island in Indonesia, should have a relatively low absence rate, but the facts beg to differ
Although the districts with the lowest and second lowest absence rates are in Java, the districts with the second and third highest absence rates are also in Java
Analysis of different individual teacher and school characteristics show that they have a correlation with teacher absence
Some of these include
The increasing proportion of female teachers in general may reduce absence rates because female teachers have a lower absence rate
However, their ability should be improved since the survey also showed that there is a negative and significant correlation between female teachers and student mathematics performance
The policy of hiring contract teachers should be evaluated because contract teachers have a much higher absence rate than permanent teachers
Contract teachers' absence could be due to the fact that they are paid very low salaries
If the local government can increase their salary to the level closer to permanent teachers, they should appoint the teachers as permanent teachers
Although teachers with lower levels of formal education have a significantly lower absence rate, reverting the hiring policy to teachers with low levels of education should be avoided because it will impact on learning activities
In addition, teachers with low levels of education should be given further training
There is an indication that school facilities have an impact on teacher performance
This report shows that schools with toilets have lower teacher absence rates
A similar phenomenon occurs in schools where each class is located in a different room
This shows that development and maintenance of school facilities is important
Inspections should be managed as a means for training, not a method to assess violations
Although this survey did not show the relationship between inspections and absence rates, schools whose principals were absent have higher absence rates
This also indicates it may be necessary to install supervisors at schools
Teacher attendance by itself is not enough to ensure success for students, but teacher absence has a negative impact on students
Simple calculations show that there is a negative correlation between teacher absence rates and math and language test results on fourth grade students, which means schools with high teacher absence rates have students with lower scores
Although the correlation is only significant on math tests, this fact serves as an early sign of the importance of reducing teacher absence to increase student performance
On a broad level, educational policies that pertain to teachers have caused a discrepancy of teachers between urban and rural areas, both in number and in quality
The impact of this policy is illustrated by the fact that student performance in rural schools is significantly worse than student performance in urban schools
This should serve as a warning about the importance of assigning teachers proportionally between rural and urban areas
In addition, rural schools should receive extra benefits because schools in these areas are especially important as means for children to escape poverty
This is the reason why the government should provide special incentive schemes for teachers who are willing to teach in rural areas
Calculations on several teacher and school variables show the relationship between these variables and math and language tests scores
Several conclusions can be gathered, including
Knowledge of mathematics requires more intensive guidance than language knowledge
Analysis shows that absence rates and experience of teachers have significant impacts (negative for absence and positive for experience) on math scores but not on writing scores
Student per teacher ratio of 25:1 is ideal in a classroom, at least for mathematics courses
An increases in the ratio up to 25:1 is positive for students, but a ratio any higher than 25:1 is detrimental
Teachers with additional employment, including teaching at multiple schools, tend to be detrimental to student performance
This survey shows a negative relationship between the proportions of teachers with additional employment to math performance
Basically, teachers engage in additional employment because of the lack of income
This study highlights the need of a policy that integrates two things increasing teacher welfare, and increasing the number and distribution of teachers
When the policy is implemented properly, the next step is to prohibit teachers from engaging additional employment, including teaching in multiple schools
Although the superiority of girls can be seen as a success, it can also be taken as a problem
The intensity of the movement to increase female participation in schools may have put boys in a disadvantaged position
Another problem that needs to be taken into account is the relatively minor role of fathers in the early education of children
This has resulted in the insignificance of father education to determine student performance, while mothers' education is a significant variable
In closing, this report only describes a small portion of educational problems in Indonesia, and the results from this report still need to be researched further
There are still many problems that are not yet sufficiently understood, thus further investigations should be conducted

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
1 This study entitled An Impact Evaluation of Systematic Land Titling (IE-SLT) was undertaken at the request of the World Bank, and conducted between January and May 2002
The general objectives of the study are to assess
(i) the economic and social impacts of systematic land certification/titling under the LAP; (ii) the ways in which the process of implementation of certification has affected outcomes; and (iii) policy conclusions and implications for further policy development
2 A quantitative survey that involved questionnaires and was supplemented by in-depth interviews with key informants was used in data collection
Fourteen districts and cities in which the LAP had been conducted were selected purposively for data collection
Within these areas, sub-districts (kecamatan) were chosen purposively based on the extent of urbanization (urban, rural and semi-urban characteristics), as were the specific kelurahan and desa selected as research sites
In all, 1,596 respondent households were selected randomly from within the villages
These consisted of 1,004 households that received a land certificate under the LAP, 84 households that lived in the same area and who were eligible but did not participate in the LAP, and 508 households that could not obtain a certificate because the LAP was not carried out in their area
The third group was intended to be a control group
3 Some 15% of the 84 non-participant respondents said that they did not have the opportunity to participate in the LAP because they could not submit adequate proof of their ownership claims
However, the most common reason given was they lacked money at the time
Other reasons for non-participation were conflicts over land boundaries, non-subdivision among heirs of inherited land, insufficient information, no advantages in having a certificate, absence from home at the time of adjudication and lateness in making an application
4 The official charge per land parcel for LAP certification was Rp11,500 in urban and semi-urban areas and Rp2,500 in rural areas
Information from respondents, however, indicated that the average cost for the certificate itself was Rp13,204 and that actual expenditure on certification ranged from zero to Rp100,000 because of supplementary costs
The total average cost was Rp36,449 with the inclusion of other charges and was higher in urban and semi-urban areas than in rural areas
5 The majority (94.7%) of respondents who participated in the LAP said that the time, effort and expenses taken to obtain a certificate were small by comparison with the usefulness of the certificate
More than half felt that the certificate would be very useful, while 39% mentioned the low cost and the easy process as benefits
Approximately 70% of respondents believe that they now have greater security of tenure because a land certificate recognizes their ownership rights
6 The majority of respondents (89.7%) said that there was no discrimination against women landholders during the LAP process
However, survey data reveal a strong tendency for the husband's name to be put on the certificate in cases where land has been purchased jointly by husband and wife after marriage
In 70.9% of cases the husband's name has been used, with only 16.9% in the wife's name and 3% in both names
The tendency is somewhat greater in urban areas than in rural areas
The reason given by the majority (86%) of respondents for this trend was that the decision about the name to go on the certificate was made by husband and wife together
BPN officials, however, stated that they used the name written on a deed of sale or a receipt in preparing LAP certificates for purchased land
7 Information from key informants indicated that there are Indonesian citizens of Chinese ethnic origin in survey LAP areas and that they had been obliged to meet one additional requirement in the form of proof of citizenship when submitting LAP applications
8 The proportion of the average number of land parcels certificated through the LAP in all quintiles of per capita household expenditures is greater than 90%
This indicates that systematic land registration touched all socio-economic groups within the community
9 With expansion in land titling through the LAP, there has been a net impact in the form of an average increase of 12.8% in the mortgaging of land with certificates as collateral
The highest impact was in rural areas (28.4%), followed by semi-urban (13.4%) and urban (2.5%)
Analysis by monthly per capita household expenditure reveals a U-shaped pattern in the impact on the use of certificates to obtain credits
The highest impact (15.2%) occurs among respondents in Quintile 1 and the second highest is in Quintile 5 (14.7%), while the lowest is in Quintile 3 (9%)
10 The average net impact of LAP certification on investment in land improvements is estimated to be 5.3%
The highest impact (12.3%) was found in rural areas
Comparative figures for urban and semi-urban areas are both around 3.5%
Most of the improvements consisted of the building or repair of houses, but in a few cases they took the form of a change in land use, with rice-fields being replaced by a house
11 Systematic land titling through the LAP has had a net impact of a 1.7% increase on the extent of land transactions in the survey locations
The type of land most commonly sold has been home-lots followed by non-irrigated land
12 In the perception of respondents, the net impact of LAP certificates on the value of land was an average increase of 64.5% on land prices
The highest impact (133.2%) has occurred in urban areas
While in semi urban areas was 32.8% and in rural areas was 64.6%
13 Survey data indicate that the LAP caused the PBB tax to rise by an average of 33.2%
The highest increase was in urban areas and the lowest in semi-urban locations
There were no increases in village levies and no new fees or charges were introduced
14 Two aspects of the wider impact of the LAP were mentioned by key informants
The first is the establishment of new offices by notaries in sub-district towns where LAP land titling has taken place, which implies that there is now more demand for notarial services
The second is the decline that has occurred in village and subdistrict revenues, since fewer land transactions are now handled at these levels
15 One effect of the LAP on nearby villages has been increased awareness of the benefits of certification
There is, however, no indication that the LAP has encouraged an increase in sporadic land registration, the cost of which has always been very high
For that reason many communities are attempting to establish a swadaya (self-help) system of land titling that would be somewhat more expensive than the LAP yet much cheaper than sporadic registration
16 Some 94% of respondents said that the cost of LAP certification was no burden on household finances
The majority (78.9%) feel that, if the cost of the certificate has to be raised, it should be no more than Rp50,000, or Rp90,000 if supplementary charges are included
This is much lower than amounts quoted by certain control group respondents who, in planning for swadaya certification, have proposed Rp150,000 to Rp350,000 per parcel
Many feel that the cost of a certificate should be related to the size of the land parcel, while others suggest stratified charges that would reflect the size and location of the land, proximity to transport and the other factors
I INTRODUCTION 
1.1 General background 
The Indonesian Land Administration Project (LAP) supported a program of accelerated registration of land rights, technical and other assistance to the National Land Agency (Badan Pertanahan Nasional or BPN), 
and a review of the legal and policy context for land administration
The registration program recorded land parcels and tenure rights in the national register (Buku Tanah) kept by the BPN and issued certificates (Sertifikat Tanah) to the registered owners
The program has involved systematic land certification and was designed to offer a service that is cheaper, faster and simpler than the sporadic registration program conducted by the BPN
The objectives of the program were to improve tenure security, reduce land conflicts, promote efficient land markets, facilitate access to credit with title as collateral and provide incentives for long-term investment in land and sustainable land use
The main product of the LAP is a land book entry in a local government land office (as part of the National Land Register) and a land certificate, which is given to the landholder
In most cases this certificate is for freehold (hak milik), but in the Capital Territory of Jakarta it is a certificate for leasehold only (hak guna bangunan)
The LAP has now been under implementation for six years
After two years of small-scale pilot work, systematic land certification began on a large scale in Project Year 3 (1996/97), focusing on West Java
In the following years implementation has been carried out in Jakarta, the Special Area of Yogyakarta and the Provinces of West Java, Central Java and East Java
In 1999 LAP certification was extended to regions off Java with the introduction of pilot projects in the urban areas of Palembang (South Sumatra) and Medan (North Sumatra)
In September and October 1999 a Social Assessment (SA) of the LAP land certification program was undertaken by the World Bank to provide an important input to the mid-term review of the project, which was conducted in November 1999
The SA used participatory field research methodology in which beneficiaries were asked to provide views on the implementation of the LAP and the impact of the certification itself
To provide more input to the World Bank and the Government of Indonesia, an Impact Evaluation of Systematic Land Titling under LAP (IE-SLT) was undertaken at the request of the World Bank Office, Jakarta, between January and May 2002
This research report documents the findings of the IE-SLT study
1.2 Research Aim The aim of the IE-SLT study is to collect and then to analyze field evidence of the impact of the land registration program on beneficiaries by measuring changes in certain indicators
The general objectives of the IE-SLT are (i) to assess the economic and social impacts of systematic land certification/titling under the LAP, (ii) to examine the ways in which the process of implementation of systematic land certification has affected outcomes, and (iii) to consider policy conclusions and implications for further policy development
The IE-SLT has focused on the following questions
In the areas covered by the IE-SLT, what groups have benefited from the land certification program and what groups have not
How did the selection of sites influence targeting of the program
What are the observed benefits and costs of land certification for those who participated in the program
Has systematic land certification resulted in increased security of land holdings
Has it resulted in the development of land markets
Has it provided an incentive for investments in land
Has it increased access to credit
Has it increased costs for the landholder, such as those arising from fees and taxes
Has the program had an impact on the perceived value of land
What differences are there in perceived benefits, comparing poor and better-off landholders, women and men
What are the wider social and economic impacts of the LAP according to the stakeholders included in the survey
What is the differential impact of the LAP in terms of gender, that is, how did women benefit or were they impacted negatively
To what extent are women's names formally included on LAP certificates
What has happened to land that has been inherited individually by women from their families
Has it remained in the woman's name or has it been transferred to the husband's name
1.3 Methodology 
A quantitative survey supplemented by in-depth interviews was used in the study
Questionnaires were used in data collection for the quantitative survey, while an interview guideline was prepared for in-depth interviews
The preparatory stage of the study, which began in early January 2002, took a month
Preparations included the examination of secondary sources, general discussions and the development of questionnaires and guidelines, selection of the administrative districts (kabupaten) and cities (kota) where research would be conducted, recruitment and training of regional enumerators and the field testing of methodology in an urban area in Jakarta and in a rural part of Tangerang District
A workshop with relevant agencies, including BPN and BAPPENAS as well as NGOs, was held prior to commencement of the survey to obtain further inputs to preparatory work
Using data from BPN in Jakarta, the IE-SLT research team selected 14 districts and cities/towns purposively, proportional to the number of LAP certificates already issued and the year of certification (see Annex 1.1)
Research sub-districts (kecamatan) were then selected purposively
In the identification of sub-districts a distinction was made between areas that are urban, those that are rural and those that can be described as semi-urban or peri-urban, that is, places that are close to the administrative boundaries of cities yet still retain many of the characteristics of rural areas
Within the chosen sub-districts, specific kelurahan and desa were selected purposively as research sites using the same criterion of rural, semi-urban and urban conditions
Villages included in the 1999 Social Assessment were intentionally not selected
Annex 1.2 gives details of the location of the 14 research sites, while a description of each site is given in Annex 1.3
Some 1,596 household respondents, of whom 508 formed a control group, were chosen randomly
In each of the 14 survey locations, approximately 112 households were interviewed
The treatment respondents are those who own land and received a certificate for that land under the LAP
The control group consists of landholders who may have been eligible to obtain a certificate but could not do so because the LAP was not carried out in their area
The control group was drawn from a neighboring area which, based on the assessment of the interviewers, has demographic, economic and land use characteristics similar to those of the treatment group
The purpose of the control group was to enable changes resulting from the LAP to be pinpointed
Several key informants were also interviewed in each area
These informants included the head of the district-level BPN and his staff as well as the staff of district heads (bupati), mayors (walikota) and sub-district heads (camat)
At a lower level interviews were held with village and kelurahan heads, and the heads of hamlets, administrative wards (RW) and neighborhoods (RT), both past and present
Also included as informants were prominent community figures, and the staff of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), banks and credit institutions
SMERU assembled eight field teams, each consisting of four members and a supervisor who was directly involved in data collection
Each team was made up of an equal number of men and women to ensure that the team members could talk with both men and women
Some 32 regional enumerators were involved during the three weeks of fieldwork
II CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SURVEY SAMPLE 
2.1 Characteristics of respondents 
2.1.1 Categories of respondents The present survey covered 1,596 respondent households (referred to in the present report as respondents), which were divided into three categories
1 LAP participants; 
2 Non-participants, that is, households that had the opportunity but did not participate in the LAP; and 
3 The control group, that is, households that had no opportunity to participate in the LAP
The first category (1004 respondents) refers to households which reside in a research village or kelurahan and in which at least one member obtained a LAP certificate for a land parcel in the village or kelurahan concerned, irrespective of whether the parcel is still owned or has been sold
Throughout the report they referred to as participants
The second category consists of 84 households that did not take the opportunity to apply for a LAP certificate or else failed to obtain a LAP certificate for some reason, even though LAP certification was carried out in the area where they live
These households own no land in the sample village with a certificate obtained through sporadic registration or other land registration program like Prona
They were interviewed in order to obtain insights into why some people who were presumably eligible for a land certificate did not participate in the LAP
Throughout the present report they are referred to as non-participants
The third category, referred to as the control group, consists of 508 households that live in a research site and own land without a certificate of any kind but had no opportunity to participate in the LAP because their village or kelurahan (or the section in which they live) was not included in the area designated for LAP implementation
The purpose in including non-beneficiaries was to enable a comparison to be made with LAP beneficiaries to net out the impact of LAP certificates on various social and economic indicators
2.1.2 Selection of respondent households 
After site selection had been completed, hamlets or RWs (equal in status to a hamlet) and then RTs in which households would be chosen were selected purposively
In each research site (village or kelurahan) at least three and no more than five widely scattered hamlets or RWs were chosen
Within each hamlet or RW, two or three non-adjacent RTs were then selected (see Annex 2.1)
A total of 75 LAP households had to be selected in each site
The Daftar Luas Ajudikasi, that is, the list of land parcels that had been measured and recorded by the private surveying contractors, was used for this purpose
Household names were chosen from the list at random, with five additional names, in case replacements were needed for people who were not at home at the time of the visit
This list should have been available in each village but in several places it was not
In these situations a system of intervals between houses was used (systematic random sampling)
If, for example, six respondent households had to be chosen from 30 households, every fifth house was selected
At the same time a few households were included in which no person had participated in the LAP, even though the opportunity had been offered
These persons were identified with the help of the head of the local RT
In the case of control group respondent households, there was no list of names from which a selection could be made since, by definition, a control village or kelurahan was one in which LAP adjudication had not been undertaken
Because lists of residents could not be provided by local authorities, households were also selected using systematic random sampling from houses in different parts of the study site
Persons living on state land (tanah negara) were not included in the selection of these households
2.1.3 Definition of respondents 
In the present study respondents are defined as the households from which information concerning implementation of the LAP was sought
While the household member who provided information for completion of the questionnaire was not always the person who owned the land in question, 
that member lived in the same house and in almost all instances (97.7%) was closely related
In the majority of cases (93.1%) the household member was the household head himself/herself or the spouse
Table 2.1 gives details
In most cases the household head was a man
There were, however, a number of femaleheaded households where the husband was either deceased or else no longer living in the house because of divorce or separation (Table 2.2)
There were no cases in which a female household head had a husband
2.1.4 Location of respondent households 
Table 2.3 shows the distribution of the 1,596 survey respondent households by district and province
West Java has the highest number of research sites (five) and respondent households (36.4%) because, as already noted, the number of research sites selected per province was in proportion to the number of LAP certificates issued during the period under examination
Table 2.4 shows the distribution of respondent households by the type of region in which they live
A distinction has been made in the present study between urban, semi-urban and rural regions, even though the government and the Central Bureau of Statistics differentiate only between urban and rural areas
As explained in section 1.3, semi-urban areas are those that are close to the administrative boundaries of towns and cities yet still retain many of the characteristics of rural areas
Since the selection of semi-urban sites was based on information from district and sub-district authorities, these sites were chosen in a somewhat subjective way
It was important to include semi-urban locations, however, since an examination of BPN data in Jakarta had shown a clear tendency for LAP activities to be concentrated in sub-districts and villages on the periphery of urban areas
This was in keeping with the general criteria outlined by the National Land Agency itself for the selection of LAP implementation areas, which is discussed in Section 3.1 below
2.1.5 Characteristics of sample households Table 2.5 presents information about respondent households and household heads in each category of respondents and indicates the extent to which the three groups are comparable
Households in the non-participant category, who had the opportunity to participant in the LAP but did not, would appear to be the worst off in many respects
This group has the lowest average expenditures and the largest household size
At the same time it has more female-headed households than the other two groups and the lowest overall levels of education
While figures for employment in agriculture and services do not differ much across the three groups, the non-participant group has a noticeably larger proportion of household heads employed in trade
Table 2.6 shows the nature of housing, amenities and household possessions among all categories of respondents
Although non-participant households have the largest average floor area, this group is clearly the poorest in quality of housing if the material used in roofing, walls and flooring is used as an indicator
While electricity is available to virtual all respondent households, just over 25 percent of non-participant households do not use gas or kerosene as energy source for cooking
This suggests that they use wood, which is generally cheaper
The fact that only 62 per cent of these households have access to relatively good water for bathing perhaps explains why this group has the highest percentage for use of bottled or purified drinking water
As far as household possessions are concerned, households in this group are also below the other groups in every indicator
At the same time respondents in this category have the smallest average number of land parcels and the lowest average total area of land
There is no reason for the apparent relative poverty of these households since they were not chosen purposively
They live among households in areas where the LAP was implemented
This means that there are no locational distinctions, unlike the control group households, which live in areas that are spatially separated from those of LAP beneficiaries
It is therefore possible that these indicators, which suggest economic disadvantage, reveal something about households that did not participate in the LAP
2.2 Characteristics of land parcels 
2.2.1 Area and land use LAP titling was done on the basis of individual land parcels
This is reflected in Table 2.7, which shows the average number and size of all land parcels, including uncertificated parcels, held by survey respondents
The figures in this table include land owned elsewhere, irrespective of whether or not it was in a LAP implementation area
Since many respondent households in all three categories own more than one parcel, the number of parcels exceeds the number of respondent households
In implementation of land titling, non-contiguous pieces of land held by the same owner were treated as separate parcels and separate certificates were issued
The differences between provinces reflect the nature of the particular sites (urban, semi-urban and rural) where the survey was conducted
Thus the small average number and size of parcels recorded for all groups in South and North Sumatra are explained by the fact that the LAP had been conducted in relatively densely populated urban areas (kelurahan) within provincial capitals
The absence of non-participant figures for Jakarta in Table 2.7 shows that in the two LAP survey sites in this province, all who were interviewed had obtained LAP certificates
Table 2.8 shows the average number and size of parcels by type of region and land use
As might be expected, almost all urban land parcels are used as home-lots, that is, land on which a house of some kind has been built (pekarangan)
Very few parcels involve agriculture or other uses
Where there are other uses, they consist mainly of aquaculture in the form of brackish fish-ponds (tambak) in coastal areas or freshwater fish-ponds further inland
Respondents in semi-urban areas have slightly more land parcels used as home-lots than those in urban and rural areas (1.40 by contrast with 1.20 and 1.23 respectively), 
while the average area (975.2 sq meters) is much larger than the average of 229.1 sq meters in urban and 751.6 sq meters in rural areas
Some of this home-lot land is very probably used for small businesses such as vehicle repair workshops
Many respondents in the semi-urban group own rice-fields and other agricultural land, but rural respondents have the largest parcels of farm land, although the average number of parcels (1.98 per respondent) is not much greater than the average of 1.97 for semiurban areas
Even so, the total average area of agricultural land owned by rural respondents is somewhat greater than the equivalent in semi-urban areas
These figures reflect the fact that there is still agricultural land, both irrigated and non-irrigated, in semi-urban areas, while in rural areas the number and size of land parcels is not very large
Given the fragmentation of holdings that has occurred in most rural areas in recent years, each parcel is likely to be relatively small
2.2.2 Land parcels with LAP certification Table 2.9 gives details of land parcels for which LAP certificates have been issued
Many of the 1,004 respondents own more than one parcel but some of these parcels were not situated in a LAP implementation area while others were not adequately documented and thus were not able to receive a LAP certificate
This explains why the figures for certificated parcels are smaller than those for total number of parcels
The average number of total land parcels and area of land parcels is highest in the Special Area of Yogyakarta, as is the equivalent for parcels certificated through the LAP
The figures shown in Table 2.10 suggest that, when LAP certification was being carried out, a distinction was made between land parcels by type of land use and that the focus in titling was on home-lots rather than agricultural land
This is in accordance with statements from a number of key informants, who said that preference was given to land used for housing as there was a limit of around 5,000 on the number of certificates available per target location (kelurahan or village)
III THE LAP CERTIFICATION PROCESS 
3.1 Choice of location for the LAP According to key informants from Land Offices at different levels and in different provinces, the sub-districts and villages in which the land certification program is implemented are chosen by the Land Office at district (kabupaten) and city or town (kota) level
The list of locations is then forwarded to the provincial-level Land Office, which passes it on to the National Land Agency (BPN) in Jakarta
A Letter of Decision is issued in Jakarta and sent back to the provincial office, confirming the selection
In deciding about locations, the district-level Land Office is guided by BPN policy
Guidelines prepared at national level contain a list of priority areas
These are locations where
- no more than 30 % of land parcels have certificates obtained through sporadic registration or other land registration programs like Prona; - rapid urbanization is taking place in the sense that the built-up area is expanding; - there is a lot of buying and selling of land through village officials or notaries; - parcels without certificates are contiguous rather than widely dispersed; - low-income households are in the majority; - basic village maps are available; and - technical control points in the national projection system already exist
Local requirements have sometimes been added
There are wide variations in the nature of these local criteria, but one is usually the absence of any major disputes over land within the community or between the community and other government agencies
In particular, areas where there are issues involving tanah negara have been avoided
The Jakarta BPN office normally accepts the locations chosen at district level
Very few cases were mentioned during in-depth interviews of changes in sites being made at any level
In a small number of cases a regional government (Pemda at provincial or district) has requested that specific sub-districts and villages be included in the land titling program for certain reasons
This happened, for example, in a number of places in the period before the General Elections
In other places the village head (lurah) lobbied in advance to have the district-level Land Office include his village in the LAP program
The reverse, however, has happened in some places
In a village chosen as a control site for the present survey, local officials had specifically requested that their village not be included in the LAP because of the negative effect that this would have on village revenue obtained from land transactions
The survey found that the priorities set by BPN for LAP locations have very largely been observed in the research areas
On the whole, semi-urban areas have been favored, the reason being that urbanization is transforming them in such a way that local people need the security of tenure that a land certificate gives
Villages adjacent to tourist areas are also among those chosen for the LAP as they are likely to expand in population and economic activity
Within these areas there has been a clear bias towards locations in which most households are not well off
Land Office decision-makers feel that people who are in a strong economic position can afford to register their land through the sporadic system
In any case, there is usually a high level of awareness of the importance of a certificate among financially better-off landholders
By contrast, people from low-income households are usually nervous about the cost of sporadic certification and often do not even know how to go about registration
Most of the LAP villages, including research sites, in Karangpandan Sub-district (Central Java), for example, had been included in a government program for poverty alleviation in left-behind villages (the IDT program)
Because of the poverty of landholders, the land was never likely to be registered with the Land Office
At the same time educational levels in these villages are very low and understanding of the value of land certification is correspondingly limited
3.2 Socialization of the LAP 
Information from respondents indicated that socialization of the LAP followed a similar pattern in most areas and was conducted at two levels, that of the village administration and that of the RT or neighborhood
At village level the Adjudication Team usually held at least one meeting, to which village officials, heads of hamlets, RWs and RTs, members of the Village Community Institute (LMD) and prominent community figures and religious leaders were invited
Dissemination of information among the intended beneficiaries was done at RT level
In addition to formal community meetings, most RT heads undertook specific socialization by visiting the homes of people who were unable to attend these gatherings
At the same time information about the LAP was passed on by word of mouth, and was repeated at almost every community gathering, such as Friday prayers and religious study meetings
Thus most members of the community knew about the LAP before implementation began
The survey recorded the sources from which respondents in urban, semi-urban and rural areas obtained information about the LAP
The role played by lower-level, unsalaried village officials, in particular by RT heads, in socialization is evident from Table 3.1
More than 90% of respondents stated that they had received sufficient information about the requirements that had to be met
Only half of the respondents, however, obtained this information at formal meetings (Table 3.2)
Information was also passed on informally by word of mouth during conversations with friends and neighbors
Brochures, banners and other types of printed announcement played a relatively insignificant role in the dissemination of information because they were usually displayed in the village administrative office where only people who had a specific reason for visiting the office were likely to see them
When meetings were held, it was almost invariably the household head (male in 93.4% of cases) who was invited
In only a few cases were couples (husband and wife) invited, but slightly more attended than were invited
While most members of the community knew about the LAP before implementation began, a number of respondents in Bandung, Bekasi, Tangerang and Malang said that they learned about the LAP only when surveyors arrived to measure their land
The reasons were that the persons concerned were away from home at the time of socialization or else lived in a remote part of the village
In Tangerang and Palembang a few people said that they did not bother to attend socialization meetings because they doubted that the certification program would eventuate because information was so unclear
Among urban non-participants who had the opportunity to participate, however, a high proportion (42.9%) heard about the LAP only from relatives, friends or neighbors, 
which suggests that lack of adequate information could have been a reason for non-participation
The extent to which socialization was undertaken also depended on the target set by the BPN at central and district levels for the number of certificates to be issued
Several respondents in Pekalongan stated that socialization had been intentionally limited by village authorities because the number of certificates available was less than the number required to meet demand among landholders
This was done to avoid dissatisfaction among the community
On the other hand, if the number of certificates exceeded demand, socialization was focused on achieving the set target and more attention was given to disseminating information and helping applicants to provide the required documentation
In villages in certain districts, especially Karanganyar and Yogyakarta, special committees were formed at hamlet level and consisted of the hamlet head, RW/RT heads and community figures
The task of each committee was to provide information, to collect the documents put forward by applicants and to check whether they were complete
The committee then took the documents to the base camp of the Adjudication Team
In most places where there was a special committee, its members also supervised the installation of boundary markers for individual land parcels, the aim being to prevent any misunderstandings or disputes during surveying
This meant that in actual fact they ratified boundaries in advance
Survey information on this point is not entirely clear, however, since respondents found it hard to differentiate between a special committee and the regular RW, RT and hamlet staff
3.3 Management of the LAP process 
As with socialization, it was the RT heads who did most of the work in organizing LAP implementation at community level, especially in urban and semi-urban areas (Table 3.3)
As a consequence the community tended to regard the head of their RT as a go-between in communications with the Adjudication Team
Handling of applications was usually done on a collective basis in the sense that individuals gave their documents to the RT head
After RT head checking to make sure that they were in order and arranging to have supplementary documentation provided at village level, he passed them on to the Adjudication Team
Those who did not do so submitted their documents direct to the Adjudication Team at its base camp
Repondents usually had to go back and forth several times to the house of the RT head, however, while getting their documents ready
The role of the village head, meanwhile, consisted of providing written statements about lost and missing documents, verifying photocopies and issuing or renewing identification cards where necessary
3.4 Requirements to obtain a LAP certificate 
On the whole, the survey found no evidence that the requirements for a LAP application favored or disadvantaged any particular group in the community
The documents that applicants needed consisted of proof of ownership in the form of a traditional land document (Leter C or girik) or deed of sale together with other documents such as personal identification cards (KTP), household cards (KK) and proof of payment of the PBB tax as stipulated in BPN guidelines
People in rural and semi-urban areas were more easily able to provide proof of ownership than those in urban areas since village officials in these districts could trace ownership through the traditional system of land records and prepare copies of missing documents
In Sidoluhur (Sleman District), for example, approximately 30% of landholders no longer had their original document but it was easily replaced
In urban areas, where land had been more commonly purchased than inherited and proof took the form of deeds of sale (akte jual beli) or sales receipts, it was much harder to check on inadequately supported ownership claims
At village level local authorities, with the agreement of Adjudication Teams, made it as easy as possible for applicants to meet LAP stipulations about documents
For example, if a KTP or KK had expired, it could be easily extended with a stamp from the village head
If a person had lived for some time in the village but did not have a KTP, he could obtain a special one or else a letter could be prepared by the village head identifying the person concerned
In Malang the village head even visited households carrying with him the village stamp in case it was needed
Where necessary, death certificates and wills showing subdivision of land among heirs were prepared as well as statements that the names of heirs had been registered in village records
It was more difficult for people to meet these requirements, especially in rural and semi-urban areas, since very few people make written wills or obtain death certificates for deceased parents
This meant that such documents had to be prepared, or at least statements had to be signed by the village head verifying information of this kind from LAP applicants
In many areas a written statement from the lurah that the land was not under dispute was also required
Supplementary documentation of this kind, however, incurred special charges, which raised the cost of land certification for most respondents
In Burangkeng village in Bekasi, to save applicants the cost and trouble of getting photocopies of KTP and KK, the village head decided that it was sufficient just to show the actual KTP and KK or to enclose them with the application, to be returned when the applicant collected his/her certificate
Because of flexibility of this kind and the readiness of village officials to help with supplementary documents, 97% of all respondents, irrespective of urban, semi-urban or rural location, said that they had experienced no difficulty during LAP implementation in meeting requirements for certification of their land
3.5 The handling of disputes 
Information obtained from respondents during the survey showed that disputes occurred in only 30 cases (that is, just under 2% of the 1,542 LAP land parcels that were described by respondents) and were easily settled
Almost half of the 30 cases occurred in semi-urban areas
Respondents gave reasons for the disputes in only 18 cases; 12 of these involved disagreements over boundaries between adjacent parcels
A few disputes arose over the subdivision of inherited land among heirs, while in other cases the land had already been registered in another person's name or else there were multiple claims to the same land
Disputes were normally settled within the community or the family concerned, often with the assistance of the RT and other village officials, since potential beneficiaries realized that certificates would not be issued if conflicts remained unsettled
Given the methodology of the present survey, it was impossible for researchers to ascertain the extent to which unsolved disputes prevented people from participating (see 3.8 below)
According to key informants, it had been hoped that problems concerning land ownership would be solved through the LAP
This hope was realized but only in cases where boundaries between parcels had been unclear for some time before the LAP was undertaken
The disputes that could not be solved usually concerned inheritances and the Adjudication Teams made no attempt to solve them, as they were afraid that the time taken to do so would hold up progress on program implementation
In these cases they advised the individuals concerned to settle the matter themselves or else to go to the law court
Meanwhile, those persons could not be included as LAP participants
3.6 The cost of LAP certification 
Costs have been divided into three categories
(1) the cost of the certificate; (2) the cost of the whole certification process (including charges for supplementary documentation); and (3) additional costs incurred when the certificate was ready to be collected
Most respondents had difficulty in recalling details of exactly how much money they had spent to obtain a LAP certificate
As a result, information about the cost of the certificate itself could be obtained for only 521 parcels of land
These respondents believed the official cost of a certificate to have been between Rp10,000 and Rp13,500 per parcel
The average proved to be Rp13,204 or just on 53 % of total outlay on certification (Table 3.4)
Information about the total cost was available for 1,513 parcels
Costs ranged from zero to Rp100,000 and were higher in urban and semi-urban areas than in rural areas
The highest cost was in Medan (North Sumatra) and the lowest in Central Java
Respondents mentioned cases where village officials had obtained a certificate at no cost to themselves since the supplementary charges imposed for other applicants covered the cost of their own individual certificates
At the same time there were instances, especially in South Sumatra and West Java, where a few extremely poor people, usually widows, paid nothing at all because of this same subsidy
Wide variations occurred not just at provincial and district level but in RTs and RWs within the same village or kelurahan, because additional charges were usually agreed upon at RT/RW level through direct discussion with the community
This was particularly evident in West Java and Jakarta
No evidence was found that the figure of Rp2,500 per parcel set by BPN for certificates in rural areas was observed
As Table 3.5 shows, the cost of the certificate itself was 3.4 times the official price
The majority of respondents and even key informants were not aware of this distinction, which should make the cost of a rural certificate considerably lower than the Rp11,500 set for urban areas
Similarly, most were not aware that since 1999/2000 no charge at all has been imposed for LAP certificates except payment of the Fee for Acquisition of Rights to Land and Buildings (BPHTB or Bea Perolehan Atas Hak Tanah dan Bangunan)
Charges for the supplementary documentation referred to in section 3.4 were relatively high in all areas
The reason given by key informants for imposition of charges outside the official price was to cover certain needs at the time of LAP implementation
These consisted of administration costs (connected with the provision of additional documentation) and operational costs, which meant food and accommodation for government officials while in the field
In some locations, however, the raising of funds for purposes unrelated to the LAP, like the improvement of local pathways (in Depok) and the construction of a subdistrict meeting hall (in Gresik)
Thus the average figure of Rp13,204 per certificate becomes Rp35,067 when supplementary costs are included
Some 10% of respondents said that they had also paid additional money when certificates were completed but that such payment was usually voluntary
Many beneficiaries, for example, gave a small sum of money to the head of the RT in recognition of his assistance (Table 3.6)
A number also said that they had given additional money to BPN officials and Adjudication Team members
It was difficult, however, to obtain a breakdown of payments actually made by respondents to these persons
In South Jakarta and Depok an additional charge that could not be avoided was imposed on beneficiaries because certificates were handed over to them in a specially prepared folder
A charge of Rp10,000 to Rp12,500 was made at the time when the certificate was ready to be collected from the village head
These post-certification costs bring the total average cost of LAP titling to Rp36,449 per certificate (Table 3.7)
In 94.2% of cases LAP beneficiaries paid for certification from their own savings
Only 0.7% had to sell assets to meet the cost
Assets sold were mainly in the form of jewelry but a few respondents sold poultry and goats
Others obtained the necessary money from adult children or close relatives
No significant differences could be detected between provinces in this matter
Most respondents said that they did not object to the official cost of the certificate and even the additional charges because, by comparison with sporadic registration, these costs were small and the LAP process was not difficult
Even so, there were cases where respondents felt that village officials had misused money and that there should have been more transparency in the purposes for which supplementary charges were made
3.7 Length of time and errors on certificates 
The average length of time taken for the LAP certification process, from submission of documents to distribution of certificates, for the 1,542 land parcels described by respondents was 2.2 months
Generally, the time taken was one month (30% of parcels), two months (28%) and three months (36%); in 6% of cases the time was 4 months or more
The shortest length of time was an average of 1.9 months in rural areas and the longest 2.3 months in semiurban areas
Respondents in Karawang District received their certificates in only 1.2 months
Only 8% of the 1,535 land certificates for which the owner gave a response had some kind of error
Most (64.2%) of these errors involved wrong measurements of the land in the opinion of the beneficiaries, who found that the size of the parcel shown on the LAP certificate was not the same as the area indicated on the PBB tax form or on a deed of purchase
In 17.9% of cases the parcel was wrongly located (that is, there was a mistake in the street name or the number of the RW or RT)
Some 12.2% had the wrong name as the owner and 5.7 % had other errors such as the wrong stamp on them (that is, a stamp not from the Adjudication Team but from the local Land Office)
Just on two-thirds of the respondents who found that their certificate contained an error did nothing to have it corrected because they regarded it as insignificant
The others (33.6%) lodged a complaint either with village officials or else with the Adjudication Team or the district Land Office
Where the error was rectified, the average time taken was 26 days while the range was from one day to six months
3.8 Reasons for not participating in the LAP 
In most of the survey sites where the LAP had been implemented, a few households had not participated in the program and hence had not received a certificate
All told, 84 such cases (7.7%) were encountered from among the 1,088 respondents in the LAP areas
Of these, 69 respondents said that they had had an opportunity to participate, while 15 said that they had had no such opportunity
As Table 3.8 shows, the reasons for non-participation were quite diverse
Lack of money and inadequate documentation were the two reasons most often cited by the 53 respondents in the former category
The other reasons included cases in Sleman and Karanganyar where people owned such an extremely small piece of land that they felt that the value did not warrant the cost of certification, even though that cost was low
In some places, notably Tangerang and Palembang, people did not believe that the LAP would eventuate and so did not bother to submit an application for land registration
Other reasons for not participating in the LAP are as follows
One respondent was in the process of selling his land and had not yet subdivided the girik and the PBB document at the time when the LAP was conducted in his village
Another had a similar problem in that he was in the process of buying land but had not finalized documentation with the previous owner
In Tangerang, where the allocation of LAP certificates was insufficient, a few respondents did not participate because village authorities had told them that the cost of LAP certification would exceed Rp 100,000 per parcel, which was a lot more than the persons concerned could afford
In other places some people chose not to participate in the LAP because of negative experiences with Prona in the past
In Medan, for example, respondents said that the Prona process had proved expensive and lengthy and in many instances certificates had never been issued, despite payment of part of the required money in advance
According to key informants, many of those who would have been eligible to obtain a LAP certificate but did not participate were absentee owners who could not be contacted by village authorities at the time of LAP implementation
They were usually, but not always, urban people who own land in semi-urban and rural areas
In the research site in the city of Bandung, for example, there were instances of people who live in large towns like Tasikmalaya, more than 100 km away, but own land in this urban area
Such persons are not among survey respondents for the very reason that they reside outside the research sites, even though their land is located in these areas
While the proportion could therefore not be estimated, the data in Box 3.4, provided by village officials in Bunut Wetan, illustrate the possible magnitude and the implications of absentee ownership for the land registration program
A somewhat different explanation for non-participation was given by village officials in semiurban areas like Bekasi
Certain residents with large land holdings felt that they would have difficulty in splitting the certificate if they wished to sell only a portion of a land parcel
The LAP certificate would have to be replaced by two new certificates through sporadic registration at the district Land Office, which would be a costly and time-consuming process, particularly since it would fall into the category of a second registration
In their perception, sale of part of the land and registration of the remaining part by the owner would be easier and cheaper if there was no existing certificate
As noted above, 15 of the 84 non-participant respondents stated that they had had no opportunity to apply for a LAP certificate, even though the program had been conducted in their kelurahan
In Palembang, where budel land involving rights granted by the colonial government more than half a century ago was involved, agreement could not be reached between the present occupants and the descendants of the original owners, who were renting out this special-status land to them
There were also problems with proof of claims to tanah usaha, which in this particular site refers to land originally obtained from the clearing of forest on an individual basis
A similar situation occurred in Medan where many people are renting land from the heirs of persons who had received the land from the Grand Sultan a few generations ago
Several respondents said that they have been renting the land on a yearly basis for between 30 and 60 years
They have even built houses on the land but are unwilling to renovate or make additions to their homes for fear of ultimately facing eviction (see Site descriptions numbers 13 and 14 in Annex 1.3)
IV THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF THE LAP 
4.1 Benefits according to respondents 
Almost all respondents stated that the LAP certification program was of benefit to those who obtained land certificates
Some 98.4% of LAP participants who said that it was useful gave various reasons as shown in Table 4.1 below
Respondents who had received LAP certificates but said that the program was not of any benefit were almost always people who had never used their certificate for any specific purpose, such as bank collateral, and were unaware of any advantage to be gained from a land certificate
Possession of a land certificate has made people feel that their ownership rights are clearly recognized in the legal sense because the state, through the district-level Land Office, has given recognition to their claim to the land
Prior to LAP implementation, proof of ownership for the greater proportion of land in the research sites was still in the form of a girik (traditional land document), deed of sale or, in many cases, an ordinary receipt showing purchase of the land
All of these forms of proof were open to challenges from other persons who had a claim to the land in question
For many respondents this feeling of security also stemmed from the fact that the boundaries between adjacent parcels of land had become clear as a result of the technical measuring carried out by the surveyors and witnessed by the RT or RW head and the landholders concerned
This has made it possible for neighbors to avoid disputes
In the specific case of inherited land, respondents who are heirs feel safe from the possibility of claims from co-heirs because the land ownership document is no longer in the name of parents but in the name of the present owner
In all research areas respondents found the LAP to be a convenient means by which to subdivide inherited land, if subdivision had not already been done
A parcel of land that had previously been in the name of parents could be directly registered in the name of the various heirs
All that was needed was a photocopy of the identification card of each heir
If the parents were still living, registration was usually done by the parents themselves, while in situations where they were deceased, the heirs arranged matters together and then witnessed the measuring of each subdivision of the parcel by the surveyors
Several respondents said that the certificate could be used as collateral to obtain a bank loan, even though most had never used it for that purpose
In putting forward this reason, they were influenced by information from the Adjudication Team at the time when socialization of the program was being carried out and by the experience of other people who had made applications for credit in the past
Prior to the LAP, some banks like the BRI had been willing to accept collateral in the form of a girik (traditional land document) or a deed of sale, but the number was very limited
Since LAP certification all banks have been prepared to accept the certificate as collateral, provided that other requirements can be met
The following sections give details of the social and economic aspects of LAP impacts and cover the advantages of the certificate itself, the possibility of land alienation, access to credit, land values, taxes and levies
In many of the analyses the approach taken is to look at the differences in the changes between variables after and before the LAP in areas where the program was conducted and to compare them with the situation in control areas
This approach in analysis is intended to net out any possible influence from other factors
In the specific case of impact analysis, only one parcel of land has been used for each household
In LAP locations a parcel with a LAP certificate has been used, while in control locations a parcel without any kind of certificate has been used
If the respondent owns more than one parcel of land, the parcel that received special treatment such as use as collateral, informal mortgaging or sale has been chosen
If none of the parcels owned by the respondent has received special treatment, the one most valuable in the perception of the respondent has been selected
4.1.1 Advantages of a LAP certificate by comparison with expenditure 
The majority of respondents (94.7%) said the money, time and effort expended to obtain a certificate through the LAP were small by comparison with the advantages of having a certificate
Just over half of these respondents (50,1%) felt that the certificate itself would be very useful
Advantages included ownership proof, a feeling of security and access to credit
Some 39% mentioned the low cost and the easy process of LAP certification as benefits
These aspects were in contrast to the trouble, money and time taken to obtain a certificate through the sporadic program
As shown in Chapter 3, the average total cost of a LAP certificate was Rp36,449 per parcel and the average time taken was 2.2 months
Requirements were not difficult to meet and in many locations were even easier than stipulated
Also, applicants had to deal only with one team at village level
To obtain a certificate through sporadic registration would require personal handling of the application, much more money, a more difficult process, timeconsuming details and frequent trips back and forth to the district Land Office
Although the provincial-level Land Office in all regions had prepared its own rates for preparation of sporadic land certificates based on the size and condition of the land, the actual cost usually proved to be much greater while the process took more than one year
The experiences of a number of respondents and informants who had undertaken sporadic registration of their land are quoted here to illustrate the point
(1) In Jakarta, there were people who had spent two years trying to arrange registration but the certificate had not yet been issued
(2) In Bekasi, an informant obtained a certificate for 400 sq meters of land at a cost of Rp 1.4 million; the time taken was 1.5 years
(3) In Bandung, certificates for land under 500 sq meters cost between Rp 2 and 3 million and took years to obtain
(4) In Depok, an outlay of Rp 2 to 3 million was needed for a parcel measuring 100 sq meters
(5) In Sleman, a respondent had tried to obtain a land certificate before the LAP and had already paid Rp340,000 in advance but after a year he cancelled his application because the certificate was not finished; only Rp1,000 of his money was returned to him
4.1.2 Security of tenure 
Approximately 70% of respondents believe that they now have greater security of tenure as a land certificate recognizes their ownership rights
It was difficult, however, to link their confidence to the possibility of eviction for government or other projects that require land, since the survey found in all the survey sites, including control areas, that very little alienation of land has occurred since implementation of the LAP
This is a reflection of the state of the Indonesian economy, which in recent years has not favored investment in largescale construction projects
The survey recorded only six certificated parcels and one parcel without a certificate that were involved in alienation
In these cases the land was required for road development and expansion of a state-owned sugar-mill
Meanwhile, qualitative information in a number of research locations indicated that before the LAP was carried out, land was frequently alienated either for the construction and widening of roads or for housing developments
In one study site, for example, there is an area of 30 ha which had been alienated for a housing estate before the LAP began but to this day remains quite neglected
The difference found during the survey cannot be taken as an indicator that the possession of LAP certificates has made landowners quite safe from the possibility of eviction
Respondents living in one control site located close to an industrial estate, for example, very much hope to be able to obtain LAP certificates, as they feel that this would make their bargaining position far stronger if their area is ever affected by expansion in the industrial estate or if the government decides to establish new development projects
4.1.3 Access to credit 
Table 4.2 shows the percentage of LAP and control respondents who used their land as collateral for credits before and after LAP certification
From these data it can be seen that there was an increase after the LAP in the use of certificates as collateral in LAP locations, whereas in control areas the opposite tendency is evident
The difference between the differences in percentages for use as collateral in LAP and control areas is quite large
It is estimated that LAP certificates have increased the use of land as collateral for credits by as much as 12.8%
The percentage of LAP respondents who used a land document as collateral before the LAP is highest in semi-urban areas while urban and rural figures are the same
After the LAP was conducted, a change occurred and the percentage in rural areas became the highest, followed by semi-urban and urban areas
Overall, in the three types of region there has been a rise in the number of respondents who have used their land as collateral since the LAP, with the greatest jump in rural areas, that is, from 4.1% to 30.7% or an increase of around seven times
The opposite has occurred in control locations, where both before and after the LAP the percentage has been highest in rural areas, followed by semi-urban and urban areas
In semiurban and rural areas in control areas there has been a drop of 1.8% but in urban areas there has been a slight increase (0.6%)
It cannot be concluded that the increase in the use of land documents as collateral in LAP locations is attributable to LAP certification because of the presence of a number of other factors such as improvements in the general business climate
To identify the effects of the LAP, a comparison is now made between changes in LAP areas and changes in control areas
From the last column of Table 4.3 it can be seen that there is a significant difference of 12.8% in the use of certificates as collateral
This figure shows the percentage of increase as a consequence of the LAP
The highest increase was in rural areas (28.4%), followed by semiurban (13.4%) and urban (2.4%)
This situation can be explained to a certain extent by the sources of livelihood of the families
From Table 4.3 it can be seen that in urban and semi-urban regions most respondents are employed in the services sector, that is, as drivers of vehicles, small boats, ojek and pedicabs and as unskilled wage laborers
In rural areas, however, the majority is employed in the agricultural sector
Employment in the services sector usually does not require the person concerned to have his own capital
The opposite applies in agriculture, however, where farm inputs have to be purchased
Data for trade, which also requires capital, vary somewhat between regions but show a similar trend
The field of employment is relevant to access to bank credit, because banks generally require a credit applicant to have a viable business
In both LAP and control locations more than 90% of households chose a banking institution as the place to obtain a loan with their land documents as collateral
The BRI is the bank most frequently used, very largely because it is the only bank that has had a branch in every sub-district capital since the 1980s and the community is therefore familiar with it
It is interesting to note that the rate of borrowing with collateral of this kind is highest in rural regions and the increase as a consequence of the LAP has also been the highest in these regions
The opposite has occurred in urban areas
This phenomenon does away with the belief that village communities are reluctant to have any contact with the formal banking world
From the point of view of per capita household expenditure in LAP and control areas before and after the LAP, the percentage of respondents using land documents as collateral tends to rise as household expenditure increases (see Table 4.2)
In LAP locations the difference between before-LAP and after-LAP figures is greatest in the highest expenditure quintile (13.8%) followed by the lowest quintile (12.0%)
In the control areas the difference is negative in the two lowest and the highest quintiles, which means that a decrease has occurred in this variable
The influence of the LAP on the increase in use of certificates as collateral, as revealed by the difference in the differences between LAP and control sites, can be seen in the U-shaped curve
The highest figure (15.2%) occurs among respondents in the lowest income group, followed by the highest group (14.7%) with the lowest in the middle expenditure groups
This phenomenon can also be explained in terms of the source of income of family heads based on type of region (Table 4.2)
Most of the respondents in the lowest expenditure group are employed in agriculture while the highest expenditure group consists largely of people engaged in trade and the middle group of people who work in services, industry and other activities
Land for home-lots and housing is the type most commonly used as collateral
This is explained by the fact that many respondents own only the land on which they live and the fact that this type of land usually has a higher value than agricultural land of any kind
It therefore has a greater value when used as collateral
From the above information it can be concluded that the LAP has had a fairly significant effect (12.8%) on the use of certificates as collateral in credit applications
This conclusion fits in with qualitative information from a number of sources, including prominent community figures, village administrative authorities, Land Offices and BRI branches in all study areas
Most stated that since the LAP program was introduced, borrowing from banking institutions by members of the community has increased both in number of borrowers and the size of loans
At village and kelurahan level evidence of this increase is apparent in the rise in the number of letters of recommendation prepared for prospective borrowers by the lurah, 
while in Land Offices it can be seen from the rise in requests for hak tanggungan
The survey found only eight cases in LAP areas and one case in control areas of respondents who had requested formal use of hak tanggungan for their loans after the LAP
Of these cases 60% involved the use of a LAP certificate
In all BRI branches that were visited there has been an increase in number of loans and borrowers since the LAP was carried out
Bank staff said that the LAP has had certain advantages for the bank
The legal basis for lending is stronger if certificates are used as collateral, 
while guarantees, especially for large loans, are safer because they are reported first to the Land Office
At the same time there has been an increase in number of customers and loans and repayments of credit are more reliable because borrowers show greater responsibility in this matter
BRI branch staff said that the bank can in fact accept collateral in the form of deeds of sale and even girik, provided that the person requesting the loan has a viable business
Even so, possession of a land certificate gives people greater confidence in requesting a loan because they feel confident that their application will be accepted by the bank if accompanied by collateral of this kind
Almost all branches, however, differentiate between certificates and other land documents as collateral by setting different limitations for the size of loans
Variations also exist between different branches of the bank
Meanwhile, staff in four of the 13 BRI branches that were visited during research stated that, since the LAP certification program, they have altered their previous policy and now accept only land certificates as collateral, even though they have not openly announced this change
This policy could explain the decrease in the percentage of loans using land documents other than certificates as collateral in control locations, as shown above
Most of the credit obtained from banks is used for business activities
In LAP areas loans for businesses account for around 84.2% of the total, with 77.5% used for non-agricultural and 6.7% for agricultural purposes
In the control areas, loans for businesses reach 78.6% (53.6% for non-agricultural and 25% for agricultural purposes)
The rest are for consumption purposes, the building or improvement of houses, children's education, and medical expenses
From these facts it can be assumed that LAP certification, by widening opportunities for credit, has had a positive effect on local business activities, and this in turn should have led to improved conditions in the local village economies, specifically for LAP participants
Informal mortgaging (gadai) in both LAP and control locations has been very limited
Among the 1002 respondents in LAP locations only two transactions were recorded in the pre-LAP period and seven after LAP
In the control areas there were four before and two after the LAP
These findings are supported by statements from informants who said that informal mortgaging transactions are rare
The reason lies in the availability of funds on the part of prospective mortgagees, the usefulness of the land offered as a mortgage, and the degree of interest on the part of landowners
Since formal bodies like the government pawnshops do not accept land certificates, transactions are always of an informal nature between a landowner and a member of the community such as a neighbor
The increase from two to seven in informal mortgaging transactions in LAP sites is not traceable to the effect of the LAP, since mortgaging is not linked to a land ownership certificate but is directly connected to the land itself
In mortgaging the owner hands over his land to another person who can then use it in return for a certain sum of money
After the agreed period of time has expired, the landowner repays the loan and receives back his land
If he cannot repay the money, the agreement is extended or else the land is confiscated by the person who borrowed it
Since land that is mortgaged in this way has to be productive, it usually takes the form of cultivable fields or a location for trade or some kind of business
Money obtained by respondents in this way was used as capital for non-agricultural undertakings, house repairs, investment and the education of children
There was also a respondent who mortgaged his certificate to a hospital because he was unable to pay medical bills
4.1.4 Increases in taxes and levies 
The Land and Buildings (PBB) tax 
Some 28.3% of respondents in LAP areas said that there had been a noticeable rise in the PBB after LAP certification, while 22.3% of control respondents said the same thing
The increase of nominal PBB taxes in LAP areas averages 93.5%, while in control areas the percentage increase is smaller (60.3%)
Overall, the net impact of LAP certificates on nominal PBB tax increase was 33.2% (Table 4.4
The highest increase was in urban areas (55.8%) and the lowest in semi-urban locations (13.3%)
Village levies 
Unlike the situation in urban kelurahan, in rural areas there is generally a village charge or levy that is collected by the village office once a year at the time when the PBB tax is collected
This variable could not be analyzed, however, because very little information was obtained during the survey
Only 13 out of 1002 LAP respondents and 8 out of 508 control respondents replied to the question about village levies
All who answered live in rural and semi-urban areas
Discussions with informants showed that a village levy is imposed in only four of the LAP sites and three control sites, all located in Karawang, Bekasi, Karanganyar and Sleman
The amount to be paid is fixed at certain intervals and is based on the size of land parcels
The LAP program had no influence at all on changes in amount
These villages that had no such levy before LAP have continued not to impose one, while in two cases where there had previously been a levy, an increase was made at village level
Increases are due not to the LAP but to a rise in the needs of the village because of inflation
Meanwhile, it would seem that none of the research villages have introduced new levies or charges, since only four respondents out of the total sample said that there had been some kind of new levy
4.2 Differential social impacts 
4.2.1 Gender 
In the context of the gender aspect of land certification, analysis is based on treatment towards men and women during the implementation process and on the names written on certificates in relation to the origin of the land
Treatment towards men and women 
When asked whether women landholders had been treated any differently from men during the LAP process, the majority of respondents (89.7%) said that there had been no discrimination
The fact that invitations to attend socialization meetings were sent to the household head (who in 93.4% of survey cases was a man) is quite normal in Indonesia and in the perception of respondents was in no way discriminatory
Where a woman was the head of a household, however, tended to delegate this task to a son or some other male member of the family
Only 10.5% of women handled the application and supporting documentation for a certificate that was to be issued in their own name
Others asked the husband, a son/son-inlaw or father/father-in-law to act on their behalf
Most women collected completed certificates themselves, however, because the Adjudication Team insisted on the person who had been recorded as owner of the land appearing personally
Names on certificates Conclusions about the effect of the LAP on land ownership by women cannot be based merely on whether there are more men's than women's names on certificates
It is necessary to relate the origin of the land to any changes that have occurred in names before and after certification
Table 4.5 shows that the number of parcels originating directly from the husband's side of the family (both inherited and purchased by the husband before marriage) is 730, by comparison with 294 which were inherited or purchased by the wife before marriage
Thus the ratio is 5:2
It is not surprising therefore that the number of women's names on certificates is far less than the number of men's names
Approximately 26.1% of parcels have been recorded in the name of women, both wives (21.7%) and daughters (4.2%), with a very small percentage in the names of granddaughters and unmarried women (including widows)
Around 66.4% of parcels with a LAP certificate are in the names of men, with 60.6% in husbands names, 4.7% in sons names and 1.1% in the names of other men (sons-in-law, grandsons and unmarried men including widowers)
The proportion of certificates in both the husband's and the wife's names is extremely small
According to BPN officials, the Land Office used the name written on a deed of sale or a sales receipt in preparing the certificates for purchased land
Qualitative information from a number of other persons, including village and RT heads, indicates that the name written on a LAP certificate generally depends on the identity of the owner of the land
If the land is an inheritance or gift from the wife's family, then her name is put on the certificate
The same applies to husbands
This is supported by quantitative data obtained during the survey, which shows that for 697 land parcels originating from the husband's parents, most (74.5%) of the certificates have been issued in his name, with 2.9% in the wife's name, 7% in a son's name and 5.2% in a daughter's name
Where land has come from the wife's parents, 78.2% are in the wife's name, 5.9% have the husband's name, and 4.6 % have a daughter's name and 1.8% have a son's name
Land purchased by the husband before or after marriage is mainly (77.6%) in his name
The same applies to land bought by the wife before and after marriage; 74% has been recorded in her name
Even so, a small proportion of land parcels bought by husband or wife either before or after marriage has been transferred to the spouse (9.8% and 18.5% respectively)
According to data from key informants in the village administrative office in Wiroditan village in Pekalongan District, 335 land parcels were certificated through the LAP and of these 149 certificates (45%) were issued in the names of women
The reason given by informants is that in this area a relatively high proportion of land has passed to women through inheritance or has been given as a gift to daughters by their parents
Land purchased jointly by husband and wife Key informants stated that where land has been bought jointly by a couple after marriage, it was generally registered in the LAP certification program in the husband's name because he is the head of the household
Among respondents there are a few cases where land bought after marriage was registered in the name of the wife (16.9%) or in both names (3%) but in most cases (70.9%) it is in the husband's name
Survey data reveal that where land purchased jointly after marriage has been put in the husband's name, it was because the couple together decided to do so
The tendency for land purchased jointly after marriage to be recorded in the husband's name is greater in urban areas than in rural areas (Table 4.6)
In urban areas 76.9% has been registered in the husband's name and 14.3% in the wife's name
In rural areas land bought jointly is in the wife's name in 20.4% of cases and in the husband's in 66.7% of cases
In semi-urban areas the proportions are 17.4% in the wife's name and 67.4% in the husband's name
Overall, respondents said that the reason for the name on the certificate depended on inheritance (51.9%) or on a joint decision by husband and wife (38.3%)
A small group said that the reason was that the original name had not been altered (4.9%) while others said the decision was based on the advice of parents so that the land could easily be passed on to the next generation and could not be sold to others
Qualitative information revealed exceptions in a number of areas, however
In Jagakarsa, in cases where the husband was deceased, the certificate shows the name of the eldest son
In Saga there were cases of land given by the respondent's parents-in-law being registered in the names of husbands as head of the household
The wives had no objection because they believed that the land in question belonged to the household
4.2.2 Distinctions between rich and poor 
In attempting to identify any distinctions between rich and poor in the granting of LAP land certificates, the survey collected data for monthly household expenditure as a proxy for economic status
Data are expressed in quintiles in proportion to the number of certificates issued through the LAP
Quintile 1 consists of households with the lowest expenditure, Quintile 3 those with medium expenditure, and Quintile 5 those with the highest relative expenditure
Table 4.7 shows that the average proportion of land parcels certificated through the LAP is greater than 90% for all quintiles
This proportion increases somewhat from Quintile 1 to 3 and then decreases
This indicates that systematic land registration touched all socioeconomic groups within the community, with the greatest percentage in the middle group
This table also shows that the average number of parcels from the total owned by respondents increases with quintiles (from 1 to 5), 
but if the size is considered the pattern is different and does not quite reflect rich and poor
It is not always those in the wealthiest group who have the largest parcels of land
For example, respondents in Quintile 2 own parcels averaging 591 sq.` meters, whereas those in Quintile 4 have an average parcel of 509 sq meters
The same pattern appears in the average number of certificated parcels owned by respondents, that is, the number increases with wealth from Quintile 1 to 5, except in the case of Quintile 4 which is smaller than Quintile 3
Once again, it is not always the wealthy who have the largest areas of land
The average size among the Quintile 5 group is smaller than the size owned by Quintile 2 respondents and on average sizes owned by Quintile 4 people are smaller than those owned by the Quintile 1 group
4.2.3 Participation of ethnic groups 
Information from key informants indicated that there are Indonesian citizens of Chinese ethnic origin in survey areas in Karawang, Bekasi, Depok, Palembang and Medan 
they had been obliged to meet one further requirement in the form of proof of citizenship (SBKRI) when submitting LAP applications
As it happened, there were very few respondents of Chinese origin in survey locations
Of the 899 respondents who answered the question about ethnic discrimination, 50.7% said that they did not know if it had occurred, while 47.6% said that there had been no discrimination of any kind
Only 1.7% stated that they felt that there had been discrimination
V WIDER SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE LAP 
5.1 Investments in land 
Investments in land in this context are considered to be changes made in the condition of a parcel of land in such a way that benefits or services from that land will increase
One benefit gained from the LAP is that landholders now have legal proof of ownership and this in turn creates a sense of security in using the land for any purpose
People feel that they can make improvements to their land or to their houses without fear of disturbances or claims by other people
While it is recognized that other factors, in particular the availability of money, influence the extent to which land and buildings are improved, this analysis focuses specifically on the effect of LAP certificates on the extent of investments
The analysis will differentiate by type of region (urban, semi-urban and rural), per capita expenditure of the certificate holder's household (based on five quintiles in which Q1 has the lowest expenditure) and the form of land use (home-lot, agricultural land and other uses)
5.1.1 Land improvements 
In both LAP and control areas, irrespective of type of region, land improvements have been made
The proportion in the control group, however, is lower than in LAP areas (Table 5.1)
If all regions are considered, the difference between the two (5.3%) is the net effect of LAP certification
The highest figure occurs in rural areas (12.3%), while in urban and semi-urban areas comparable figures are 3.5% and 3.4% respectively
The extent of improvements increases with monthly expenditure quintiles among both LAP participants and the control group (Table 5.2)
The net effect of LAP on land improvements has been inverse U-shaped, with the greatest effect was for households in the middle quintile
For respondents in the lowest expenditure quintile, the effect of a LAP certificate has been negative, although small
The type of land that has most commonly been improved is land used for houses (that is, home-lots)
Among LAP participants the proportion of improved home-lots is 23.9%, while in the case of irrigated rice-land the figure is 17.6% and for other agricultural land it is 5.9%
In control group locations, most of the improvements (20%) that occurred involved agricultural land other than irrigated rice-fields
Land for housing is 18.1% and for rice cultivation 13.6%
5.1.2 Improvements to housing 
Table 5.3 shows that in both LAP and control areas more than 75% of the cases of improvements to housing consisted of the building or repair of houses
In some cases they involved the addition of rooms or improvements in flooring, while in other cases they consisted of the construction or improvement of fencing
5.1.3 Improvements to agricultural land 
Some 34 parcels of irrigated rice-fields were certificated through the LAP; of these 17.6 % underwent a change in land use while in control areas the figure was 13.6% of 22 parcels
The overall impact was thus 4%
Improvements to rice-fields included the repair of irrigation channels in two cases
In the control areas changes were made to three out of 22 parcels; in two cases the change involved construction of a house
5.2 Changes in land markets 
5.2.1 Impact on the perceived value of land 
It proved difficult to obtain information about the value of land, especially when respondents were asked specifically about periods before and after LAP implementation
Many respondents had never known, and others could not remember, what their land had been worth a few years ago
Only those who have sold or mortgaged land or plan to do so had any real knowledge of trends in land prices
For this reason the prices mentioned in this section may not be the actual market values that prevailed but simply the perceptions of respondents
The difficulty of obtaining information can be seen from the fact that only 634 respondents (63.3%) in LAP areas and 216 (42.5%) in control locations gave answers to questions about land values (Table 5.4)
In the following analysis of the effect of land certification on land values, a comparison is made of the average increase in land prices in LAP and control areas
Overall, the increase in the former areas has been 203.4% and in the latter 138.9%
The difference between the two, that is, around 65%, is considered as the impact of LAP certificates on average land prices
The greatest rise within LAP areas occurred in urban regions (228.6%), while in control areas it took place in semi-urban areas (149.1%)
The greatest net impact of LAP was felt in urban areas (a little over 133%), compare to 64.6% in rural areas and 32.8% in semi-urban areas
This means that urban land with a certificate experienced far higher increase in value relative to urban land without a certificate
This is understandable since on the whole people in towns and cities give more attention to the status of land because they are more aware of legal matters; 
furthermore, land parcels are so small that boundaries between them must be clear and at the same time there is more likelihood of land issues arising
Interviews with key informants at community, village and sub-district levels revealed the same situation, namely, that there has been a tendency for land values to rise since the LAP, except in Bekasi
Not all informants, however, are convinced that the increase is due solely to the LAP, since factors like inflation, regional development and greater population pressure also exert an influence
In the Bekasi survey sites land values have gone down, not because of the LAP, but because of the economic crisis that occurred at the same time as LAP implementation
The crisis led to a drop in the number of Jakarta people interested in buying land
5.2.2 Sale and purchase of land 
The impact of systematic land titling through the LAP on land markets can be seen from Tables 5.5 to 5.9
Data reveal that the LAP has had a net effect of 1.7% increase on the extent of land transactions in the survey locations (Table 5.5)
The frequency of land transactions has been greatest in semi-urban areas in both LAP (5%) and control areas (3.2%), while the frequency of sales has been lowest in urban areas
Even so, in rural areas there has been a large difference between LAP locations and control areas
The differences, which have been as great as four times, indicate that the existence of a certificate is more significant in rural than in other regions
Even so, the differences across regions are not very great
Analysis by per capita expenditure quintiles (Table 5.6) shows that in LAP locations it is mainly respondents in Quintiles 2 and 3 who have sold land, while in control areas most sales have been made by respondents in Quintiles 4 and 5
The greatest overall effect of the LAP on land sales by LAP participants has occurred in Quintiles 2 and 3 (6.1% and 5.0% respectively), while the effects for the lowest and highest quintiles had been found to be negative
The type of land sold (Table 5.7) for home-lots in LAP areas was 3.4, while in control areas was 1.3%
The effect of LAP certification on the frequency of sale of home-lots is the difference between the two, that is, 2.1%
The effect on the sale of non-irrigated land has been around 1.8%, while the impact of the LAP on rice-fields has been negative (-3.2%)
5.2.3 Interest in buying and selling land 
Table 5.8 indicates the extent to which potential buyers have shown an interest in the land of respondents in LAP and control locations
It appears that the land most attractive to buyers in both LAP and control areas is urban land, followed by semi-urban land
Rural land is less attractive in both LAP and control areas
In LAP areas interest has been expressed in 11.5% of the 992 land parcels for which survey respondents gave information, while in control locations the figure is 9.0%
This indicates that purchasers prefer certificated parcels and that the LAP has had an impact of 2.5% on the interest of those purchasers
From the point of view of type of region, the impact of the LAP on purchasers interest has been positive in urban and rural areas, yet in semi-urban areas there has been no apparent impact
The place of residence or domicile of those interested in buying land varies from the immediate vicinity of the land and other villages or kelurahan to towns and cities (urban regions) but the proportions are approximately equal
A similar trend was found among respondents when they were asked whether they wish to sell their land
As Table 5.9 shows, interest in selling is highest in urban and semi-urban areas and lowest in rural areas
Overall, the interest in selling land in LAP areas was 5.7%, while in control areas was 4.2%
The impact of the LAP is indicated by the difference of 1.4% in the proportion in LAP and control areas
The greatest impact is found in rural areas (3.3%), followed by semi-urban (1.1%) and urban areas (0.5%)
Although LAP implementation has had some impact on the wish of respondents to sell certificated land, they will do so only after considering a number of aspects, especially the economic aspect
The reasons given by those who said that they would like to sell land include a desire to move to another place, the wish to obtain business capital, plans to buy land elsewhere and the need for money to build a house
Similarly, the reasons for sale given by those who have already sold land are not of a consumptive nature
Rather, they said that they needed a large sum of money for the education of children, business capital or the purchase of land in another place
5.2.4 Impact on nearby areas 
It has been estimated that certification of land in a number of kelurahan and villages has also had an effect on land markets in the general vicinity
In the perception of just under 30% of LAP participants, land titling has indeed had an impact on land values in the vicinity of LAP implementation areas (Table 5.10)
Just over 40%, however, felt that there has been no such effect, while another 30% said that they had no idea whether or not there has been an impact
The 70% of respondents in the last two categories stated that many other factors apart from the existence of LAP certificates have influenced land values
Respondents living in areas where the LAP was not implemented very much hope that their villages and kelurahan will be included in the next round of LAP certification
While not everyone understands how cheap and easy the LAP process is, all hope that there will be some kind of large-scale registration program that will provide certificates for their land
5.2.5 Other impacts 
Two additional impacts of the LAP were mentioned by key informants at RT/RW, village and sub-district level
The first impact is the establishment of new offices by notaries in those sub-districts where LAP land titling has taken place
Five offices have been opened in Tangerang, one in Bekasi and one in Sleman, which indicates that there is now more demand among the community for notarial services
The second impact is the decline that has occurred in village and sub-district revenue in places where the LAP has been carried out
The establishment of new offices by notaries has made it easy for landholders to have deeds of sale drawn up
Thus land transactions are being increasingly handled by notaries rather that by village and sub-district heads (camat)
Actually it is still possible to obtain a land certificate through the camat, who is himself a PPAT (Pejabat Pembuat Akta Tanah or official with authority to prepare land deeds), but people prefer a notary, as they say that the fee is lower
The cost through a notary is between 1.0% and 1.5% of the sales value (NJOP), while the cost through the camat ranges from 5% to 15%, depending on negotiations and the size of the NJOP, which becomes lower as the land becomes more expensive
This means a drop in revenue for village and sub-district administrative authorities
The effect is felt most strongly in those villages that have no other sources of local revenue apart from charges for land transactions
5.3 Encouragement of sporadic titling 
Sporadic titling is land registration done at the request of the landholder, which usually means the owner or the buyer of a land parcel
Titling of this kind is done in the case of first time registration or because of changes in physical or legal data about a land parcel that has already been registered
It also takes in the replacement of lost or damaged certificates
One effect of the LAP on nearby villages and kelurahan has been increased awareness of the benefits of certification
The cost of sporadic registration, defined in this survey as first-time registration of land at the initiative of the individual landholder, is determined by the district-level Land Office for each area in the district or city
The largest component in pricing is land surveying, the cost of which has always been high
A survey respondent in Gresik, for example, said that the official cost of surveying land parcels less than one hectare in size ranges from Rp103,000 to Rp951,000 while for 10 hectares the figure is Rp7.35 million
In fact, however, the total cost is far greater
For that reason many communities are attempting to establish a swadaya (self-help) system of land titling that would be somewhat more expensive than the LAP, yet much cheaper than sporadic registration
Their plans are based on achieving economies of scale by having a large number of adjacent parcels surveyed at the same time and applications handled collectively
In many places close to LAP areas, however, the opposite has happened
People are waiting for the next round in the LAP and sporadic registration has actually declined
Hence the effect of the LAP on encouragement of sporadic land titling seems to have been mixed
Some 94% of respondents said that the cost of LAP certification had imposed very little financial burden on their household because the program had been very cheap
The majority (78.9%) of respondents feel that, if the cost of the certificate has to be raised, it should be no more than Rp50,000, or Rp90,000 if other charges are included (Table 5.11)
These amounts are substantially lower than the amounts people are actually willing to pay through a swadaya system
For example, in Ciganjur kelurahan (South Jakarta) the community is in the process of making a request to the BPN to undertake swadaya certification; people are prepared to pay Rp350,000 per parcel, which is the amount paid in other places where swadaya certification has already taken place
The same was found in Bandung
Meanwhile, in Baturaden (Central Java) respondents are making plans for swadaya certification at a cost of Rp150,000 per parcel
At the same time many control group respondents feel that the cost of a certificate should be related to the size of the parcel of land
In Ciganjur, for example, some suggest the application of several layers or strata in charges that would reflect the location of the land, proximity to transport and the other factors mentioned above
They propose seven strata with a difference of Rp50,000 to Rp100,000 between each
Classification is not yet final, however, as there have to be further discussions among the community
With the introduction of a progressive scale of charges, the planned system of adjudication would more closely resemble sporadic than systematic registration of the type on which the LAP was based
While recognizing the fact that there is great community interest in large-scale swadaya registration of land, BPN officials have said that swadaya adjudication cannot be undertaken because there are as yet no regulations that would provide a legal basis for land certification of this kind
At the present time proposed regulations are being discussed for submission to the Department of Finance
VI CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY DEVELOPMENT 
If the LAP is to be continued in its present form, a number of implications from the findings of this study warrant consideration
Implications based on survey data
1 Priority in targeting should continue to be given to landholders in the lower socioeconomic strata in all regions
The subsidy provided by the LAP to cover part of certification costs is difficult to justify if the benefits of LAP titling are to be shared by landholders in the higher socio-economic strata
There is, however, an urgent need to make sporadic titling as easy and as fast as LAP titling
2 Policies concerning the cost of certificates should be reconsidered and should take into account
- the fact that many people in urban and some semi-urban areas can afford, and are willing, to pay more than at present for land certification through the LAP, provided that the process remains easy and quick and costs do not begin to approximate those of sporadic land registration
- the size of individual land parcels and the use to which the land is put, even though this would necessitate the development of a more sophisticated scale of costs than the current one, which differentiates only between urban and rural locations
- possibilities for swadaya (self-help) land registration on a local basis, without any attempt to make uniform regulations for all regions
3 Within the LAP implementation process there is scope for improvement in certain aspects
- Socialization activities must provide complete information and transparency about all aspects of land titling and in particular the cost of the certificate itself and other associated charges imposed at village level
- Socialization must be conducted in a planned manner and in all relevant places, including those that are relatively remote from the village administrative office
- Physical and legal information about land parcels for which certification applications have been made should be disseminated widely at all levels at least one month before certificates are issued, as stipulated in BPN guidelines, and should not be limited to a printed notice placed in the village office
- There should be greater precision in the surveying of land to reduce complaints about errors on certificates
- After the completion of LAP certification in each area, data about land ownership should be forwarded to appropriate government agencies, including taxation offices as well as district, sub-district and village administrative offices, in the interests of greater efficiency and order in land administration; at the same time the public should be given easy access to this information
4 The National Land Agency and its regional Land Offices should work more closely with government agencies responsible for land-related matters, for example, the Land and Buildings Tax (PBB) agency
Close cooperation would offer certain advantages in 
- updating of records on the part of the PBB agency so as to adjust figures to the size of parcels shown on land certificates; this would increase community confidence in both the taxation and the agrarian agencies
- the development of a common recording system; this would provide the basis for the BPN to develop a new land certificate pricing system that includes other variables, since the PBB agency already operates on the principles of land use and location
5 Consideration should be given to providing payment for RT heads in recognition of their very significant role in LAP implementation
These unpaid village officials are not members of the Adjudication Team, yet they handle the greater part of the socialization and administrative work connected with the LAP at community level
General observations resulting from the survey
6 The LAP program cannot be applied in a uniform fashion in all regions, particularly those outside Java, due to significant differences in the systems of land rights that prevail in those regions
7 The LAP in its present form cannot be expected to form an instrument by which specific land problems can be solved
This applies to land considered to be state-owned (tanah negara) and also to land where certain non-typical traditional rights still exist, as in Medan where certain rights can be traced back to the former Grand Sultan
8 If the LAP is to make an even greater contribution in providing security of tenure to landholders, ways should be found to provide certificates for land parcels located in areas classed as state-owned; if ownership rights cannot be given, at least usage rights should be granted to those who have lived there for a certain number of years
Adoption of such a policy would require unqualified support from other government agencies
ANNEX 
1.3 Site descriptions 
1 South Jakarta City (urban) 
A Jagakarsa kelurahan, Jagakarsa Sub-district 
Jagakarsa Sub-district is located within South Jakarta, which has the administrative status of a city (kota)
Most of the kelurahan in which the LAP was undertaken are located on the periphery of the sub-district
The kelurahan of Jagakarsa, which is the administrative center of the sub-district of the same name, is located at a distance of 12 km from the South Jakarta Administration Office
It is the most urban of the kelurahan and the one with the highest level of LAP certification
In the year 2001 the population of the kelurahan was 34,793 persons and population density was 7,174 persons per sqkm
Almost half of the 485 ha covered by Jagakarsa was until recently used for fish-ponds (empang)
Now some of that land has become home-lots on which houses have been built
Despite the presence of fish-ponds, a large proportion of the residents earn a living as public servants or as office and factory employees
Prior to the LAP, most land documents were traditional papers (girik), deeds of sale (surat akta jual beli) or nothing more that informal sales receipts
At that time less than 30 % of land parcels in the kelurahan had certificates
In the case of inherited land, much was still in the names of parents and had been subdivided among heirs without a will
Where there was a will, it was a document of weak legal status
In 1995 registration of around 10% of uncertificated land parcels was undertaken through the Pronada (Prona Daerah) program
In 1996-97 the kelurahan was chosen as a demonstration area for land certification financed by the government of Jakarta (DKI)
Finally, the LAP was introduced and a large number of certificates was issued through this program
It has been estimated that almost 100 % of land parcels in Jagakarsa kelurahan now have certificates
B Ciganjur kelurahan, Jagakarsa Sub-district 
Ciganjur kelurahan, which was selected as the control site for research in Jagakarsa, is located a little to the south of Jagakarsa
On the western side Ciganjur adjoins the city of Depok
It covers 338 ha, of which 30% is used for houses and home-lots, 31% for fish-ponds and 14% for dry fields and other farm land
There are also a number of pesantren in the area, which is a basis of the NU organization
The population in 2001 was 20,784 and density was 6,150 persons to the sqkm for the whole kelurahan
Since there is still a relatively large amount of agricultural land in this area, many residents earn their livelihood as farmers or agricultural workers
The latter account for 51% of the population, while another 19% are self-employed in small business and 16% are office and factory workers
The rest are public servants, members of the army, pensioners, carpenters and other tradesmen or else earn a living in the services sector
Ciganjur kelurahan has never been selected for any government land certification program, by contrast with Jagakarsa, which has participated three times in registration programs
It has been overlooked not only in the LAP but in other government programs also, 
a fact that has continued to disappoint many of its residents
Existing data indicate that certificates have been issued for only 23 of the 4,244 land parcels recorded as being subject to the annual Land and Buildings Tax (PBB)
2 Tangerang District (semi-urban) 
A Saga village, Balaraja 
Sub-district The village of Saga is located approximately 20 km from the district capital of Tangerang and only 2 km from the Balaraja entry point to the Jakarta-Merak toll road
It covers 477 ha, of which 83% consists of rice-fields and unirrigated agricultural land
There are, however, several housing complexes
The village has 13,962 people, with a population density of 2,870 per sq.km of all land
The population consists of both newcomers and indigenous people
The majority of the newcomers, who for the most part live in the housing complexes, work in factories situated around the town of Balaraja
The greater proportion of the indigenous residents earn a livelihood in agriculture as farmers, sharecroppers and laborers, while some are employed in trade and factory work
At the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, when there was considerable alienation of land in this village by housing developers, many farmers lost their rights to the land that they were cultivating
Today the land market in Saga is still high, a fact that reflects the strategic location of the village
Access to the toll road is easy and the village itself is surrounded by a number of large factories
Currently there are plans to build a very large housing complex in and adjacent to Saga, as well as a bus and minibus terminal and a market
In 1986 land certification had commenced through the PRONA program but only 25 land parcels all of them owned by prominent community figures - received certificates
Implementation of the LAP took place in Saga in 1997-98 and in 1998-99, with priority given to the titling of home-lots and built-up areas
Before the LAP was undertaken, less than 5% of land parcels outside the housing complexes had certificates, but today approximately 85% of non-irrigated land has been registered
B Tobat village, Balaraja 
Sub-district The village of Tobat, selected for control purposes, is also in Balaraja Sub-district and is located to the south of Saga
Although it has a number of factories, there are no housing complexes
More than 50% of the village area of 555 ha consists of rice-fields
This explains why most households, like many in Saga, still depend on the agricultural sector for a living as farmers or agricultural laborers
Others earn a livelihood as employees in private companies
Meanwhile, the factories established in Tobat in recent years seem to have an existence that is quite distinct from community life, since very few of the local people have obtained the chance to work in one of the companies or factories in the village
The reason is the constraints imposed by low levels of education within the Tobat community
The territory covered by Tobat village is somewhat elongated in shape, with the result that there are a number of RWs (known locally as jaro) that are located at some considerable distance from the village office
The residents of these RWs feel that because of their geographical location they receive very little attention from the village head
There have been many disputes involving land in this village, especially in the context of the alienation of land for factory construction
With the exception of land that has been purchased by businessmen, most land parcels in Tobat have no certificates
Local people regard this situation as an invitation to disputes in coming years and for that reason they feel that they very much need a land titling program like LAP
3 Bekasi District (semi-urban) 
A Burangkeng village, Setu 
Sub-district Burangkeng village is located on the main highway that links Bekasi and Bogor Districts, at a distance of 27 km from the city of Bekasi and less than 2 km from the administrative center of Setu Sub-district
Public transport to either of these places is readily available in the form of minibuses at any time
In the year 2000 Burangkeng had a population of 7,936 persons or 1,812 households
The village covers 287 ha and most of its people are employed in agriculture in the form of either rice cultivation or fruit growing
Others obtain a living from trade or from small household businesses
The greater part of the land in Burangkeng (224 ha) consists of rain-fed rice-fields, but some is planted with fruit trees, of which rambutan is the most common
In general, people do not live in large groups along the main road but instead are widely scattered in small hamlets located some distance inland from the road
The settlement pattern is closely related to the nature of the land, most of which cannot be irrigated
For some time the land in this village has been under observation by capitalists, who see it as a potential industrial site
Their hopes have so far been blocked, however, by the existence of a district policy that has designated Setu Sub-district as a residential area
Before the economic crisis, people living in Jakarta showed a lot of interest in land in and around Burangkeng because, with steady expansion in the city of Bekasi itself, housing complexes and factories had been constructed in a zone not far from Burangkeng
It is said that around 40 ha in Burangkeng is controlled by people living in Jakarta
Since the crisis, however, right at the time when the LAP was undertaken in this village, interest on the part of Jakarta residents in purchasing land here has declined, to the point where the price of land in the village has dropped by 50%
In the 1983-85 period the PRONA land registration program was carried out in Burangkeng, and then in 1996-97 LAP was implemented
This resulted in the titling of 3,508 land parcels, of which all but 3,350 received certificates of ownership
The remaining 8 parcels received usage rights
B Mekarwangi village, Cibitung 
Sub-district The village of Mekarwangi is located on the main Setu highway and belongs to Cibitung Subdistrict, which adjoins Setu
It is around 9 km from the sub-district center, and 18 km or 45 minutes from the district capital of Bekasi
Like Burangkeng, it can be described as semi-urban in nature
Mekarwangi covers an area of 602 ha, much of which is occupied by an industrial estate known as MM2100
Only 10 ha of rice-fields now remain
Even so, despite the fact that the village is in an industrial zone, its human settlements still have strong rural features
There is some distance between houses, which are still relatively simple in nature, especially those along the main road
This appears to be due to the effect of the location of the industrial zone in the back part of the village and not on the highway
A high fence separates the industrial zone from local settlements and there is direct access to and from the zone from the Cikampek toll road rather than through Mekarwangi village
In the year 2000 Mekarwangi had a population of 55,745 or 1,370 households
On the whole residents are employed in trade, as service providers (drivers of vehicles and ojek), as factory workers in the industrial zone (especially those who are relatively young) and as farmers
A number of local people have constructed rooms, which they rent out to factory workers who live elsewhere
The main agricultural activity is the cultivation of fruit both in the area that remains in the village itself and also outside the village and even outside the sub-district
Those people who were evicted from their land by the establishment of the industrial zone have generally purchased agricultural land outside the village
4 Karawang District (rural) 
A Margasari village, Klari Sub-district 
The village of Margasari is located 14 km from the small town of Klari, which is the capital of the sub-district
Unlike other villages in Klari Sub-district, Margasari is not situated on the coastal highway that links Karawang with Indramayu
Rather, it is some distance away from the main road and can only be reached by a narrow village road
Public transport goes only as far as a hamlet 2 km from the village, after which it is necessary to walk or travel by ojek (a motor-cycle that carries a passenger) for another 2 km
In 2001 the population of Margasari was 7,498 persons (1,933 households)
Only 4% of the adult population are land-owning farmers
Some 38% are agricultural laborers, 20% are employed in the services sector (mainly as pedicab drivers), 17% work in offices or factories and 14% are engaged in trade or some other kind of small business
The rest are public servants, members of the armed forces, pensioners and artisans
Margasari is located in a rice-growing area
Approximately 71% of its total area of 283 ha consists of rice-fields with technical irrigation; the remaining 29% is used for houses and other buildings
Houses are situated along the village road, while rice-fields are located both along this road and behind the built-up area
The greater part of these rice-fields does not belong to village residents
Rather, it is the property of people who live in Karawang, the district capital
Sale of rice-fields took place on a large scale in the early 1990s when there was high demand from urban people
This demand stemmed from plans for the construction of a road leading to the coastal highway
Although the proposed road was to transverse village rice-fields, the village people themselves had heard nothing about it at the time
Most of the land in Margasari, both home-lots and rice-fields, has already been titled
At present, more than 91% of the 2,639 land parcels in the village have certificates
Of these parcels 75 received certificates through Prona in 1995, while another 2,335 parcels were certificated through the LAP in 1996-97 (home-lots) and 1997-98 (rice-fields)
B Darawolong village, Klari 
Sub-district Darawolong, the control village for this area, is located at the eastern end of Klari Sub-district
It is 6 km from the town of Klari and 17 km from Karawang
To reach the village it is necessary to go through Cikampek Sub-district and then along a village road that can be used only by ojek
Darawolong covers 603.7 ha, of which 520 ha is rice-fields (427 ha with irrigation and 93 ha without)
The 83.7 ha of non-irrigated land is used for home-lots and other buildings
In 2001 the population was 5,748 (1,772 households)
The majority of people earn their livelihood from ricecultivation
Of the 632 persons engaged in agriculture, 347 are farmers who own the land they cultivate, 55 persons are sharecroppers and 230 are agricultural laborers
The rest earn a living as the owners of or unskilled laborers in small businesses, factory workers, public servants and pensioners and in trade
Darawolong is one of the three villages in Klari Sub-district that have not yet participated in the LAP
It had been included in the 2000-01 target for Karawang District and socialization of the program had begun
But in that year Karawang itself was not included in the national-level plans for the LAP
Interest in land titling among village officials and the community was so great, however, that BPN tried unsuccessfully to have certification carried out with funding from the Karawang District budget
Some individuals, who said that they were from a certain Foundation (yayasan), then offered to arrange for certificates to be issued at around Rp.300,000 per parcel
Several people had their land measured and some even paid
Later it was discovered that the materai (duty stamps) that had been sold to RT heads for applications were counterfeit, by which time the individuals concerned had disappeared
5 Depok City (semi-urban) 
A Sukamaju kelurahan, Sukmajaya 
Sub-district The kelurahan of Sukamaju is located on the Jakarta-Bogor Highway approximately 10 km from the center of Depok City
It has easy access to both cities by road, by electric train and by the Jagorawi toll road
Its strategic location and excellent road connections have long attracted land developers to Sukamaju
There are now ten housing complexes, which cover around 75% of the built-up part of Sukamaju
There are also several large pharmaceutical companies as well as food and beverage processing factories and a tire vulcanization business
Around 90% of Sukamaju's 388 ha is used for housing
Rice-fields, unirrigated fields and fish-ponds constitute no more than 5%
In 2000 Sukamaju had almost 35,000 residents and a density of 8,950 persons or 2,200 households to the sqkm
Many of the people living here are newcomers, as the presence of the housing complexes indicates
The homes of the original Betawi people have been pushed to the outskirts of Sukamaju or else are situated in densely populated kampongs behind the housing complexes
In addition to local people and newcomers, there are also a number of residents of Chinese ethnic origin
Most of the people of Sukamaju depend on the industrial and services sectors for their livelihood
Those who live in the housing complexes are generally employed in Jakarta in private businesses or state-owned companies (BUMN) or as public servants
By contrast, most of the people who live in the kampongs work as unskilled laborers, bricklayers, small-scale vendors in food stalls, itinerant sellers and taxi and ojek drivers
Those newcomers who reside in the kampongs are usually employed as unskilled laborers and daily wage workers in the large, medium and small businesses and factories located along the highway
The LAP was carried out in Sukamaju between 1997 and 1999
Almost all land parcels on which houses have been built in the kampongs now have certificates
In 2001 land without certificates amounted to 30 parcels (3 ha), most of them owned by people living elsewhere
B Jatijajar kelurahan, Cimanggis 
Sub-district Jatijajar kelurahan is located on the Jakarta-Bogor highway directly opposite Sukamaju but in a different sub-district
Within the kelurahan there are two large factories, namely, a spinning mill and a paint company, as well as a medium-sized soft drink factory
Like other areas close to Depok, Cimanggis Sub-district has been a target among developers seeking locations for housing complexes
In 1991-2 land acquisition began for construction of the Jatijajar Housing Estate on an area of 60 ha, that is, around 23% of kelurahan land (258.37 ha)
The land alienated so far, however, amounts to only 40 ha
Approximately 78% of Jatijajar kelurahan consist of kampongs, the Jatijajar Housing Estate and an army housing complex, while 19% is made up of rice-fields, dry fields, fish-ponds and a small lake
In the year 2000 the population of the kelurahan was 19,344, with a density of 77,470 persons or 1,475 households to the sq.km
Ojek represent the only means of public transport for those wishing to get to the highway
The kampongs located along this highway have semi-urban characteristics, which become increasingly rural with distance from the road
As in other places the residents of the housing estate are newcomers who generally work in offices in Jakarta
Most of the people of local origin are employed as factory workers, bricklayers and carpenters, agricultural laborers and sharecroppers, food vendors and ojek drivers
No more than 70 persons living in Jatijajar kelurahan but outside housing complexes have land certificates; 
the greater majority do not
With the exception of those who have a friend or relative in a kelurahan where the LAP was implemented, most of the Jatijajar community know nothing at all about the land titling project
6 Bandung City (urban) 
A Babakan Sari kelurahan, Kiara Condong 
Sub-district Babakan Sari covers an area of 88.1 ha, of which almost 80% is used for houses and public facilities like shopping centers, supermarkets, traditional markets, schools, offices and places of worship
The kelurahan is bounded on one side by the Bandung-Yogyakarta railway line and on the others by roads that carry busy traffic at all times
The Kiara Condong Sub-district office, the community health center and an army office are all located in Babakan Sari
Babakan Sari once consisted of irrigated rice-land but, with the expansion that has occurred in the city of Bandung since the late 1970s, residential areas have replaced fields
In December 2001 the population of the kelurahan was 29,036 persons or 6,803 households; 
thus population density is 33,000 persons or more than 7,700 households to the sq.km
There are no open spaces in the area, Even state-owned land along the railway line is used for residential purposes
Houses are very close together and in many cases adjoin one another
Living conditions are so congested that much of the kelurahan can be described as slums
The majority of people living in Babakan Sari are newcomers
In terms of socio-economic position, most belong to the less affluent section of the wider Bandung community
A small proportion are of Chinese ethnic origin
There is a wide variation in sources of livelihood
While some people are employed in the public service or army and in private companies, small businesses and petty trade, others earn a living as skilled laborers (carpenters and the like), as automobile, taxi and ojek drivers and as scavengers
Quite a few are pensioners
The LAP was carried out in Babakan Sari over a two-year period (1997-8 and 1998-9)
Almost all landowners have now received certificates for their land
B Taman Sari kelurahan, Bandung Wetan Sub-district 
Taman Sari kelurahan is situated in the heart of the city of Bandung in the shallow valley of the Cikapundung River
It covers 102 ha and is densely populated with 27,916 residents or 27,370 persons to the sqkm
Approximately 32% of the kelurahan consists of houses
Much of the rest is occupied by large universities like the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) and Universitas Islam Bandung (Unisba)
Slum conditions prevail in most parts, with houses built close together along small paths and lane-ways, most of which are too narrow for anything larger than a motorcycle to enter
The situation is made worse by the river, which is highly polluted and foul-smelling
One reason for the congestion is the fact that many families have added rooms to their houses for leasing to university students
Around such places there are clusters of food stalls (warung), internet cafes and computer rental shops
Most of the people who live in Taman Sari earn a living as public servants, employees in private companies, factory workers and providers of services of various kinds such as food catering
Large numbers are engaged in petty trade of various kinds
Approximately half of the land in this kelurahan is tanah negara (state land) and as such is under the authority of the Bandung city government
The rest is tanah milik adat (land held under traditional law)
State land is located on both banks of the river and along the major roads that form the boundaries of the kelurahan on three sides
Originally the adat land belonged to a handful of people but over time it has been sold or rented out
The majority of Taman Sari residents do not have land certificates
Most landowners have no more than a Deed of Sale (akte jual beli)
Prona was conducted here in 1984 and again in 2000-2001, when RW staff were given priority in registration for the 11 certificates that were issued
This brought total Prona certificates to 354 for an area of three hectares of land
The people of Taman Sari very much hope that the LAP will be carried out in this area as the cost is low and the procedure is easy
7 Sleman District (semi-urban) 
A Sidoluhur village, Godean Sub-district 
The village of Sidoluhur is situated a short distance from Godean Market, half a kilometer from the center of sub-district activities and 15 km from the district capital
It covers 488.6 ha, most of which consists of rice-fields (324.5 ha)
More than half of the rice-land has semi-technical irrigation
In 1999 the population was 2,382 households or just over 10,000
Rice-growing forms the main source of livelihood for the majority of these households
In recent years, however, returns from this form of agriculture have been low because of frequent damage to crops by rats and insect pests
Many local people have therefore turned to other occupations such as construction work and carpentry
Several small furniture factories, food processing units and trading activities have been established, 
in addition to the many businesses that, since the 1950s, have been making roof-tiles for sale as far away as towns outside Java
The people of Sidoluhur are dynamic and keen to progress economically
Most people in the village have completed at least elementary-level schooling; only 12% have less than six years of education
Some time ago the village obtained Rp 3.5 million for road surfacing from a government program; community activities of a self-help (swadaya) nature succeeding in contributing a similar sum
Proximity to Godean Market plays a very important role in the economy of this and other nearby villages since it offers many general facilities including financial services in the form of a branch of the BRI, a government pawnshop and other small financial institutions
Close to the market there are retail shops, restaurants, food-stalls, telephone kiosks, photocopy businesses and vehicle workshops
B Banyuraden village, Gamping Sub-district 
The village of Banyuraden is located about 3 km from the sub-district capital on the local ring road, which makes it a transit area of a peri-urban nature
The dominant form of land use is still agriculture but transfers of land ownership are increasing because of the pressures of urbanization
Employment is also shifting from the agricultural sector to other sectors like industry and services
Even so, rice cultivation is still important, together with the raising of pigs, which is closely associated with local tahu (bean curd) production
Banyuraden had a population of 10,724 people or 2,865 households in the year 2001
The community would very much like the LAP program to be carried out in this village as it was in two other villages in Gamping Sub-district in 1999/2000
It so happens that the National Land College (Sekolah Tinggi Pertanahan Nasional), the Maritime College (Sekolah Tinggi Maritim) and the Health College (Sekolah Tinggi Kesehatan) are all located in this village
In 1998 the village head (lurah), acting in the name of the community, asked the National Land College to act as its intermediary in putting forward a request to BPN for land certification in Banyuraden
College authorities agreed to help and in 2000 community members prepared the documentation required for LAP certification of around 700 land parcels
The College undertook surveying and mapping of the parcels but these documents are still stored in the village office
Landholders had agreed to a charge of Rp 150,000 per certificate but had not yet paid
Even today there has been no follow-up and some documents have been returned to applicants with the statement that they are incomplete
Most people feel very disappointed with the lack of progress on certification
8 Karanganyar District (rural) 
A Gerdu village, Karangpandan Sub-district 
Gerdu is one of the villages included in the poverty alleviation program for backward villages some years ago
The topography of the village is steep and houses are some distance apart because they are situated on hills
The road leading to each hamlet is likewise steep but can be used by vehicles, even though surfacing consists only of stones and earth, supplied by a government project in 1997/98
The same project also enabled clean water to be provided for this village
All landholders have received certificates through the LAP but many are disappointed that holdings proved to be larger than what they actually are because surveyors estimated rather than measured much of the sloping land
Gerdu covers approximately 372.9 ha of land and in 2001 had a population of 2,893 persons or 654 households
Educational levels are less than the last grade of elementary school
Most families earn a living from agriculture, but because of the steep slopes cultivation is difficult
Some of the land is planted with cloves but the trees are not well cared for
Since only one rice harvest can be obtained every year, farmers also plant secondary crops such as cassava and corn
but because of shortages of agricultural water, cropping intensity and output are unsatisfactory
Many men therefore seek jobs as construction workers outside the village, while others raise goats and cattle or trade in livestock
Village activities are well conducted, with various forms of community service that provide continuous care for the village environment
A local arisan (rotating credit group) involves the contribution of building materials rather than money, 
which means that timber, cement and the like are always available for the improvement of individual houses and fences
Although the people themselves live simply and can be described as poor in socio-economic terms, community efforts are reflected in the clean, neat appearance of the village
B Girilayu village, Metesih Sub-district 
Girilayu is located in a fertile agricultural area adjacent to Gerdu village at an altitude of 600 meters
It is approximately 3.5 km from the sub-district capital and 17.5 km from the district capital
The village covers and area of 311.5 ha; of this 63.9 ha consists of rice-fields with semitechnical irrigation and 98.8 ha of non-irrigated land planted with fruit-trees and vegetable crops
Rice-fields can be planted twice a year since there is a good source of water
Cassava, which is harvested twice year, is grown on part of the agricultural land
In 2001 village population was 3,959 and population density was 1,270 persons to the sqkm
Some 90% of the people are employed in agriculture
Young women usually obtain supplementary income as workers in the batik industry while older women weave floor mats from reeds (mendong)
This village is the site of the graves of the kings of Java from the Mangkunegoro line in Solo
The graveyard itself covers 9.2 ha of land and is frequently visited by people, especially Javanese, for spiritual reasons
In addition, there is a stretch of 11 ha of forested land; it functions as a water catchment area and as such is of great benefit to the village environment
The village of Girilayu has never been included in the LAP program
Certificates were provided for 200 land parcels through Prona in 1999/2000 but this represents less than 10% of the total number of parcels in the village
BPN has not selected this village for LAP certification because the people are not considered to be poor socio-economically
9 Semarang City (urban) 
A Purwoyoso kelurahan, Ngaliyan Sub-district 
The kelurahan of Purwoyoso lies within the western part of the city of Semarang, where rapid expansion is taking place
It is located 7 km from the city center and 1 km from the sub-district capital
Covering 135 ha of land, Purwoyoso is situated partly on the lowland plain and partly on a relatively elevated stretch of flat land
In 2001 the population was 14,736 persons, which gives a density of some 10,915 persons to the sqkm
Housing estates cover three hectares of land within the kelurahan
The construction of housing is still taking place here and throughout much of the sub-district of Ngaliyan
At the present time almost 85% of land parcels in Purwoyoso have received a certificate through either Prona or the LAP
The spread of housing complexes in the southern part of Semarang City and the operations of the steel industry and plastic-producing factories in the northern part have had consequences in the form of a shift in sources of livelihood and in residential locations for the people of the city as a whole
A further factor in this shift has been the inability of many of the people living in the coastal parts of the city to compete with newcomers in the management of fish-ponds (tambak)
As a consequence, large numbers of people have moved from the northern part of Semarang to the southern part and have settled in Ngaliyan Sub-district and in Purwoyoso in particular
As far as employment is concerned, there has been a shift from the agricultural sector to the industrial sector and to the services sector
In Purwoyoso, most of the 5,970 people who are employed obtain a living as small businessmen (33%), as public servants and employees in private companies (26%), and as workers in services (17%)
Others work as carpenters, bricklayers and the like, while some are pensioners and a small number are employed as agricultural laborers
B Candi kelurahan, Candi Sari Sub-district 
Candi is one of the kelurahan within the city of Semarang where the LAP land certification has not yet been carried out
The kelurahan is located to the Southeast of the city center
It is 4.2 km from the city and 2.6 km from the sub-district center and is situated on hilly elevated land with small valleys
It covers 68 ha of land and consists of both expensive housing areas and densely populated kampongs
In addition there are shopping and office buildings and a number of public facilities
In 2001 the population of Candi was 11,343 persons or 2,364 households
Population density was thus almost 16,700 persons to the sqkm
The most densely populated parts of the kelurahan are to be found in the valleys between the hills
Transport routes consist of narrow lanes and paths that can be used only by two-wheeled vehicles
The families living in these kampongs are very largely indigenous people whose land has been passed down from one generation to the next
Only a very small number of newcomers own land in these kampongs
Residents tend to belong to the lower socio-economic strata of society
For the greater majority of those who have employment (5,596 persons) the services sector and employment as unskilled laborers provides a livelihood (55%)
Others are employed as small businessmen in the industrial, trade and transportation sectors, while work in the Public Services and many are pensioners
Data obtained from the kelurahan office show that only about 25% of land parcels, covering 17 hectares in Candi, have a certificate
Almost all of the parcels located in the densely populated parts of the kelurahan, including the 8.3 ha of land held by the kelurahan as a source of revenue, have not yet been registered
10 Pekalongan District (semi-urban) 
A Wiroditan village, Bojong Sub-district 
The founders of the batik industry in Pekalongan District were originally batik makers in the village of Wiroditan, which reached the height of its glory as a major center of batik production in the 1966-1975 period
By 1975, however, with the expansion that was taking place in the printed batik industry in Jakarta factories, handmade batik products from Wiroditan could not longer compete
Many small batik businesses became bankrupt and large numbers of Wiroditan residents moved to Jakarta to work in the factories that produced printed batik
Today only around 25% of the people of Wiroditan work as wage laborers in the businesses that still produce handmade batik
The village of Wiroditan is adjacent to the sub-district capital of Bojong
Most of the village, which covers 96.8 ha of land, is low-lying
Of this land 90% (86.3 ha) is not irrigated
The remaining area of 10.5 ha is rice-land, most of which has fully technical irrigation
Most (69%) of the non-irrigated land is used for home-lots and houses, while 28% is used for dry fields and the remaining 3% for public facilities like roads and graveyards
At the end of 2001 the population of Wiroditan was 3,079 persons (725 households)
The village can be described as semi-urban in nature because the majority of its people no longer earn their livelihood from agriculture
Most earn a living from trade and services
There are also a number of people who are employed as industrial and construction workers, public servants and staff in private companies
Only a small proportion are farmers and agricultural laborers
The LAP was conducted in this village in the year 2000, when 335 parcels of land were registered and certificated
This was the remainder of the target by the Adjudication Team for another village
B Bojong Minggir village, Bojong Sub-district 
Bojong Minggir is the administrative capital of Bojong Sub-district and is adjacent to Wiroditan
The LAP land titling program has never been carried out in this village, despite the fact that the Adjudication Team that handled LAP certification in the area rented an office for use as a base camp near the Bojong Minggir village office
Aware of this, local people asked why their village had not been included in the LAP program
The explanation given by the Pekalongan District Land Office, as well as sub-district and village officials, was that in the 1983/84 budget year Bojong Minggir had been included in the Prona land registration program, through which certificates had been issued for approximately 5000 land parcels in the village
Bojong Minggir village covers just on 112 ha of land, almost half of which consists of ricefields
The land used for rice-growing (45.4 ha) has technically controlled irrigation, while only 6 ha is rain-fed
Even so, the agricultural sector is no longer the basis of the local village economy
Some 54.4 ha of the rest of the land in the village is used for home-lots and houses, while dry fields cover another 6 ha
At the end of 2001 the population of the village was 3,312 persons or 785 households
More than half (53%) of these people are employed in the industrial and construction sectors, while 29% earn a living from trade of various kinds
The rest are farmers, agricultural laborers, small-scale business people, public servants, military personnel and pensioners, or else they work in other sectors
Most of the houses in the village are of a permanent nature, which suggests that Bojong Minggir is an economically progressive and prosperous village
11 Gresik District (semi-urban) 
A Mriyunan village, Sidayu Sub-district 
Mriyunan is 0.2 km from the capital of Sidayu Sub-district and 24.2 km from the town of Gresik, which is the capital of Gresik District
It is situated fairly close to the highway that forms an alternative route along the northern coast of East Java from Surabaya through Gresik to Lamongan and Tuban
Aquaculture plays an important role in the economy of Mriyunan
The village covers approximately 152 ha of land, which consists of non-irrigated land and large fish-ponds (tambak), which cover 90% of the area of the village
The remaining 10% of the land is used for home-lots and houses as well as public facilities like a market and a pawnshop
In 2001 the population of the village was 1,956 persons or 410 households
Most of these people are employed in the trade and services sectors of the economy, or else in the aquaculture sub-sector, as might be expected from the spatial extent of fish-ponds within the village
In addition to these sources of livelihood, there are 12 village residents who earn a living from the commercial production of bird's nests
Prior to LAP certification many people used their Petok D documents to obtain credit from the BRI, which has a branch near the sub-district office 0.2 km from the village
B Purwodadi village, Sidayu Sub-district 
The village of Purwodadi is located quite close to Mriyunan; consequently the socio-economic conditions of both villages are almost identical
Purwodadi covers an area of 125.6 ha and is 2 km from the sub-district capital, 36 km from the district capital and 56 km from Surabaya, the provincial capital
Previously, this area was used for rice cultivation and crops were harvested either once or twice a year; however, production costs were high
Since 1980, after numerous migrants from Lamongan had moved to the area because of frequent flooding in their home villages, the rice-fields were gradually replaced by fish-ponds
In one hamlet in Purwodadi there is a small lake called Rambit, which covers one hectare 
This lake is used as a water source to meet the daily household needs of the local people
At the end of 2001, the population of Purwodadi was approximately 1,259 people or 250 households
A large proportion of these people earn a living as fish-pond owners or laborers, farmers, agricultural workers, or stone masons
Other residents have opened shops and food stalls, while many work as public servants or run small-scale businesses
In addition, there are also numerous businesses that produce bird's nests in operation in the village
They are owned both by local residents and by people from outside the area
Besides migrants from Lamongan, there are other residents who have come from various villages in the surrounding region
Most landowners in Purwodadi have land documents in the form of a girik and or just proof of PBB payment (Petok D)
Only 11 parcels of land have land certificates
A land certificate program has never been undertaken in this village in the form of Prona or any other type of mass certification
12 Malang District (rural) 
A Bunut Wetan village, Pakis 
Sub-district The village of Bunut Wetan covers an area of 325 ha and is located 1.5 km from the sub-district capital
Numerous small factories and industries have been established in this village, include businesses producing plasterboard for ceilings, tomato sauce, stoves, cardboard boxess, machineembroidered goods, traditional wooden clogs and house bricks
Bubut Wetan consists of two hamlets, namely, Krajan and Bora Bunut
At present, approximately 80% of the land of the latter is planted with sugar-cane
In 2001, the population of Bunut Wetan was 9,094 people
The majority (around 70%) work as agricultural laborers, construction workers and unskilled laborers in roof-tile and plasterboard factories
Almost 30% of the residents in the village are employed as factory employees at the Sampoerna cigarette factory in Malang, while a few others are land-owning farmers, public servants or members of the Indonesian army
It is estimated that almost 95% of the land in this village has already been certificated, most of it through LAP, by comparison with only 5% before LAP
The land parcels that have not yet been certificated are generally owned by people who live outside of the village
To date, disputes are continuing between the community and the Indonesian Airforce (that is, the Abdul Rahman Saleh Airforce Base) in connection with the management of sugar-cane plantations that have been controlled by the Indonesian Airforce since 1975
Initially, this land was borrowed for a 14-month period from local farmers (through a contract agreement) for the cultivation of cotton and castor-oil
After the period had passed, however, the land was not returned to the community
Instead, part was transferred to the Center for Sugar Research and Development (P3G), and a cotton plantation was established by a company known as PT Kebon Agung
Since this change, it has been revealed that the land was rented to wealthy people from other villages for the cultivation of sugar-cane
The village people want their land back, but so far the dispute has not been resolved, even though the community has carried out demonstrations at the District Office and at the local DPRD building (the district-level People's Assembly)
B Sumber Kradenan village, Pakis Sub-district 
In Sumber Kradenan village, LAP certification has not been implemented because the community has not been particularly interested in becoming involved in the program even though a large number of local land parcels have not yet been certificated
In location Sumber Kradenan village and Bunut Wetan village are separated by Ampeldento village, which has already implemented LAP
Sumber Kradenan is located two kilometers from the sub-district capital and 7.5 kilometers from the district capital
The village covers an area of approximately 363.2 hectares, with a population of 5,381 persons or 1,497 households
The farming sector still provides the backbone of the economy for the majority of community members, who usually work farmers, farm laborers and laborers on plantations or livestock farms
A small number are also employed as state civil servants or white-collar workers in private firms
13 Palembang City (urban) 
A and B 5 Ulu Kelurahan, Seberang Ulu I Sub-district 
Both survey beneficiaries and the control group were selected from within the 5 Ulu kelurahan, since LAP certification in South Sumatra was focused here
This kelurahan is approximately one kilometer from the center of the sub-district and three kilometers from Palembang, the capital of the province
The kelurahan is located on the bank of the Musi River and is crossed by three of the Musi's tributaries
Because of swamps and the tidal effect in the Musi itself, some 50 percent of the 284 hectares of land within the kelurahan is affected by the movement of river water
The kelurahan can be reached from the city of Palembang in two ways
The first is by taking a public transport vehicle (with two or four wheels) that crosses the Ampera Bridge and goes along the main road
The second way involves travelling along the river in a getek (a boat with an inboard motor)
Road transport operates throughout most of the day, which makes it easy for local residents to reach places outside their kelurahan
Many households, however, have no choice in their means of transport for, in the absence of roads suitable for vehicles or motor-cycles, 
several parts of the kelurahan can be reached only by getek
Most of the residents of 5 Ulu kelurahan are newcomers
The original people of the area are today in the minority
The two groups, however, are really one community since the newcomers have been living here for between 10 and 30 years
Some of the latter say that they settled in the area when the banks of the Musi River were still forested
Quite a few large houses constructed in the traditional Palembang style are still to be seen in the kelurahan, while there are several others, built around 1912, whose architectural style incorporates Chinese elements
Like other river-bank settlements along the Musi, 5 Ulu kelurahan is densely populated, with a current population of 23,917 persons
The majority of these people earn a living as daily wage workers in the transportation sector, in factories and in markets
Dependence on daily wage work explains why most of the households are quite poor
The settlement pattern is unplanned, and most of the housing areas along the river are linked by well-elevated concrete or wooden paths because they would otherwise be submerged at high tide
The river, which is extremely muddy, provides water for drinking, bathing, washing and sanitation purposes for the greater majority of households
Only a very small number obtain water from wells or from the government Drinking Water Company (PAM)
Land holdings, especially those belonging to newcomers, are generally very small and have been obtained from tanah usaha, that is, from once-forested land that has been cleared by an individual
The individual's right to the cleared land has then been confirmed by a statement from the heads of the RT and the kelurahan
By contrast, the indigenous residents own large land holdings that have budel status (that is, land with ownership rights which has been handed down from one generation to the next)
Its ownership status stems from the time of the Dutch colonial government
Before the LAP was commenced, most of the land holdings of people in this kelurahan had no certificates
Only people who were relatively well off could afford to pay the cost of a land certificate through sporadic registration
The success of the LAP is apparent from the fact that most of the people in 5 Ulu kelurahan now have certificates for their land
14 Medan City (urban) 
A Kota Matsum I Kelurahan, Medan Area Sub-district 
The Kota Matsum I kelurahan is located in the center of the city of Medan
It is 5 km from the actual capital of the province and is linked by very good transportation
While part of the kelurahan is used for shops and businesses, most of the land is occupied by houses
Apart from a football field, there are no open spaces or empty land in the kelurahan, which covers 0.34 km2 (8% of the subdistrict)
It has a population of 12,461 persons (2,815 households), many of whom are very poor
Some 30 % of the residents are employed in small-scale trade and run food stalls and shops that sell second-hand goods, which include spare parts for automobiles and car seats
Kota Matsum I is one of the Medan kelurahan in which much of the land has the status of Sultan's Grant land
This land is controlled by a small number of people who are the heirs of the original recipients of the Grant
Even though some parcels of land have already been purchased by people who once rented them, much land is still held by the heirs, who rent it out to local people
On the whole, the people who have purchased this land, like those who still have tenant status, have very small parcels that are usually just sufficient for a house and yard
These tenants have been renting the land for more than 60 years; in fact, quite a few have rented it for hundreds of years
They normally pay an annual rent of around Rp600,000 per parcel to the owner
At the time when the LAP was conducted, land parcels that had already been purchased were included for certification, whereas those with rented status were excluded
This is one factor that explains why the LAP achieved very low results in terms of number of parcels registered in Kota Matsum I Kelurahan
The present land status situation has caused much uneasiness among tenants for, although they are renting the land, they are the legal owners of the houses that they built at their own expense on that land
B Pasar Merah Timur kelurahan, Medan Area Sub-district 
Pasar Merah Timur kelurahan, the control area, is located opposite Kota Matsum I kelurahan
It covers approximately 0.75 km2 and is five kilometers from the provincial capital
Many of the residents are employed in the Public Service or in private businesses, 
while a large proportion earn a livelihood from trade of some kind
On the whole conditions in this kelurahan are better than in Kota Matsum I and there are relatively fewer poor households
Pasar Merah Timur has a population of 11,951 persons (2,697 households), which makes density per square kilometer somewhat lower than in Kota Matsum I
Furthermore, the economic situation of the residents is somewhat better
At the same time there is much less land with the status of Sultan's Grant land
For that reason some of the residents already have land certificates obtained through either PRONA or sporadic registration
This is perhaps one of the reasons why the LAP was not carried out in this kelurahan, even though local officials say that there are still a lot of people without land certificates
Those who do not have a certificate very much hope that the LAP will be implemented in their area
The kelurahan is almost completely built up but houses and other buildings follow an orderly plan
Access to the area is extremely easy with various means of transport readily available
Even so, there are certain parts of the kelurahan that have poor drainage and slum conditions
Educational facilities from elementary schools to senior high schools are available in the kelurahan
SUMMARY
East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) is one of the provinces in Indonesia with a relatively high poverty rate
For this reason, many poverty reduction programs have been implemented in this region, including microfinance services
This study aims to look at the dynamics of the supply of, and demand for, microfinance services in connection with poverty reduction in NTT
A qualitative approach was adopted to understand these dynamics by collecting primary and secondary data on microfinance regulations and services, especially in Kabupaten Kupang and Kabupaten Manggarai
The effectiveness of these regulations and services was determined through interviews with both individuals who use microfinance services and those who do not
Microfinance services are limited by policies, funding and personnel, whereas the needs of the poor for financial services vary
Their needs vary because of the types of businesses people own, their socioeconomic conditions and the geographical locations of villages
In relation to loans, for example, businesses owned by the poor do not always need additional capital
The poor often need loans to cover various unexpected non-business related expenses
For poor groups, loans for these purposes are required so that these expenses do not disrupt asset ownership and business sustainability
Banking institutions are one type of financial service provider
These institutions are strictly commercially-oriented
Banks in NTT, for example, do not have special financial service schemes for the poor
Thus, it is difficult for poor groups in NTT to access banking services because their needs and socioeconomic conditions are generally incompatible with the prevailing policies in the banking sector
The access of poor groups who live in rural areas is even more limited because banking services are located far away in urban areas
Outside of the formal banking sector, poor groups can obtain financial services from nonbanking institutions, non-formal institutions and microfinance enterprise units established as a component of government development programs
Small-scale loans are the main services provided by these institutions
The problem is, except for pawnshops, there is a tendency for only poor groups who own non-agricultural enterprises to have easy access to these loans, because non-agricultural enterprises are considered to have better credit ratings
The majority of services from these institutions are channeled through community groups, both groups established through a community's own initiative as well as those formed to meet program requirements
One problem faced by these community groups is sustainability
Often groups, especially those formed specifically for programs, eventually disband after funds have rotated to other groups or the program finishes
Groups can survive and develop if adequate technical assistance is provided for group management and the members' businesses
Groups like these usually develop savings activities which support the long-term sustainability of finance services
Apart from that, the poor traditionally met their own needs for financial services through arisan (rotating savings) activities or, in urgent situations, by borrowing money from neighbors or moneylenders for daily necessities or business purposes
There are a lot of arisan activities in areas where there are a limited number of financial institutions
Various arisan groups develop savings activities as a way of providing small-scale loans for their members
Cattle ranching businesses and storing harvest produce in barns, for example, are two means of savings money which simultaneously provide insurance
Food storage barns will provide them with security during famines and the dry season, whereas livestock are a source of funds for pressing needs
I INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and Objectives
Poverty is still a major problem in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) because of the high proportion of poor people and the low level of economic development compared with the Indonesian average
There have been various attempts to reduce poverty in this province, including the provision of microfinance
Microfinance is considered an important strategy in poverty alleviation
In Indonesia, several microfinance services have been regarded as successful in reducing poverty, among them the rural branches of the Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) (Robinson, 306-362), microcredit provided through the Rural Income Generation Project (P4K), as well as microfinance services provided by Bank Purba in Semarang and Mitra Karya in East Java (Seibel and Parhusip, 1-28)
Although studies in a number of countries have highlighted the success of microfinance in reducing poverty, several analyses have acknowledged that the ability of microfinance to lift the poor, particularly the poorest of the poor, out of poverty has some limits
In addition, local conditions and the design of microfinance services will influence their success in reducing poverty
This study tries to analyse whether the provision of microfinance services is likely to be an effective tool for poverty alleviation in NTT
In order to do so, it has attempted to
1. Observe the current microfinance services in NTT and how far these services are capable of reaching, or being reached by, the poor
2. Identify the types of microfinance services that are not yet available for the poor in NTT
3. Identify the size of the poor's demand for microfinance services which are not yet available
4. Identify the factors that cause the unavailability of certain microfinance services in NTT
5. Observe the technical support in place for microfinance activities in NTT, including regulations and supervision, both that provided by institutions in the province as well as institutions outside NTT
6. Formulate an appropriate approach to developing microfinance (as an independent program or as a component of a program) based on the findings related to the points above
7. Formulate an alternative form of assistance from funding agencies to reduce the gap between the demand for and supply of microfinance in NTT
1.2 Research Methodology
This study adopts a qualitative approach to analysing data and information gathered in Jakarta and NTT
This approach was chosen in order to obtain a deep understanding in a relatively short time period because this study was conducted over three months, between July and September 2004
During this study period the research team collected information from a number of relevant institutions in Jakarta and NTT
The research team visited two kabupaten in NTT -Kupang and Manggarai- during the first two weeks of August
During this field trip, the research team collected primary and secondary data at the provincial, kabupaten, kecamatan, and village levels, and conducted interviews with individuals, particularly poor households who had received microfinance services and those who had not
Secondary data was collected through a review of relevant documents and interviews with regional government offices which manage programs with microfinance components, microfinance providers including banks as well as formal non-banking and non-formal financial institutions, and microfinance observers in NTT
Interviews were based upon guidelines developed for each type of institution
Primary data was collected through indepth interviews with communities (respondents)
The objective of the interview with respondents was to assess the accessibility and benefits of microfinance services from a community perspective, as well as to identify communities' demand for microfinance
Information about the institutions, as well as the location of respondents interviewed are provided in Appendix 1.1
The selection of sample regions was based on the distance from an economic center and the numbers of microfinance providers
Kabupaten Kupang was selected because it is relatively close to an economic center and there are many microfinance services
Kabupaten Manggarai, on the other hand, was selected because it is relatively far from economic centers and there are fewer microfinance services
The research team visited two kecamatan in each kabupaten, one kecamatan which is relatively close to an economic center and one which is relatively remote
In each kecamatan, the team visited a minimum of one village that is serviced by the selected samples of microfinance services
The sample villages in Kabupaten Kupang were Kelurahan Oesao in Kecamatan Kupang Timur and Desa Ponain in Kecamatan Amarasi
The sample regions in Kabupaten Manggarai were Kelurahan Wae Belang in Kecamatan Ruteng and Desa Golo Kantar in Kecamatan Borong
To observe several microfinance services that are not available in the sample regions, the research team also visited Desa Tarus, Desa Bao Bao and Kelurahan Merdeka in Kecamatan Kupang Timur, as well as Desa Bea Kondo in Kecamatan Satarmese, Kabupaten Manggarai
In general, microfinance service providers observed in this study could be classified into four groups
1. Formal institutions, that is institutions that are legal entities formally recognized by the existing law as financial institutions
Formal institutions consist of two groups that are banks and non-banking institutions
The banks visited included BRI, Bank Mandiri, Bank NTT and the People's Credit Bank (BPR), whereas the non-banking institutions included Village Credit Board (BPD), cooperatives, Village Cooperative (KUD), credit unions, Regional Credit Cooperatives Coordinating Board (BK3D) and pawnshops
2. Non-formal institutions, that is institutions which have a legal base -both legal entities such as foundations, and institutions with other legal bases such as a decree from a governor or bupati, but are not authorized to operate, or are not acknowledged, as formal financial institutions under the existing laws and regulations
Non-formal institutions include savings and loans units (USPs) and non-government organizations (NGOs) which provide microfinance services
The non-formal institutions visited during this study included Yayasan Alfa Omega (YAO), Tanaoba Lais Manekat (TLM), Foundation for the Development of Sea and Coastal Regions (YPPL - Yayasan Pengembangun Pesisir dan Laut), Yayasan Sanlima, Yayasan AYO Indonesia and Yayasan Delsos
3. Government programs that provide microfinance services or have a microfinance component, generally in the form of microcredit
To find out about these programs, the study team conducted interviews and collected secondary data from various sectoral offices at the provincial and district levels, including the office for cooperatives, office for food crops, office for plantations, office for fisheries, office for industry and trade, and offices that deal with family welfare and family planning
4. Informal institutions, that is institutions which are non-legal entities, such as community rotating savings (arisan) groups, church groups and other informal sources
This study mainly observed informal institutions formed by the community themselves
The activities of these institutions were uncovered through interviews with group members and administrators
1.3 Report Structure
This report consists of six chapters
Chapter I is an introduction that provides the background and objectives of the study, the methodology used, and report structure
Review of literature that focuses on the relationship between microfinance services and poverty reduction, as well as a general illustration of NTT and the two kabupaten included in the study
Chapter II provides a brief overview of microfinance services in Indonesia as a background for understanding the state of microfinance services at the national level
More specifically, this chapter highlights the development of microfinance institutions, the scope and performance of microfinance institutions at the national level, as well as the existing microfinance infrastructure
Chapter III provides a description of several microfinance services in NTT, specifically in the sample regions
It presents the issues regarding the type of services available, scope of services, performance of service
Chapter IV illustrates the poor's utilization of, and demand for, microfinance services in the sample regions
In order to provide the context of the poor's demand for microfinance institutions in NTT, this chapter also presents the livelihood of the communities in the sample regions, the microfinance services they can obtain, and their demand for microfinance services
Chapter V discusses the field findings in the context of the existing and the potential roles of microfinance services as a tool for poverty alleviation in NTT
Chapter VI presents conclusions derived from this study and highlights some recommendations for funding agencies and local governments
1.4 Microfinance Services and Poverty Reduction
A Literature Review 
To date, microfinance is still considered one of the key strategies in poverty reduction
Studies in various countries have highlighted the benefits of microfinance in increasing the poor's standard of living
However, poor communities are not a homogenous entity, and the strategy and design of microfinance services have changed in line with developments in thinking on, and understanding of, the poor (Marin, Hulme and Rutherford, 4)
During the period when the government provided subsidized agricultural credit (1950s - 1970s), the poor were considered as marginalized farmers, usually males, who needed to increase their productivity, which could be done through the provision of credit
In the 1980s, the poor were considered as microbusiness owners, generally female, who did not own assets that could be used as collateral despite their businesses having good prospects
As a result, there were many attempts by NGOs to provide microcredit particularly for women
The argument that the poor require greater access to credit rather than credit with subsidized interest rates provided a backdrop for the move from subsidized credit to non-subsidized credit
Microcredit developed further during the 1990s with innovations in ways of channelling credit through groups using the Grameen Bank model, where groups of poor women were the main targets
This model attracted worldwide attention, was adopted in many countries and attracted support from many funding agencies
This development led to the emergence of a microfinance industry that emphasized the financial viability and sustainability of microfinance service providers
This development was accompanied by a large effort to increase the number of clients or the size of loans held by each client (Kalpana, 7-8)
At the end of the 1990s, several studies were critical of the increased tendency to exclude the poorest of the poor from microfinance services
A phenomenon has been observed as a side effect of the excessive emphasis on high repayments rate and the institutional viability of microfinance service providers
In 2003, for example, the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), stated that(Fernando, 1)
In this regard, Kalpana identified at least four factors that exclude the poorest of the poor from microfinance services, that are
1. Inflexible loans with strict weekly repayments and an absence of savings services
2. The dominance of program staff over clients, so restricting two-way communication
3. A supervisory system between individuals in a group that, in fact, excludes the poorest people or the unfortunate
and 4. Pressure to make repayments on time that triggers borrowers to become trapped in highinterest loans (8-12)
Matin, Hulme and Rutherford also suggested that the exclusion of the poorest was, in general, due to the design of microfinance services not taking into account the living patterns of this group
whose economic activities (production, consumption, trade, savings, loans and jobs) are conducted on a small scale and are highly vulnerable to economic shock (5)
The debate on the exclusion of the poorest from microfinance services focuses on two different perspectives regarding the solutions
The first perspective believes that the poorest of the poor do not require microfinance services and that it is more appropriate for them to receive direct assistance
This perspective is based on the reasoning that the poorest, who generally live in isolated regions and have very limited access to transport and markets, are unable to repay loans
Thus, reducing poverty in this group can only be achieved through health, food, and education assistance and not credit (Robinson, 20)
In addition, there is also the argument that reaching the poorest of the poor is expensive and that the costs outweigh the benefits (level of savings and loans), and therefore it is impossible to guarantee the viability and sustainability of microfinance service providers (the Microfinance Gateway)
Meanwhile, the second perspective argues that even the poor should be able to access microfinance services and that these services must be designed to fit their needs
This perspective opposes the argument that microfinance services are unsuitable for the poorest of the poor (Matin, Hulme and Rutherford, 24-26)
The second perspective emphasizes the need to move the microfinance paradigm away from the focus on the promotion or support of economic businesses and towards microfinance that provides protection through savings, emergency loans or microinsurance
A lack of demand for microfinance services is usually due to the available services not taking the needs of the poor into account
As a result services need to be adapted to the needs of the poor in order to increase demand
Regarding the cost of providing services and sustainable institutions, there is an argument that if microfinance services are considered a basic necessity, such as health and education, then there is no reason not to provide subsidies for the provision of microfinance service
In the case of savings programs for the poorest of the poor, experiences of SafeSave in Dhaka, Bangladesh indicate that a highly flexible savings and credit program for the urban poor can actually be managed in a sustainable way (27-28)
1.5 General Picture of NTT and the Sample Kabupaten
The province of NTT covers 566 small and large islands with a land area of 47,300km2 (2.5% of Indonesia) and a sea area reaching 200,000km2 in addition to Indonesia's Exclusive Economic Zone (IEEZ) beyond the Indonesian territorial sea
In 2001, there were 42 inhabited islands, including four large islands, that is Flores, Sumba, West Timor and the Alor Islands
All of the islands are mountainous with small pockets of flat land, and the average land gradient is greater than 50 degrees
The topography of this region poses a major challenge for transport and communication in this province
Transport infrastructure and facilities are still very limited in terms of quantity, quality and frequency
Sea transport has a very strategic role as there are 22 seaports complete with docks and 12 traditional ports
A variety of sea vessels stop off at these ports
In addition, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of flight paths and the frequency of flights, particularly to the kabupaten capitals
For the capital of Kabupaten Kupang, which is located in the capital of NTT, access to transport heading out of the region is relatively easy because there is a large port and an airport with daily flights to Jakarta and Surabaya
Access to transport within this kabupaten is, however, still limited
Some of the regions are difficult to reach, especially in the wet season
The access to the capital of Kabupaten Manggarai is not as easy as the access to the capital of Kabupaten Kupang
Ruteng, the kabupaten capital of Kabupaten Manggarai is located in the mountains, 4-5 hours to the north or west of any large port
There is an airport in Ruteng but the flights to Kupang do not leave everyday
Transport within the kabupaten is also still poor, particularly because it is mountainous terrain
In general, NTT has a very dry climate compared with the rest of Indonesia
The dry season lasts for between eight and nine months while the wet season only lasts for around three to four months
The topsoil is relatively thin because of the region's rocky structure and there is little vegetation cover, thus it is vulnerable to erosion
Kabupaten Manggarai is, however, somewhat different because the rainfall in several locations is relatively high and the wet season can last seven to eight months a year
In relation to soil fertility, the regions in Kabupaten Manggarai are more fertile than those in Kabupaten Kupang, as there are active volcanoes in Manggarai
Although land conditions provide limited support for agricultural activities, the agricultural sector still dominates the economy in NTT
In 2001, the agricultural sector accounted for around 42% of the gross domestic regional product (GDRP), whereas the manufacturing industry accounted for less than 2%
Some of the products farmed by communities include food crops (corn, rice and cassava) and plantation crops (coffee, cashew nuts, coconut, candle nuts, kapok, and vanilla)
NTT is also a main livestock producer in Indonesia
The agricultural sectors in the two sample kabupaten, particularly Manggarai, also provide large contributions
The agricultural sector in Kupang accounts for around 49% of the kabupaten's GDP, and the population of its main commodities, beef cattle and buffaloes, make up 25% of the total number of livestock in NTT
The agricultural sector contributes around 60% of the GDP in Kabupaten Manggarai through food crops, particularly rice which is a mainstay
Kabupaten Manggarai is the main producer of rice in NTT accounting for almost 27% of the province's rice production
Other than this, plantation crops, particularly coffee and chocolate, are also primary commodities
The limitations in economic activities in the province are also reflected in the low per capita gross regional product
The per capita gross regional product in 2001 was only around Rp1.9 million in NTT Province, Rp2.1 million in Kabupaten Kupang and Rp1.4 million in Kabupaten Manggarai, all of which are far below the Indonesian average which reaches around Rp6.9 million per capita
The economic status of communities is also relatively low and there is a high level of poverty
As is apparent in Figure 1.1, poverty figures calculated on the basis of consumption indicate that the level of poverty in NTT is higher than the Indonesian average
Meanwhile, it is evident that there is a higher level of poverty in Kabupaten Kupang than Kabupaten Manggarai
Poverty in NTT is also apparent from the low level of human development as shown in Table 1.2
The health, education and economic conditions of people in NTT and the two sample kabupaten are relatively lower than the national averages
Between the two sample kabupaten, human development conditions are better in Manggarai, in particular because of higher education levels and better economic conditions
Kabupaten Manggarai, however, actually lags behind Kupang in relation to the provision of health services and clean water
II MICROFINANCE IN INDONESIA
A BRIEF OVERVIEW
2.1 The History of Microfinance
The first formal microfinance institutions in Indonesia began in the late 19th century with the establishment of the People's Credit Bank and Lumbung Desa
These two institutions were formed in order to assist farmers, white collar workers and labourers to free themselves from loan sharks
In 1905, the People's Credit Bank was upgraded to become the Village Bank whose services were expanded to include business activities outside the agricultural sector (Bank of Indonesia, 2)
In 1929, the East Indies government published Gazette 1929 No
137 on the establishment of the Village Credit Board (BKD) which aimed to manage rural credit schemes in Java and Bali
In 1930, a regulation was issued on Algemene Volkskrediet Bank (AVB) which is now known as BRI, and Afdeelingsbank (AB) which then became BPR (Robinson 93-94, Chotim and Handayani, 15-20)
After independence, the Indonesian government encouraged the establishment of banks specializing in small, low-interest loans in order to provide financial services to market traders
These institutions were registered as private and public companies (perseroan terbatas - PT), partnerships (commanditaire vennootschap - CV), cooperatives, Indonesian-owned companies (MAI), foundations or associations
In 1970, the government created Bimas and Inmas the funding for which was channelled through the rural branches of BRI
Because a large amount of Bimas funds were not repaid however, this credit program (including small and medium-scale credit) ceased in 1984
After this, the rural branches of BRI developed a new commercial savings and credit scheme which was called Kupedes (rural credit scheme) and Simpedes (rural savings scheme)
The Bimas credit program was replaced by Credit for Farmers (KUT), which later became the Food Security Credit Program (KKP)
With the ratification of Law No
14/1967 on Banking Regulations, it became illegal to establish a bank without adhering to the above law, but those which already existed were allowed to continue to operate
At that time, several microfinance institutions had been established by the regional governments, for example, the Rural Credit and Funds Institution (LDKP) in West Java, the Kecamatan Credit Board (BKK) in Central Java, Credit for Smallscale Businesses (KURK) in East Java, Lumbung Pitih Negari (LPN) in West Sumatra, and the Village Credit Institution (LPD) in Bali (Bank Indonesia, 2)
In October 1988, the government issued a regulation which made it easier to establish BPRs
This was followed by the passing of Law No
7/1992 on Banking, which established that there would only be two types of banks in Indonesia, that is commercial banks and BPRs
After this law came into effect, banks and microfinance institutions (MFIs) that did not fulfil the requirements to become a BPR were considered as illegal banks or non-formal banks as they are usually known
As a result, the status of around 5,000 BKD branches is currently unknown, with some being considered formal and others considered semi-formal
In addition, the government has also implemented a number of microcredit programs in order to reduce poverty
In its implementation, microfinance institutions such as UPK (PPK), BKM (P2KP), LEP-M3  etc
Provincial and kabupaten/kota governments also adopted similar projects within their development programs
Meanwhile, several NGOs and funding agencies formed microfinance institutions using approaches that had been successfully developed overseas, such as the Grameen Bank model and the Association for Social Advancement (ASA) in Bangladesh
The application of these approaches in Indonesia by Bina Swadaya, Yayasan Dharma Bhakti Parasahabat, Yayasan Mitra Usaha and Bina Masyarakat Mandiri has been somewhat successful
In an effort to strengthen the position of these institutions, a joint forum for developing microfinance (Gema PKM Indonesia) was established in 2000
This forum provided a platform for communication between stakeholders, including financial institutions, the business community, the mass media, funding agencies and community self-reliance groups (Ismawan, 1)
This forum is pushing for the formulation of laws and regulations on microfinance institution, but to date has not been successful
From the explanation above it can be concluded that, in addition to the microfinance branches of commercial banks such as BRI rural branches and micro services units, the only microfinance institutions legally permitted in Indonesia are BPRs and cooperatives
Pawnshops are another formal financial institution which also provides microfinance services but they are regulated by a separate law
Thus, microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Indonesia can be classified as
1) formal MFIs, including banks and non-banks, 2) non-formal MFIs, including those that are legal entities and those which are not, 3) MFIs established under government programs, or 4) informal MFIs, including arisan groups, moneylenders and so forth
2.2 The Scope and Performance of Microfinance
A profile of MFIs in Indonesia in terms of their number of branches, loans disbursed and savings is provided in Table 2.1
The rural branches of BRI are still the most dominant formal institutions in microfinance services, both in the provision of loans as well as the mobilization of savings
BPRs, which have experienced rapid growth in recent years, also make a significant contribution, both in terms of loans as well as savings
Meanwhile, pawnshops have shown the best performance amongst non-bank formal institutions
In fact, with regard to the number of debtors, pawnshops have the highest ranking
Other than non-formal institutions such as Baitul Mal wa Tanwil (an Islamic-based savings and loans institution - BMT) and BK3D, a large amount of funding for microfinance is provided by programs run by the central government
The most prominent programs include People's Prosperity Business Credit (Kukesra), P2KP, P4K, Kecamatan Development Program (KDP), and a project to economically empower coastal communities (PEMP)
These programs have attracted quite a few debtors
For example, Kukesra has 10.3 million debtors, P2KP has 3.2 million debtors and the Microcredit Program (PKM) has 2.3 million debtors
The relinquishment of several programs to local community initiatives and the implementation of decentralization has, however, made it difficult to obtain the most recent accurate data regarding the progress of these programs
For example, it is now difficult to determine whether a program is still running, progressing or if revolving funds have stopped
In addition, there is no national level data regarding the performance of informal microfinance services, such as arisan, loans from neighbours or loans from moneylenders
Although in principle microfinance is provided for the poor and low-income earners, it does not mean that all poor people enjoy this service
Based on existing information, for example, it appears that small-loans or credits provided by banks do not reach poor people, mainly because there is an obligation to provide collateral or prove business feasibility before receiving loans/credits
Meanwhile, the poor cannot enjoy a number of credit programs because the strong emphasis on the performance in terms of the repayment rate has excluded the poorest from becoming program beneficiaries
Furthermore, the performance of MFIs can be seen from the increase in the number of branches, amount of loans disbursed, amount of savings mobilized and the number of account holders
Table 2.2 indicates that the increase in the number of branches was not significant and, in fact, some of them, such as BPRs, have decreased in number due to the Indonesian Central Bank policy to restructure BPRs
There was a somewhat significant increase in the number of pawnshops and BRI branches
Unfortunately, this data does not provide information regarding the performance of MFIs that were formed on the basis of government programs nor informal MFIs
Table 2.3 shows the increase in loans, savings and account holders of several MFIs during the period of 2000 - 2003
It can be seen that the institutions with the greatest increase in the amount of loans provided were BPRs, with an increase of 150% during 2000-2003, even though the number of account holders only increased by 19.3%
There was also a large increase in the number of loans offered by pawnshops, which increased by more than 100%, and BRI which increased by around 75%
Similar trends can also be observed in the mobilization of savings
The amount of savings mobilized by BPRs increased more than 185%, much greater than the increases at BK3D (68.6%) and BRI (45%)
These results were related to the restructuring of MFIs by BI which specifically restructured BPRs as the only formal banks that provide microfinance recognized by BI
From the total amount of savings and loans, however, BRI still obtained the highest ranking
2.3 Microfinance Infrastructure
2.3.1 Microfinance Funding
In general, the funding for microfinance services could be provided by four types of source, including
1) central and regional governments, 2) non-government institutions such as banks, private organizations and state-owned enterprises (BUMN), 3) NGOs and funding agencies, and 4) the community through savings
Funding from the central government consists of Bank Indonesia Liquidity Credit (KLBI) and program funds
Since the 1960s, BI has provided liquidity credits that have been channelled to public banks for several subsidized credit programs in the agricultural sector and to assist the lower economic class and cooperatives
These credit programs include Bimas/Inmas, KUT, KKP, and loans for Small Businesses (KUK) and other programs for promoting small and medium enterprises
In addition, some program funds have been directed toward developing microfinance, specifically developed to reduce poverty, such as Presidential Aid for Underdeveloped Villages (IDT), KDP, P2KP, NTAADP, and Direct Community Assistance - Fuel Subsidy (BLM-BBM)
Taking these programs as a reference, the provincial and kabupaten governments also allocate funds in their regional budgets (APBD) for microfinance programs
After BI stopped disbursing credit programs, following the restriction put in place by Law No
23/1999 on the Bank of Indonesia, the management of credit programs (previously KLBI) was transferred to three executing banks
These banks included BRI which operates the programs providing credit for the members of primary cooperatives (KKPA) and credit for cooperatives (KKop); National Savings Bank (BTN) which operates programs providing credit for those wanting to buy simple houses (KPRS) and very simple houses (KPRSS); as well as the national financing institute (Permodalan Nasional Madani - PNM) which operates other program credit schemes
The amount of credit program funds reached Rp9.5 trillion for BRI, Rp3 trillion for BTN and Rp10.4 trillion for PNM
These funds must be returned to BI within five years
In the 1980s, the government made it compulsory for public banks to set aside around 20% of their loans for the lower economic class
But the implementatin of this policy failed
BI in collaboration with Bina Swadaya has also sought financial assistance for microfinance activities
In 1989 they began a program to develop links between banks and self-reliance groups (PHBK)
Yet, after Law No
23/1999 on the Bank of Indonesia was passed and as a result of the monetary crisis, this policy was stopped (Susapto, 5)
Since then, BI has facilitated inter-bank relations through PHBL (a program which develops links between banks and MFIs)
Until March 2004, this program had initiated the cooperation between 998 BPRs, out of 2,123 active BPRs, and 29 public banks and PNM with a funding ceiling of Rp736 billion as well as committed funds of Rp430 billion (Salam, 2 and Bank Indonesia, 147)
In addition, through Ministerial Decree No
316/KMK.016/1994, the government ordered BUMNs to put aside a maximum of 5% of their profits to assist small businesses and cooperatives, which is referred to as the Small Business and Cooperative Development (PUKK) program
Several funding agencies and NGOs have also supported the development in MFI activities
During 1979-2005, the Ministry of Agriculture, with funding support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) implemented P4K which provided access to credits and savings for the poor, the credit services of which were assigned to BRI
Similarly, between 1995 and 2001, BI conducted a PKM with funding support from the ADB as well as a grant from the Norwegian government
However, in 2001 BI handed over responsibility for this program to Bank Mandiri which had previously been a channelling institution
Meanwhile, Mercy Corps has acted as a wholesale service provider since 2000 by providing technical and financial assistance for local institutions in Indonesia
In 2002, the National Poverty Reduction Committee (KPK) and BI made an agreement to reduce poverty through developing small, medium and microbusinesses
This agreement was implemented by making it compulsory for public banks to include their microfinance funding plans and funding plans for small and medium businesses in their business plans
Based on this agreement, banks were to channel Rp4.6 trillion in funds into microbusinesses (Ismawan, 3)
However, because these activities were fully funded by each public bank, funding priorities were still given to existing account holders
New account holders were not prioritised and they even had to meet business feasibility standards according to banking requirements
As recently as early 2004, the government announced a microbusiness credit program that does not require business owners to provide collateral (KUM-LTA), as the government provides a credit guarantee
However, this program is considered to have political motives and its developments are so far unknown
Besides funding from the government, private sector, donors and non-government organizations, savings mobilized from the community contribute significantly, particularly for the banks
In addition, poor communities tend to use informal sources funded mostly by the communities themselves
The most popular form of informal microfinance is arisan that have been developed into loan and saving groups both in the form of money as well as goods such as rice
2.3.2 Regulations and Supervision
To date, there are no specific regulations on MFIs in Indonesia
Law No.7/1992 on Banking, which was modified by Law No.10/1998, only applies to one type of MFI, that is BPRs
Supervision of BPRs by BI is done through the Directorate for Supervision of People's Credit Banks
Other MFIs are cooperatives, and Law No.25/1992 on Cooperatives governs the supervision and regulation of these institutions
According to formal regulations, however, the activities of a cooperative only relate to the interests and prosperity of the members, including accumulating and channelling funds through savings and loans activities (section 43 and 44)
The legal status of many other MFIs is uncertain, both informal institutions and those which are legal entities, such as foundations as well as institutions established through government programs, governor or bupati decrees or otherwise
According to Section 19 of Government Regulation No.71/1992, MFIs should have applied for a business permit to become a BPR within five years of the government regulation on MFIs being enacted
Given this, MFIs which have yet to meet requirements as BPRs or become cooperatives, have thus become illegal banking institutions
In 2002, BI recorded 2,272 LDKPs which were operating without a legal basis, as well as 5,245 BKDs which had not fulfilled the requirements to operate as BPRs (Ibrahim 90)
Section 16 of Law No.7/1992 banned MFIs which are not authorized BPRs from mobilizing community funds (See Box 2.1.)
This section also states that there is a penalty of up to 15 years in jail and a maximum fine of Rp10 billion for offenders
This means that the funding for MFIs is very much dependent on program assistance or funding agencies, or only occurs within a small environment, such as with cooperatives
This regulation, according to MFI providers, somewhat hinders the development in microfinance service activities
Because of this circumstance, microbusiness owners have pushed for the formulation of laws and regulations which govern MFIs
In 2001, BI and the Ministry of Finance began to formulate a Microfinance bill
To date, this law has not been ratified and remains with the Ministry of Finance, because there are still several principal differences between the department and the microfinance providers
The Ministry of Finance believes that there are no significant differences between microfinance institutions and BPRs contained in the bill, particularly in regards to the mobilization of funds
But, microfinance providers object to Section 10 of the bill which states that there is an obligation for microfinance institutions that have collected savings of more than Rp1 billion to turn into BPRs (Law No
10/1998 on Banking) or cooperatives (Law No
25/1992 on Cooperatives)
They argued that MFIs have their own special characteristics which are different from BPRs, such as group-operated credit services, shared responsibilities, and financing targets specifically for the poor
2.3.3 Capacity Building
BI has admitted that the lack of institutional building has hindered the development of MFIs
It is because BI, in general, is responsible mainly for strengthening the capacity of banks which provide microfinance, that is BPRs
BI, through the Directorate for Supervision of People's Credit Banks, has implemented several policies to strengthen BPRs, such as programs to restructure BPRs as well as strengthen BPR infrastructure and capacity, research, and supporting the cooperation between public banks and BPRs
In general BI's policies relating to institutional capacity building cover
1) empowerment of associations and networks, 2) training and certification, 3) information technology, 4) linkage programs, 5) establishment of savings and loans institutions (LPSs), and 6) pioneering the establishment of Apex (Salam, 105)
Nevertheless, these programs have also touched other MFIs, particularly formal MFIs
For example, BI has developed an integrated information system for the development of small businesses (SI-PUK) which covered the Baseline Economic Survey information system, agroindustry, and the financing patterns of small businesses; and then training activities, linkage programs and so forth
Other MFIs and the public could also access these programs
International organizations have also carried out similar activities
In 2001 GTZ through the Promotion of Small Financial Institutions (ProFi), and in collaboration with Indonesian Association of BPRs (Perbarindo) in East Java and BI, provided training, management consultation and legal support for BPRs
Similar activities were also carried out in Kapubaten Alor, NTT
In addition, BI in collaboration with USAID and the Indonesian Business Institute (IBI) organized a seminar about the most appropriate information technology for BPRs
Capacity building for MFIs in the form of cooperatives and non-formal MFIs is generally carried out by the relevant government offices at the central and provincial levels, or more specifically the Office for Cooperatives, Small and Medium Businesses and the Office for Industry and Trade
Several NGOs have also provided assistance for MFIs, such as what has been carried out by the Center for Small Business Development (PINBUK)
Some capacity building activities included
funding assistance, training, technical assistance, provision of facilities, information and promotion
For example, in addition to providing loans, the small business and cooperative empowerment program (PUKK) also funds training, promotion, and marketing programs for small businesses
Furthermore, Gema PKM Indonesia, which was founded on 10 March 2000, is attempting to support joint activities to improve MFIs as a means of poverty reduction in Indonesia
Activities have included meetings with stakeholders, formulation of the draft MFI bill, engagement in international movements, capacity building, and the promotion of microfinance
III MICROFINANCE SERVICES IN NTT
Microfinance has become an important policy strategy for poverty reduction in NTT
Both government and non-government organizations have been directly involved in the provision of microfinance services for various community groups, particularly those that are considered to have limited economic capacity such as small traders, household industries, low level employment and labourers, as well as farmers and fishermen
Various types of MFIs such as banks, pawnshops, cooperatives, MFIs managed by NGOs, government programs with microfinance components and informal MFIs developed and managed by the communities themselves, have been identified in NTT and in the sample regions in particular
These MFIs have different characteristics in terms of geographical coverage, institutional capacity, range of services being offered, as well as targets of services
From the providers' point of view, microfinance is not only for poverty reduction effort but also for commercial purposes that is to maintain institutional sustainability of the MFIs, and for increasing production or productivity -particularly for the case of program credit
This chapter describes the profile and the activities of a variety of MFIs found in NTT, specifically in the sample regions in Kabupaten Kupang and Kabupaten Manggarai
3.1 Services Provided by Formal Institutions
3.1.1 Services Provided by Banking Institutions
As it is the second poorest province in Indonesia, NTT does not attract many banks to open and operate branches
Compared to West Nusa Tenggara (NTB), in 2001, there were only 30 branches of commercial banks in NTT, while there were around 100 branches of commercial bank in NTB
In general, these banks were state-owned banks such as BRI, the National Bank of Indonesia (BNI) or the NTT Regional Development Bank (BPD/Bank NTT)
Only Kota Kupang which is the provincial capital has a significant number of banks, including BI, Bank Mandiri, Bank Central Asia (BCA) and the Public Bank for Indonesian Cooperatives (Bukopin)
In 2002 however, the number of bank branches in NTT increased by 100% in just one year, totalling 60 branches (Table 3.1)
The number of banks that, until 2001, averaged only one or two in each kabupaten increased to two or three establishments in 2002
It seems that this increase corresponded with the high economic growth in NTT's that reached 4.2% in 2000 and increased to 6% in 2002
This was lower than the national growth rate of 4.99% in 2000 but significantly higher than the rate of 3.8% in 2002 (BPS NTT 2002, 548)
On the other hand, two out five BPRs in NTT have recently shut down because they were unable to operate efficiently
The landscape of banking in NTT is therefore dominated by national commercial banks that have opened new branches in NTT
Another formal institution that has a significant number of establishments is the cooperatives movement
As can be seen in Table 3.1
there were more than 1,000 cooperative establishments in 2002 in NTT, although the number has not increased significantly in the last few years
There are several banks in NTT which provide microfinance services, including BRI, Bank NTT, Bank Mandiri and BPRs
Table 3.2 provides an illustration of the provision of microcredit and mobilization of savings by banks in 2003 in the sample regions
Table 3.3 presents the schemes of microcredits offered by these banks
BRI operates the rural credit program (Kupedes) and rural saving program (Simpedes) managed by BRI rural branches
There are 4 BRI rural branches in Kabupaten Kupang and there are 8 BRI rural branches in Manggarai (some of them now serve the new Kabupaten of West Manggarai)
Each BRI rural branch is equipped with 5 staff
a head of the branch, an account officer who manages credit, two book keepers, and a cashier
The account officer is a field officer who has to check and assess the creditworthiness and assets of a borrower, collect instalments, and supervise the borrowers
Each BRI rural branch in NTT serves between 500 to 1.000 borrowers
Bank NTT provides loans for consumption purposes, manages the Pundi Putri loan program, and the Bank NTT Peduli program which provides small loans of less than Rp5 million for poor families
In NTT, this bank has 15 branches and 9 sub-branches
The subbranches usually serve rural areas
The sub-branch of Oesao Village in Kabupaten Kupang, for example, should cover 9 kecamatan but it now effectively covers only 3 kecamatan
This sub-branch has 5 staff
a head of sub-branch, an account officer, a book keeper, and 2 cashiers
In Kabupaten Manggarai, Bank NTT has one branch located in Ruteng, the capital city of Kabupaten Manggarai, and no sub-branch
In addition, Bank Mandiri also operates the PUKK program
This program obtains funds from BUMNs which are required to set aside a maximum of 5% of their profits for microcredit (see Table 3.3)
In Manggarai, a BPR also provides microcredit for agricultural business and working capital
This BPR is located at the capital city of this Kabupaten, but its operation covers several kecamatans around the capital city through field officers who actively go out to the surrounding kecamatans
In principle, the government's political orientation and the internal policies of banks have already attempted to accommodate the need of the poor in accessing banking services
In reality, however, it is difficult to serve the poor as banks still have to take into account the feasibility of the business to which they are lending money as stipulated in Section 8 of Law No
7/1992 on Banking (see Box 2.1 on page 14)
Given this regulation, bank loans are generally only given to businesses that are already operating well and not to the poor who have just started their business so that they can escape poverty
For example, although the BRI rural branches operate the Kupedes K-3 scheme, which provides credit of up to Rp3 million without collateral, the provision of credit still needs to take into account business feasibility
As a result, it is still difficult for this product to reach the poor
Around 80% of the debtors at banks visited were white-collar workers or those with a stable income
Thus, there is only a small opportunity for the majority of the poor in NTT to access loans offered by banks
In addition to not having collateral, the poor are generally unable to meet the terms and conditions stipulated by banks, such as that a business must have been in operation for one year, be of a reasonable size, and be certified, as well as other legal requirements
Furthermore, the location of the bank that is limited to urban areas and the lack of a means of transport and communication in NTT make it even more difficult for the poor to make use of microfinance services provided by the existing chains of banks
3.1.2 Services Provided by Non-bank Institutions
The non-bank formal MFIs which provide microfinance services in NTT include pawnshops and cooperatives
Pawnshops in NTT only carry out their traditional task, i.e to lend money to individuals who want to pawn valuable items that are later redeemed within a certain timeframe
Loan schemes, which are repaid in instalments, and that have been developed in other regions have not yet been implemented in this province
On the other hand, not all cooperatives operated in this province adopted the cooperative's principles that are based on doing business from, for and by the members
Some cooperatives expand their activities and provide services for, or cooperate with, non-members, and there are some institutions identified as cooperatives focussed merely on commercial businesses rather than emphasizing solidarity between cooperative members
3.1.2.1 State-owned Pawnshops
State-owned pawnshops also provide microfinance services and thus it is appropriate to include them in the MFI category
The services offered by pawnshops are one source of microfinance that, from the perspective of loan terms and conditions, can be easily accessed by the poor, given that they possess items that can be pawned (see Box 3.1.)
Up until the end of 2003, there were 774 branches in Indonesia
This pawnshops network is serving 14.3 million account holders and credit to the value of Rp8.8 billion
However, the limited number of branches and the fact that they are located in urban areas impedes access to these services for the majority of the poor
For example, the pawnshops in Kecamatan Kupang Timur and Kota Ruteng serve six and seven of the surrounding kecamatan respectively
In 2003, the Kupang Timur branch provided credit of Rp4.4 billion for 26,039 customers
The average pawn value per customer is Rp167,000 and on average this branch serves 2,170 customers per month
The branch has 6 staff including a head of branch, an appraiser, a cashier, a person who is responsible for the warehouse and two guards
In the same year, the Ruteng branch provided credit of Rp8.76 billion to 19,375 customers
An average of 1,615 customers per month with an average pawn value of Rp448,000 per customer
The Ruteng Branch has 7 staff and one additional staff on contract
The fact that this branch recruited non-permanent staff indicates that this branch needs more staff
3.1.2.2 Cooperatives
Several NGOs, religious organizations (such as churches), and common people in NTT have formed cooperatives to provide microfinance services for the poor
Some of the relatively big cooperatives that provide microfinance services include Credit Cooperatives (Kopdit), Talenta Cooperative, Pusat Koperasi Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia (Puskopabri), and Pusat Koperasi Unit Desa (Puskud)
3.1.2.2.1 Credit Cooperatives
Among the cooperatives that currently operate in Indonesia, there are 1,039 cooperatives that specifically provide microfinance services in the form of savings and loans; they are referred to as credit cooperatives
Nationally, credit cooperatives have 378,115 members, loans of around Rp577.5 billion and savings of Rp543.9 billion, made up of Rp344.5 billion in compulsory and principal savings and Rp199.4 billion in voluntary savings (Elias, 31)
In NTT, there were 253 credit cooperatives with 44,985 members operating as of 31 December 2003
The amount of money loaned by these credit cooperatives reached Rp58.9 billion and the total amount of member savings reached Rp51.4 billion (see Table 3.4)
In Timor and Rote that cover seven kabupaten/kota, including Kota Kupang, Kabupaten Kupang, Alor, South Central Timor, North Central Timor, Rote Ndao and Belu, there are 53 credit cooperatives that are united under Puskopdit Timor (Kupang)
The puskopdit in Kabupaten Manggarai has 43 credit cooperatives, but only 16 of them are still active
These puskopdit are members of the national association of credit cooperatives, Inkopdit, which is located in Jakarta
Although cooperatives have attempted to be selective in providing loans in addition to requiring collateral (See Box 3.2), the level of non performing loans at credit cooperatives is relatively high
The level of non performing loans at the Samijaya Credit Cooperative in Kupang for example, reaches 15%, whereas at the Bunga Usaha and Hanura credit cooperatives in Kabupaten Manggarai, it reaches 25% and 33% respectively
3.1.2.2.2 Talenta Cooperative
Talenta Cooperative focuses its activities on saving and loans particularly in the form of microcredits
At the present time, there are around 4,000 active members in the Talenta Cooperative in Kabupaten Timor Tengah Selatan, Belu, Alor, Sikka, Ende and Roti Ndao
The outstanding loans were around Rp11 billion as of July 2004
With a start-up capital of Rp4.5 million, this cooperative accumulates capital from operational profits and additional funds from third parties
Nowadays, the third party fund managed by this cooperative accounts for Rp3 billion with an interest rate of 15% per annum, which is higher than bank's interest rates
A few years ago, this cooperative was able to provide an interest rate of 24% per annum for funds from third parties
The operation of this cooperative is supported by 89 staff
Most of them are field staff responsible for collecting instalments from the borrowers
The key to the success of its credit service is intensive interaction and communication with its members
Each field staff has to manage around 45 members
3.1.2.2.3 Pusat Koperasi Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia (Puskopabri)
Another MFI which takes the form of a cooperative and which is widely known to the communities in Kabupaten Kupang and Manggarai is Puskopabri
This cooperative is often referred to as a daily bank because loan instalments are generally made on a daily basis
As of June 2004, the East Kupang Puskopabri (Oesao) branch had outstanding loans totalling Rp65 million that had been provided to 200 customers
Puskopabri provides loans of between Rp100,000 and Rp1 million per customer
Loan conditions include owning a business, particularly a stall or kiosk, and possession of a national identity card
Puskopabri does not require the borrower to provide collateral, but it is compulsory for borrowers to save money
Puskopabri deducts 5% from the loan which is converted into savings but after that, borrowers are not allowed to add to their savings
Determining the feasibility of providing a loan to a potential Puskopabri borrower is the task of field officers
Thus, potential borrowers do not need to visit a branch in order to apply for a loan
They only need to meet a field officer
If an officer agrees to a request for credit, the money is handed over the next day
Borrowers also need not make credit repayments at Puskopabri branches
Field officers will collect repayments from a borrower's house or place of business
For this service, borrowers must pay a higher interest rate, that is 20% per month
As an example, if a member borrows Rp100,000, he/she must make daily repayments of Rp4,000 for 30 days
3.1.2.2.4 The Cattle Production Program Managed by Puskud
Puskud's cattle production program began in 2002
This program is managed directly by staff at Puskud's Kupang branch without involving village cooperatives or the regional government
In managing this program, Puskud assigns its staff to publicize the program and develop cooperation with communities, specifically the poor
Puskud obtained capital from the National Cooperative Business Association (NCBA) to purchase a supply of cows
Puskud chose the cattle-production business because NTT is renowned as a cattle-breeding and production region, particularly for the purpose of supplying meat to Jakarta and West Java, despite the cattle population having decreased recently
It is hoped that through this program NTT can regain its image as a cattle-breeding region
The potential areas for cattle-production identified are Kabupaten Kupang, South Central Timor, North Central Timor, and Belu
In Kabupaten Kupang, this program is located in Kecamatan Amarasi and the surrounding areas because of the large supply of cattle fodder and residents existing experience in cattle production
The success of Puskud's program in its first year encouraged further activities
There were many requests from cattle producers to join these activities
Puskud distributed 500 cows in 2002, around 2,000 in 2003 and 5,000 in 2004
At present, Puskud has received requests for around 5,000 cows, but this request could not be fulfilled because of the limited number of cows
To further support this program, Puskud hopes that the government will assist with the cultivation and expansion of land to cultivate fodder
The Agricultural Office has also implemented a similar program, but supervision is not as intensive as that in the Puskud program because of the limited number of extension workers
Several cattle traders in Kupang have also implemented a similar program
However, they completely relinquished the business to the cattle producers and do not provide assistants
As a result, the earnings are lower than that of the Puskud program
This profit sharing arrangement could be considered as a form of credit although the beneficiaries do not own the cows and bear limited responsible for any losses
The development and expansion of such a program could be considered as one alternative for poverty reduction efforts
3.2 Services Provided by Non-formal Institutions (MFIs Managed by NGOs)
Various non-government organizations (NGOs) are mushrooming in NTT, and they play significant roles in assisting and empowering poor communities
Some NGOs have activities that directly and indirectly relate to the provision of microfinance
Some of them that have been visited by the study team in Kabupaten Kupang and Kabupaten Manggarai, are primarily focusing on the provision of microfinance
They are Tanaoba Lais Manekat (TLM), Foundation for the Development of Sea-fishing and Coastal Community (YPPL), and UBSP Tunas Jaya
Other NGOs such as Alfa Omega Foundation (YAO), Sanlima Foundation and Delsos Foundation have units or divisions that provide microfinance services
Other NGOs like AYO Indonesia Foundation and many others provided indirect support to microfinance through their technical assistance to community loans and savings groups, both informal organizations as well as cooperatives
The following are some brief profiles of some of the NGOs that provide microfinance
3.2.1 Tanaoba Lais Manekat (TLM) Foundation - Kabupaten Kupang 
TLM was established by a church to assist with developing the community's economic activities and thus reduce poverty
TLM empowers communities and provides loans that function as a means of supporting productive businesses (SPUP)
Both individuals as well as groups who own farming businesses, such as seaweed cultivation, cattle production and small trading businesses, can receive SPUP (see box 3.5.)
SPUP groups are restricted to five members and repayments are a joint responsibility
Besides receiving loans, the borrowers also receive training on fund management and business development every three months
TLM requires prospective borrowers to have a business, permanent address and a savings account with TLM
The requirement for borrowers to own a business is based upon the belief that additional capital for the poor can only be provided to those who own a productive business and initial capital of around Rp500,000
According to TLM staff, the very poor cannot be empowered directly through the provision of capital
The first step that needs to be taken for them is to increase their motivation and improve their insight and skills through education and assistance
The aim of having a savings account is to educate customers so that they are able to accumulate their own capital and thus not depend on other parties
Because of this, TLM forces customers to make a saving each time they make a credit repayment (20% of the instalments)
Instalments are collected by the TLM field staff who visit the borrowers in their houses or the place where they run their business
At the present time, TLM's operational area covers West Timor, Rote and Alor which are served by 10 branches
It has around 13,000 active customers assisted by 13 field staff
Each field staff is assisting around 275 customers
Outstanding loans as of 30 July 2004 reached Rp7.5 billion with an average annual credit of Rp20 billion/year
TLM activities have received financial support and technical assistance from various institutions based in Europe, United States and Australia
3.2.2 Alfa Omega Foundation (YAO) - Kabupaten Kupang
YAO is one of the oldest NGOs in NTT and this foundation has developed many local NGOs in several kabupaten in West Timor and in Flores Island
YAO has two main activities that relate to microfinance
The first is strengthening the capacity of other microfinance institutions and the second is providing direct microfinance services to the community
In strengthening the capacity of other microfinance institutions, YAO provides technical assistance to a community based organization and develops it into a multi-purpose cooperative or loans and savings cooperative
Besides providing assistance for business development, seeking market opportunities and human resource management, YAO also provides capital assistance to the groups that are considered to have sufficient management capacity
The amount of a loan depends on the group's proposal and is in the range of Rp75 million to Rp100 million
The loan is to be repaid in 10 months with an interest of 0.75% per month
Nowadays, this activity has been mostly handed over to local NGOs associated with YAO that are located in 6 kabupaten
Kabupaten Kupang, Kupang City, Kabupaten Belu, Kabupaten Alor, Kabupaten Rote and Kabupaten South Central Timor
For all of these NGOs, YAO provides Rp 200 million in capital assistance to be directed to the community assisted by each NGO with a scheme that has been adjusted to local conditions
The microfinance unit of the YAO (MFI-YAO) manages the direct provision of microfinance services
The target groups of these microfinance services are the low-income classes who do not own collateral, especially women
MFI-YAO has two types of credit scheme; one with monthly repayments and the one with daily repayments (see Box 3.6.)
The activity of MFI-YAO covers Kabupaten Kupang, Kabupaten North Central Timor and Kabupaten Belu
The numbers of customers are 300 for loans with monthly repayments and another 300 for loans with daily repayments
The microfinance unit has 9 staff, consisting of 3 administrative staff and 6 field staff (2 in Belu and TTU, and 4 in Kupang)
The MFI unit finances the cost of all of these staff, and the profit from loan interest has covered the operational cost of this unit
The MFI activity is quite prospective, as the initial capital has grown from Rp50 million in 2000 to around Rp100 million in early 2004
The proportion of bad debts is also very small and it ranges from 5% to 10%
The bad debts have been handled in a very flexible way, such as by loan rescheduling so that no loan is written off and no penalty system is applied
The funding for MFI-YAO is mainly from profits that have been separated from YAO accounts, plus grants from NZAID
In addition, MFI-YAO also received funds for training from NZAID and JICA
3.2.3 Foundation for the Development of Sea-Fishing and Coastal Communities (YPPL) - Kabupaten Kupang
YPPL started its operation in 1998 as one unit within YAO, and it become independent in 2002
The activities of YPPL include assisting groups, providing capital assistance and raising community awareness for community empowerment, capital strengthening, capacity building and natural resource conservation
The target of this foundation covers coastal communities in Kupang Bay, North Coast of TTU and South Coast of Belu
Capital assistance is given to groups in the form of soft loans under the joint responsibility of all members of the group, and to individuals with monthly repayments (see Box 3.7.)
At the time of this study, YPPL has disbursed loans to 26 groups that have businesses in milkfish culture, marine fishing, agriculture, animal husbandry and shops, and 16 individuals who run animal husbandries and cattle trading
To run its activities, YPPL has received support from various donors and established cooperation with the government
Among others, YPPL received support from COREMAP AusAID in 1998
Since 2001, YPPL has established cooperation with the office for fisheries and marine resources for better management of natural resources through strengthening community based organizations in the coastal areas
3.2.4 Sanlima Foundation - Kabupaten Kupang
Sanlima Foundation has three main programs, namely research, democracy and the poor, and people's economy
Within the people's economy program, since 1999, Sanlima have provided loans in the same package as their business assistance
Up to the time of this study, the foundation has assisted 36 groups, 16 of which are located in Kabupaten Kupang and Kupang City
Business assistance has been delivered in the form of training in management and finance
Loans are given to a group of 6-10 members with joint responsibility (see Box 3.8.)
Each group makes a deposit of 10% from their loan, compulsory savings of Rp5,000 per person and voluntary savings in the amount decided by the group itself
The repayment rate is quite high
Loans financed from ASPUK funds have no bad debt, while others have bad debts of 5%-10%
The problems in loan repayments are usually caused by the fluctuation in prices that impact on the profitability of the business of the members of the group
Bad debts however, have been minimized through adopting a flexible scheme in accordance with the repayment capacity of the borrower
Five staffs run the microfinance and business assistance activities, but their cost has not been covered by the loans interest
The cost for their activities is financed by assistance funds provided by YIS Solo and ASPUK
Until now, only one staff has been fully financed from the interest collected from the 10 groups under this assistance program
3.2.4 Delsos Foundation - Kabupaten Manggarai
Delsos is part of a church organization with a primary objective of community development
In undertaking this task, Delsos performs socio-economic development activities for the community through training and microfinance
Among the training and community development programs are providing seeds and training in crop cultivation (in collaboration with Veko Indonesia), developing drinking water facilities in rural areas (in collaboration with the office for regional settlements and infrastructure development -Kimpraswil), rehabilitation of rural irrigation canals (in collaboration with local government and other NGOs), and reforestation and extension of tree-crops (in collaboration with the office of forestry and the office of plantation)
There are two channels for the provision of microfinance services, firstly via funds from the socio-economic development division of the Indonesian Church Committee (PSE-KWI) located in Jakarta, and secondly be providing microfinance through cooperative networks within church organizations
Funds from PSE-KWI are given to groups of small-businesses that have received training from the church
The groups has to submit a proposal to Delsos
For loans in the range of Rp1 million - Rp2 million, a group submits the proposal to Delsos with a recommendation from the priest
For loans ranging from Rp2 million to Rp25 million, a group has to submit the proposal to KWI with recommendations from the priest and Delsos
On the other hand, the network of cooperatives within the church provides savings and loans services for the members, who are staff of the church
The interest rate for the loans is 2% per month with a one-year repayment period
In 2000, Delsos Cooperative received funds from Kerosene Compensation Funds amounting to Rp100 million
This fund has to be paid back in 10 years beginning 2005
This is a revolving fund with an interest rate of 16% annually
This interest is divided into 10% for the cooperative saving (Delsos), 4% for the bank that provides technical assistance (BRI), and 2% for the task force within local government offices
The majority of this fund is used to increase the amount of loans for the members of the cooperative
3.2.5 Tunas Jaya Loans and Saving Group - Kabupaten Manggarai
Tunas Jaya Foundation was established for women's empowerment through life-skills training (weaving, sewing, embroidery, and small-scale agriculture and animal husbandry) and loans savings groups
The establishment of a loans and savings group is to provide a forum for independent group activities where the members of the group have basic saving, compulsory saving and voluntary saving
The group activities are also used as a medium for empowerment, such as to discuss gender issues and violence against women
The Tunas Jaya Foundation provides technical assistance in bookkeeping and group management in addition to capital assistance in the form of loans with an interest rate of 2% (flat)
Not all loans and savings groups can receive the capital assistance
Loans are provided only to the groups that are considered reliable in terms of their own capital, participation of members and the performance of their own loans repayments
The amount of loans is also very much limited by the financial capacity and the loan repayments from the groups that had received loans
Up to the time of this study, there are around 20 groups under Tunas Jaya network receiving assistance
Tunas Jaya activities are managed by 8 staff consisting of 3 administrative staff and 5 field staff
In addition, volunteers from each group carry out the communication between the loans and savings groups and the foundation
Tunas Jaya activities have been supported by funding from several non-recurrent grants such as KUSO, AusAID, Center for Studies in Regional Development (PSPK), VSO and SPARK
In addition, in 2000, Tunas Jaya received funding of Rp50 million from the Kerosene Compensation Subsidy with an annual interest rate of 16% to be paid monthly to a BRI account
The loan has to be paid back in 10 years beginning 2005
In managing this fund, Tunas Jaya received assistance from BRI and this assistance is considered to be very beneficial in improving the foundation's administration and book keeping systems
So far, the status of Tunas Jaya is as an MFI or a pra-cooperative
3.3 Services Provided through Government Programs
The provincial government of NTT as well as the district governments of Kabupaten Kupang and Kabupaten Manggarai have provided microfinance services as part of their regional development programs
The NTT provincial government used the development of rural MFIs as a strategy to push for an increase in medium and small-scale investment
The Kabupaten Kupang government set the provision of microcredit or revolving funds as one program in its community empowerment program by adopting programs similar to those that have already been applied, especially KDP (Kecamatan Development Program)
Similarly, the Kabupaten Manggarai government used revolving funds as part of the program to develop the household and village economies
In general, the programs related to microfinance have been carried out through the provision of microcredit programs managed by related sectoral offices and efforts at strengthening institutions that provide microfinance services
3.3.1 Credit Programs
3.3.1.1 Credit Objectives and Targets
Almost all sectoral offices have developed programs or activities that provide revolving funds in accordance with their area of authority
These funds, usually referred to as direct assistance to the communities, are aiming at increasing the business outputs of the recipients, both through business intensification as well as extension
Thus, these programs are not specifically aimed at reducing poverty, although it is hoped that improvements in production in every sector will improve the welfare of the people
This sectoral approach in channelling funds has made it easier for regional governments to divide projects between offices
Government credit programs target individuals, community groups, financial institutions such as savings and loans cooperatives/groups and other MFIs through procedures developed by each Kabupaten government (see Box 3.9)
Community groups, cooperatives and MFIs then channel funds to their members
Community groups are the targets for a large number of revolving funds activities managed by government offices
A group approach is considered to be the most ideal if it is related to efforts to strengthen the institutional capacity or effectiveness of a business
In practice, however, the group approach is not effective
A large number of program beneficiaries prefer to do business by themselves because they are reluctant to share risks
In general, program targets in Kabupaten Kupang are small traders and kiosk owners, cattle producers, small business/industry owners and fishermen, whereas in Kabupaten Manggarai they include rice farmers, small traders and kiosk owners, small business/industry owners, fishermen and cattle producers
The office for cooperatives and small-medium enterprises channels funds to microfinance institutions in rural areas
In addition, this office also channels funds directly to individuals, particularly to medium and small-scale enterprises
In Kabupaten Manggarai, the office for cooperatives and small-medium enterprises also provides funds to Village Credits Institution (LPD/LKP) and to savings and loans groups
3.3.1.2 Funding Sources and Credit Schemes
Funds for microcredit services come from the provincial, kabupaten/kota and national budgets (deconcentration funds)
Services funded by the national and provincial budgets are usually managed by the provincial governments who appoint high-ranking kabupaten project staff as the executors
The kabupaten government only has to provide recommendations on the selection of areas and beneficiaries
In addition, there are also national programs funded by the national budget for which the kabupaten-level technical offices are fully responsible
These include programs in the fisheries and marine sectors
In this regard, provincial budget allocations only supplement activities funded by the national budget
At the provincial level, the government offices involved in channelling microcredit are the Cooperatives and SMEs, Fisheries and Marine Affairs, Animal Husbandry as well as the Industry and Trade Offices
The provincial-level BPMD previously managed the channelling of microcredit which was referred to as UED-SP, but the authority has now been transferred to the kabupaten-level BPMD
The NTT provincial government also allocates funds to provide initial capital at Bank NTT
The name of the programs, source of funding, target groups and interest rates of the credit programs managed by the provincial-level technical offices are provided in Table 3.1
At the kabupaten level, the government also channels revolving funds using a model similar to the provincial level
This includes the government offices involved in the rural economy, such as BPMD, the Cooperative and SME Office, Industry and Trade Office, Food Crops Office, Agricultural, Forestry and Plantation Office, Fisheries and Marine Affairs Office as well as the Animal Husbandry Office
A list of program titles, their funding sources, targets and interest rates of microcredit programs managed by the government offices in Kabupaten Kupang and Kabupaten Manggarai are provided in Appendix Table 3.2 and Appendix Table 3.3
Among the sectoral offices channelling microcredits, the NTT provincial-level Cooperatives and SME Office and the Fisheries and Marine Affairs Office manage the greatest number of microfinance programs
The Cooperatives and SME Office manages the largest funds since almost all programs for developing small and medium enterprises funded by deconcentration funds are channelled through this office
The Marine Affairs Office also channels large amounts of funds for PEMP projects funded by the national budget
The Cooperatives and SME Office in Kabupaten Kupang channels the greatest amount of microcredit
In addition, as a major rice-producing area in NTT, Kabupaten Manggarai has allocated the greatest number of microcredit-channelling activities for improving rice production, particularly those funded by the national budget and managed by the Food Crop Office
Government offices channel both money and in-kind credit
In-kind credit comes in the form of agricultural tools and products, such as production input packages (seeds/seedlings, fertilizers and pesticides), equipment in the form of processors and sprayers, aquaculture and fishing equipment (fish/fish eggs, fishing boats and other fish farming equipment), as well as calves and cows
These funds come in the form of grants and loans which charge interest as well as no-interest loans (see Box 3.10)
However, in principle, all forms of credit must be revolved
3.3.1.3 Program Performance
The performance of the credit programs in the two sample kabupatens is similar, particularly regarding group activities and sustainability, program targets and loan repayments
Groups are only formed to make the channelling and repayment of funds smoother
Groups are often formed unexpectedly and are rarely based on social ties between members, and thus their existence is purely a formality
Groups are not headed by capable leaders because their level of education is generally low and they are usually busy with another job
In addition, the lack of guidance from, and monitoring by, the executing government office and poor assistance also cause group activities to become unsustainable
Regarding the selection of target groups, the sectoral approach could result in an overlap in targets between one government office and another
In principle, considering that funds are limited, allocations for each area, from the provincial level to the kabupaten/kota level or from the kabupaten/kota level to the kecamatan and village/kelurahan level, should be determined on the basis of the existence of other programs, institutional feasibility, regional potential and time rotations
Areas that have already benefited from assistance programs should not be prioritised
Only cooperatives and financial institutions that are financially sound should be given capital assistance
Cattle production programs should be carried out in areas that have high grazing potential, whereas rice field intensification and extension programs should be carried out in regions with widespread fields
Coordination at the village level however, is often problematic because all executing offices would like their programs to have good repayment rates
Thus they tend to select the groups with a good reputation
Consequently, there is a tendency for certain groups to always receive credits, while the others are left out
In addition, the limited access to information often benefited certain groups (the elites) that have better access to the information regarding credit programs
On the other hand, although business feasibility and the ability of a borrower to make installment repayments are important considerations in determining a program's targets, the repayment rates are mostly low and vary across business sectors (see Box 3.11)
The owners of kiosks or other trading businesses are program targets who have been relatively successful because they are capable of paying instalments on time
Cattle fattening activities in cattle centers also appear to be quite good because of the sufficient knowledge of and experience in cattle production and a guaranteed market
On the other hand, there is a greater likelihood of money loaned to farmers, plantation labourers and fishermen not being returned
The cultivation of food crops and plantation crops as well as aquaculture and fishing depend upon the natural environment
Unstable production levels and fluctuations in selling prices are reasons why fishermen and farmers are often unable to repay loans
In some cases, borrowed money is not always used entirely for business capital, but is also used for paying school fees, building a house or carrying out adat duties
In addition, the perception that all government assistance comes in the form of grants results in communities failing to make regular repayments
Due to the high level of outstanding loans, there is no continuity in the circulation of funds between groups or individuals and sometimes this comes to a halt
In general, it could be said that the involvement of government as a microcredit provider has created a conflict of interest
The function of government offices as a community facilitator conflicts with their function as an agency that ensures credit is repaid
Due to such a conflict, on one hand the function as a facilitator tends to be neglected, while on the other hand, the pressure to meet loan repayments causes communities to avoid meeting government officials
3.3.2 Efforts to Develop Village Level MFIs
Besides providing credit programs, local governments are also providing support to strengthen MFIs through funding and technical assistance
It has already been stated in Chapter 3.3.1 that Cooperatives and SME Offices, both at the provincial and kabupaten levels, have channelled funds to cooperatives, non-formal MFIs and informal MFIs
In strengthening community institutions, several government technical offices recruit facilitators to facilitate village-level financial institutions, such as cooperatives and community groups, as well as directly servicing the communities themselves
Assistance is generally not continuous considering the technical and financial restrictions, and thus it is ineffective
The existence of a facilitator for cooperatives in Kabupaten Manggarai, for example, is considered ineffectual because the educational background of the facilitator does not correspond with the demands of the position, and some people consider the facilitators to have fewer capabilities than the cooperatives' managers
In particular, the government of Kabupaten Manggarai has developed MFIs in the form of Village Credit Institutions (LPDs) or Kelurahan Credit Institutions (LPKs)
The structure and duties of these institutions are similar to the institutions that have existed in other provinces such as East Java and Bali (see Chapter 2)
Developing LPDs and LPKs in Kabupaten Manggarai, is the main program of the Village Community Empowerment Board (BPMD) and it is aiming to stop community members borrowing from high-interest moneylenders, to prevent forward selling of crops and to meet the poor's need for capital
The establishment of this village level MFI is to provide an institution to pull together all funds that have been channelled to village communities, such as funds from UED-SP and IDT programs, as well as funds from other sectoral offices including KDP and NTAADP
In principle, LPD/LPK activities are intended to be similar to credit cooperatives with wider coverage to include all households in the respective village
In establishing LPD/Ks the BPMD Kabupaten Manggarai provides start up funds of Rp25 million to an UBSP selected to be developed as LPD/K and assigns a technical advisor to assist the UBSP managers
UBSPs conduct group activities initiated by communities; these generally begin with arisan activities but have developed into savings and loans activities
Up until August 2004, 12 LPD/Ks had been formed in Kabupaten Manggarai and 6 of them received additional capital of Rp10 million each in soft loans from the Cooperatives and SME Office, Kabupaten Manggarai
The plan is that one LPD/K will be formed in each kecamatan as a model institution, and it is hoped that one LDP/K will be established in each village/kelurahan in the future
To date, LPD/K services are still limited in scope due to a lack of funds
The Pasir Putih LPK in Kelurahan Wae Belang and the Kotandora LPK in Kecamatan Borong, for example, have only provided credit for 31 and 50 households respectively
These loans have only been provided to members
To become a member of the Pasir Putih LPD, individuals must deposit principal savings of Rp30,000 and compulsory savings of Rp5,000 as well as make a monthly arisan contribution of Rp5,000
In the credit scheme developed by this LPD, loans are between Rp100,000 and Rp1 million with a loan term of 10-15 months and an effective interest rate of 1.5-2% per month
The future prospect of LPD/K is, however, unknown because the funds that are supposed to be pulled together by this institution as an initial capital, which is IDT and UED-SP funds, are very unlikely to be collected from the communities due to lack of records and the community attitude that they do not have to return the funds
There is also a tendency for sectoral offices to retain their authorities over their programmable funds
The NTAADP executing agency, for example, does not agree to the formation of LPD/K and prefers to increase the capacity of the existing UPKD
In an effort to strengthen the existing UPKDs, Bappeda has hired a financial consultant who works intensively to improve UPKDs administration performance
3.3.3 Microfinance Services Provided by NTAADP and KDP
Besides microfinance services developed by local governments, there are two big programs with microfinance components supported by donor agencies in NTT
Nusa Tenggara Agricultural Area Development Project (NTAADP) and Kecamatan Development Program (KDP)
NTAADP was funded by the World Bank between 1999 and 2003
In NTT, this program was conducted in eight kabupaten, 28 kecamatan, and 263 villages
In 2002, 5,115 community groups, including 48,151 individuals (21% of them were women), received assistance
In Kabupaten Manggarai, NTAADP was conducted in Kecamatan Satarmese that covers 25 villages and utilized funding of Rp3.2 billion
One of these villages, Desa Bea Kondo, received NTAADP funds twice, Rp79 million in 2000 and Rp20 million in 2001
KDP is a program that is managed by the government through the Directorate General for the Development of Village Communities (Ministry of Home Affairs), in collaboration with the World Bank, several government offices, BRI, universities, regional governments and NGOs
The funds channelled to each kecamatan ranges between Rp350 million and Rp1 billion depending upon the number of residents
Most of the funds are used to develop infrastructure in accordance with the community's request, but some of the funds are also used for supporting economically productive activities and revolving funds
In relation to revolving funds, these two government programs funded by donors have similar objectives, namely to increase the income of poor rural families
NTAADP placed greater emphasis on productive agribusiness activities, whereas KDP provides access to credit for the poor in order to develop their economic enterprises (see Box 3.12.)
NTAADP's working area only covered Nusa Tenggara and the program's targets were poor rural families, whereas KDP covers the whole of Indonesia and its targets are the kecamatan where a large proportion of residents are poor
Although these programs basically have the same targets, it is apparent that they have had different levels of success in reaching these targets in the field
In the sample regions, it is apparent that NTAADP was able to embrace the poor as beneficiaries, whereas KDP has not been that successful in reaching poor families as communities believed that quite a few rich families had been recipients of KDP funds
The performance of loans provided by NTAADP and KDP could be observed from several aspects such as program beneficiaries, credit repayment rate and the sustainability of revolving funds
In relation to the beneficiaries of credit assistance, most of the NTAADP beneficiaries are poor farmers, whereas KDP beneficiaries are mixed, including poor families and rich families
In respect to credit repayments for the NTAADP program, 58% of loans as per May 2004 were outstanding
In fact, in Desa Bea Kondo, of the Rp91 million channelled into the village, 92% was outstanding
These outstanding loans almost caused the local UPKD activities to stop
This also occurred with the KDP program
Outstanding loans in the KDP program vary according to region and business sector
The repayment rate for loans provided to residents who live in areas close to urban areas is higher compared to that for residents who live in the interior
In general, the repayment rate for loans provided to stall owners is higher than that for animal husbandry businesses
In the animal husbandry sector, the repayment rate for loans to cattle producers is higher than that for pig farmers
The sustainability of revolving funds, both for the NTAADP and KDP programs, depends upon the loan repayment rate
In the areas and sectors where the loan repayment rate is high, funds circulate more quickly between borrowers and from one group to another
Complaints often arise however, because businesses become bankrupt due to a lack of capital after repaying loans
In relation to this, program managers not only need to pay attention to the amount of credit provided, but also to how long a group or individual should continue to receive credit, for example, whether they should receive credit until they are able to sustain their business
3.4 Services Provided by Informal Institutions
Poor families in NTT also obtain loans from informal institutions such as informal moneylenders (loan shark), arisan groups and loan and saving groups
There are more services offered by informal moneylenders in Kabupaten Kupang than in Kabupaten Manggarai
This is, to some extent, related to the level of difficulty of life for the poor in Kabupaten Kupang, which is relatively greater than that of the poor in Kabupaten Manggarai
Arisan groups were found in both sample kabupaten, but there were more in Kabupaten Manggarai and the type of activities were more varied
The establishment of a large number of arisan groups in Kabupaten Manggarai is perhaps due to the lack of microfinance services offered in the region compared to Kabupaten Kupang that is located close to a center for economic and governance activities
3.4.1 Informal Moneylenders
With the spread of microfinance services offered by formal and non-formal institutions and particularly government assistance programs, services offered by moneylenders in NTT have decreased significantly
It is however, recognized that the informal moneylenders still exist in many places out of the sample regions (see Box 3.13.)
Informal money lending services are still offered here and there, particularly because it is an inexpensive and quick process
If someone needs emergency loans, there are two types of informal money lending services
Firstly, individuals who borrow money from neighbors or relatives; and secondly, lending institutions that are referred to as daily bank (as has been discussed in Section 3.1.2.2.3)
Borrowing from neighbors and relatives is less common than borrowing from daily banks, because rarely are there neighbors or relatives who have excess money that they do not need
In general, individuals referred to as rentenir (moneylenders) who provide high-interest loans hardly exist, but their role has been taken over by the daily banks which charge interest rate as high as 20% per month
3.4.2 Arisan and Loan-Saving Groups
Arisan activities have been developed in society because they provide savings and loans for everyone, including the poor
Becoming a member of an arisan group means forcing oneself to save money that at some point will be used to meet a variety of productive and consumption needs
In areas where financial services are still limited such as in Kabupaten Manggarai, there are many arisan activities that have been developed to fulfil various needs, such as housing, food security, and other household expenses
Commonly, an arisan group is formed by and for the membership of 10-25 people, although some have more than 40 members
Several arisan groups developed their activities towards loan and saving group
Besides paying for rotary saving (arisan) the members also agree to have compulsory and voluntary savings
The money collected then could be loaned to other members of the group with schemes of saving and lending determined by the consensus between them
This group is usually not permanent and will be wound up after one round of rotary saving or after one completed year
They usually continue with another round however, after one round is completed, although the membership can change depending on the willingness of the members
Several groups received assistance and motivation from local NGOs and evolved as UBSP or even as loan and saving cooperative
Nevertheless, the development and the sustainability of such groups depends primarily on the leaders of the group and the trust between the members of the group
In one case found during this study, a group that had run quite well was ruined after receiving a loan from one credit program because the members were not confident with the management of this loan
3.5 The Roles of Donor Agencies
The provision of microfinance services has received direct and indirect support from various donor agencies
Direct support is given in the form of providing funds to be channelled to the community through government, such as NTAADP and KDP that have received funding from the World Bank, or cashew nut intensification program in Manggarai that received funding from IFAD
Other donor agencies provided funding and channelled it through existing MFIs, both cooperatives such as Puskud that get funding from NCBA and other nonformal MFI such as TLM, YAO, UBSP Tunas Jaya
Other forms of support are technical assistance and training to strengthening MFIs
Both training and technical assistance could be performed directly by the donor agency or indirectly through other professional organizations or big NGOs
In addition, several donor agencies also assist capacity building through the Central Bank and through facilitating the links between MFIs and banks
Several activities of donor agencies that are related directly and indirectly with the provision of microfinance services in NTT are as follows
The World Bank has funded NTAADP and KDP programs that cover some regions in NTT
NTAADP has been completed in 2003, but there was information within the local government offices that the program is likely to be continued by a program focusing more on strengthening the capacity of existing UPKD
KDP, including the components for supporting economically productive activities and revolving funds are still running in several locations
Swiss Contact is in principle focusing on developing the economy of the region through establishing a center for medium and small-scale business development that will link local business to outside markets as well as financial institutions
For NTT in particular, Swiss Contact has not established programs that have been developed in other regions since they considered that the activities of medium and small-scale business in NTT are still limited
Nowadays, Swiss Contact activities in NTT are focusing only on the marketing of cashew nut by facilitating contact between the traders and the farmers, and a pilot project for developing organic cashew nut
At this stage, the assistance is provided in the form of technical assistance and facilitation to increase direct access to exporters, with no additional capital since the farmers do not need special working capital
In the next stage, it is hoped that the farmers can do the processing of the cashew nut and this will be supported by a financial scheme to purchase simple processing machines
AusAID has provided support to microfinance in NTT through three programs, which are
1) Small Activities Scheme (SAS), 2) Program for strengthening MFIs, and 3) Access Program
SAS provides funds for NGOs that had been selected based on proposals submitted by the participating NGOs
Some NGOs channelled the funds to the community through microcredit, both in the forms of revolving funds or cattle
This program had been completed in 2002 and there was no follow up monitoring after the program had ended
The program for strengthening MFIs was done based on AusAID's commitment in the Microfinance Summit 2001 and it was provided through capacity building program
The program started in 2002 and targeted MFIs that provide microfinance services for the poor
In NTT, this program was carried out by Opportunity International, which assisted the institutional development of TLM so that this MFI could be financially viable and sustainable in the long run and open two new branches
In addition, AusAID also funded Access program with an objective of building the capacity of local NGOs
One of the activities in this program is Community Lead Assessment Processes (CLAP) where NGOs exercise their planning process through the involvement of local communities
Based on CLAP results, there are some requests for microfinance services to be provided by the NGO and local communities
NZAID has developed a program called Social Community Development Fund (SCDF) with the objective of empowering communities through NGOs
In its implementation, NZAID collaborated with
1) Facility NGOs (FNGOs), which are NGOs that channel funds and provide training to local NGOs called Participatory NGOs (PNGOs); 2) PNGOs, which are local NGOs that channel funds and provide direct assistance to community based organizations (CBOs), following a procedures set based on consensus between the PNGOs and the donor agency; 3) CBOs, which are organizations established by the community who received funds from donor agencies through PNGOs
At the community level or CBO, the funds are given as a revolving fund with joint responsibility among CBO members
One of the FNGOs is Yayasan Alfa Omega (YAO) that carried out a daily system of "Credit Union" in Kabupaten Kupang
Besides providing funds, NZAID also provides funds for capacity building and audit facilities for both financial as well as program audits
Japan, through Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), carried out at least three projects in NTT, namely
1) Promotion of Improved and Sustainable Community Development Program Method by Multi-sector Approach through Level NGO in East Nusa Tenggara (in collaboration with YAO), 2) Women Empowerment through the development and establishment of Small Industry in East Nusa Tenggara (in collaboration with Womintra), and 3) Community Empowerment Program (CEP)
CEP is directly related to the provision of microfinance, and the objective of this project is to improve the welfare level of the communities at the grass root level
Through this program, JICA provides funds and training for NGOs
One of the NGOs that are participating in this project is the Foundation for the Development of Marine and Coastal Communities (YPPL)
GTZ through its Promis NT program has developed links between banks and community groups (PHBK) in collaboration with local governments
The PHBK program is currently focusing on West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) Province because the activities of banks, BPRs and community groups are more abundant
In NTT, this activity has been initiated only in Kabupaten Alor
In addition to the donor agencies mentioned above, NGOs in NTT also receive assistance from other donor agencies from Europe, such as AYO Indonesia Foundation in Kabupaten Manggarai that received capital assistance from Fado/Veco Indonesia (Belgium), Misereor (Germany), ICRAF, VSO, Neem, particularly for the Sustainable Agriculture Program
This initiative does not directly relate to the provision of microfinance services but more to the promotion of a sustainable way of agricultural activities through training at the village level
However, the training and technical assistance also includes the use of local resources, strengthening community institutions and economically productive activities
In general, several program managers based in Jakarta raised some issues of concern regarding the implementation of their programs
These are related to the weaknesses of the NGOs participating in the programs as well as the weaknesses of the communities as program beneficiaries
The weakness of the participating NGOs is usually regarding their limited capability in reporting using good language and presenting clear ideas
For donor agencies, good quality reporting is essential for keeping track of the program and to evaluate the performance of the program's implementers
At the community level, the problem is commonly due to the low level of willingness and awareness of the people (the poor) to participate in group activities, and a lack of discipline in following the necessary steps of a program as well as the poor educational standard of human resources
IV MICROFINANCE IN THE LIVES OF THE POOR IN NTT
The interviews with respondents in the sample villages highlight the diversity in the livelihoods of the poor
These differences influence their access to, choice of, and need for microfinance services
To understand the links between the poor's livelihoods, the services available and the poor's need for microfinance services, this chapter provides an illustration of the lives of the poor in the sample areas, as well as their views of, and experiences with, microfinance services
4.1 A Profile of the Sample Villages
The four villages selected as samples for this study (Kelurahan Oesao and Desa Ponain in Kabupaten Kupang, and Kelurahan Wae Belang and Desa Golo Kantar in Kabupaten Manggarai) have different characteristics
Kelurahan Oesao in Kecamatan Kupang Timur is around 25km to the east of Kota Kupang
This kelurahan is semi-urban in nature with highly progressing economic activities as it is the location of the Oesao Market as the gateway and center for the trade in produce, particularly vegetables from the surrounding areas and Kabupaten Timor Tengah Utara
The population of this kelurahan was 4,914 in 2002 (BPS Kupang, Kupang Timur in Figures)
A large proportion of the population makes a living from the agricultural sector, but the Oesao market also provides opportunities for other businesses, particularly trading businesses and home industries such as sewing or baking businesses and working as an ironmonger
A variety of formal and non-formal microfinance services as well as government programs exist in this kelurahan
The formal microfinance institutions (MFIs) located in this kelurahan include BRI rural branches, pawnshop branches and the Oesao branch of Bank NTT which opened in July 2004
In addition, there are also non-banking and non-formal MFIs which are managed by non-government organizations (NGOs) (see Table 4.1)
Desa Ponain in Kecamatan Amarasi is located around 45km to the northeast of Kota Kupang
The majority of the population earns a living from agricultural and animal husbandry businesses, particularly cattle production
Almost all of the residents, 435 families in total with 1,780 individuals in 2002 (BPS Kupang, Amarasi in Figures), own farm land which they use to produce food or plantation crops
Several households run micro-businesses producing coconut oil
This village is a beef-producing village and almost every family plants fodder crops in their yard
There are no formal or non-formal MFI establishments located in this village, and so the community generally accesses the microfinance institutions in Kelurahan Oesao or Kota Kupang
The largest community income-generating program in this village is a profit-sharing cow production program managed by Puskud
Other than this, there is also an informal institution in the form of a community group that provides credit to members
Kelurahan Wae Belung in Kecamatan Ruteng is around 35km to the east of the capital of Kabupaten Manggarai
There were 538 families with 2,910 people in 2001 (BPS Manggarai, Kecamatan Ruteng in Figures)
Although it is a semi-urban area, businesses are not as busy as those in Kelurahan Oesao
The majority of the population (75%) earns a living in the agricultural sector, particularly rice farming and dry fields or plantations which are used to plant coffee, cloves and a bit of vanilla, around 15% are civil servants and the remaining 10% work outside the agricultural sector, such as kiosk owners, batako producers, sand quarrying laborers and building laborers
Desa Golo Kantar in Kecamatan Borong, a rural village that is located around 70 km to the south-east of the kabupaten capital
In 2001, there were 467 families with 2,397 people in this village (BPS Manggarai, Kecamatan Borong in Figures)
The majority of the residents work in the agricultural sector, mainly in dry fields and plantations that are predominantly used to produce cashew nuts, kapok, bananas and cloves
Besides this, there are around 30 hectares of wet rice fields located near flood plains
Widespread planting of cashew nut trees began in 1994/5 with assistance from IFAD
Almost all farmers who owned dry fields received seedlings and pesticides/insecticides on credit during the project period, that is between 1994/5 and 2000
There are not as many formal and non-formal microfinance institutions in Kelurahan Wae Belang and Desa Golo Kantar as in Kelurahan Oesao
There is only a BRI rural branch in Kelurahan Wae Belang
For Desa Golo Kantar however, the closest BRI are in the kecamatan capital, which is around 7 km from the village
Other banking institutions are in the kabupaten capital
There are no non-formal microfinance institutions in Kelurahan Wae Belang or Desa Golo Kantar, but there are a lot of arisan groups as well as savings and loans groups that are managed by the communities themselves
In Kelurahan Wae Belang, there are more than ten arisan/savings and loans groups, whereas there are around 30 of these groups in Desa Golo Kantar
4.2 The Community Livelihood in the Sample Villages
The agricultural sector is still the main source of income for the majority of residents in the sample areas, although trading businesses and home industries have developed in several areas, particularly those near urban areas
The growth of agricultural and non-agricultural businesses still faces obstacles because of the dry climate, lack of command of new technology, poor infrastructure and limited access to markets, as well as unfavorable social conditions (see Box 4.1)
The availability of water and land fertility very much determines a community's level of prosperity
Desa Oesao, for example, became more prosperous after it received assistance to dig wells in 1974
The water supply allows farmers to plant vegetables in fields that had previously been left untilled or had only been used to plant corn once a year
Most of the farmers in the sample areas own farm land, but not all of it is farmed
The reasons include a lack of labor to clear the land, remote and difficult-toreach locations, lack of capital to purchase seeds and seedlings as well as other production equipment, and lack of water
Because of the dry climate, farmers generally use intercropping as a means of dealing with the uncertain seasons, for example with corn, dry field rice and cassava
By farming in such a way, it is hoped that if one crop fails, there will still be other productive plants
Farmers only plant rice and vegetables in certain locations where there is enough water
Food crops in dry fields can only be harvested once a year and often fail
Most of the corn and unshelled rice is stored for household consumption, except in wet-rice farming communities that own large amounts of land in rice-producing centers, such as in some locations in Manggarai or in East Kupang
In other areas, the rice harvested is rarely enough to meet the needs of a family until the following harvest
They must purchase staple foods using the profits they earn through selling plantation produce or pigs and chickens
In a dry land farming system, plantation crops and livestock are an important source of income for families
In addition to purchasing food, earnings from the sale of plantation produce are usually used to pay for other household needs and long-term investments, such as education and houses, as well as adat expenses
Cattle, buffalo, and pig farming are a strategic way of saving money
If there is a surplus income from agricultural businesses, it is generally used to purchase cows and pigs
In addition to unexpected needs or education expenses, cows and pigs are also raised for adat needs
Trading businesses and home industries such as batako makers, coconut oil producers, carpenters, ironmongers and bakers, have begun to grow in semi-urban areas
These businesses are generally small or even microbusinesses
Growth of these businesses is generally hampered by limited capabilities and business alternatives as well as limited markets
To add to their income, many families open kiosks at the front of their houses
It is difficult though for these kiosks to grow as an increasing number of households are opening kiosks, whereas consumption is still limited
It is difficult for the majority of small industries to grow because they only serve local markets where there is limited demand, and the skills and capital of business owners are also limited (see box 4.2)
The communities in the sample villages, as with communities in general in NTT, still adhere to several adat customs and systems in their social lives
The adat systems relating to the management of family finances are apparent in weddings and funerals
These two affairs are the joint responsibility of the extended family and are usually very expensive
In Kabupaten Manggarai, for example, if a family is stricken by the death of a family member or marries off a son, the nuclear family, daughters and female relatives who are married are obliged to cover the expenses; an obligation which is referred to as sida
If a daughter marries, her family, including her brothers, will receive a part of the belis (bride price) sent by the groom's family
There are two different perspectives of this system of paying for adat needs
The positive side of the system is that it strengthens kinship ties and social relations
It is also a form of social insurance or savings to cover the rites of one's lifecycle, and thus can help family to pay for wedding celebrations or funerals
The negative side of this system materialized when the amount of a belis or size of a contribution is often used to measure a family's prestige, and thus there is a tendency to contribute more than one is capable of contributing and celebrations are also of a large scale
The obligation to pay a large belis or sida tends to result in communities guarding their savings, usually in the form of livestock, and being reluctant to use their savings to increase business capital or make long-term investments
There have also been cases where individuals have used business capital or credit for adat needs, and thus their businesses contracted or even went bankrupt (Box 4.3)
4.3 Using Microfinance Services
4.3.1 Formal Microfinance Institutions - Banks
The banks that were most often accessed by respondents were the BRI rural branches located around kecamatan capitals
Besides these banks, people also used other banking services such as Bank NTT, Bank BNI, Bank Mandiri and post offices
In Manggarai, communities also used the services offered by the BPR, that is BPR Lugas Ganda, the only BPR that operates in the sample area
These banks provide credit, savings and transfer services
Of these three forms of services, the type most frequently used by respondents was savings services
Although the majority of respondents who had a bank account stated that their balance was low or that their account was not very active
The small amount of money they have to save and the distance between their houses and the closest bank, usually a BRI rural branch, are the main factors impeding the increase in savings
One respondent who worked as a cigarette seller, for example, revealed that he chose to save his money at the post office because he does not save very much money and the notes he banks are dirty and crumpled, thus making him too embarrassed to save at a bank
In addition to individuals, several arisan groups or savings and loans groups found in Kabupaten Manggarai also saved their cash at a bank, usually at a BRI rural branch
Most of the respondents who received credit from banks were civil servants
The poor's access to loans provided by banks is limited by an absence of adequate collateral, which is the main condition of obtaining commercial loans
Despite having collateral, banks often ask poor families to attach a copy of their business permit and a letter from a government official (village head/lurah, or camat)
It takes a lot of time and money to organize and obtain all of these documents
One respondent, for example, stated that he had to pay Rp50,000 to obtain a letter from the camat certifying his identity, or 1.7% of the Rp3 million loans he was requesting
In one of the sample villages, a respondent said that the terms and conditions of obtaining loans from a bank included other irrelevant requirements, such as having paid their land and building tax and made repayments for the corn seeds they received through the Arjuna program as well as having a KUD member card
Banking institutions generally do not want to provide loans to be used as initial capital, and instead only provide loans for businesses which are already operating
This certainly benefits the individuals who already own businesses and disadvantages those who do not own a business but wish to start one
Banks regard business activities outside the agricultural sector as their main targets
Businesses in the agricultural sector are considered to have very low credit ratings, and thus it is very difficult for farmers to obtain loans for cultivation activities
The loan amount agreed to by a bank is generally lower than the amount requested by the potential borrower
Before applying for a loan however, potential borrowers calculate their real capital needs first
In the end, loan money is not used in accordance with the request
The loan terms and conditions set by BPRs are somewhat easier than that set by commercial banks
Several respondents who were BPR customers revealed that the BPR only require a letter from the village head certifying that an individual owns land, a photocopy of their identity card and family card, as well as a passport photo of the individual and their spouse
BPR employees go to a borrower's house so that they do not have to apply for credit or make repayments at the BPR branch, which is in the kabupaten capital
The interest rate is, however, much higher than the interest rate at BRI
Because of these various impediments, the poor's access to microcredits provided by banks is very limited
Out of the 58 respondents that could be categorized as poor families, only 6 had ever received loans from banks
The use of money obtained from banks varied amongst respondents
Most of the respondents who were civil servants obtained loans to build or renovate their houses, pay their children's school fees, pay for medical treatment when a family member falls sick, buy motorcycles, and some even saved it for unexpected needs, including paying belis or sida
Only a few of them use a portion of their loans to buy livestock or increase the capital of their agricultural or trading businesses
Most of the bank customers who were not civil servants use loans to increase business capital, although a number of them also use them for other purposes
The use of transfers is very limited
Most of the respondents who frequently used transfer services provided by banks and the post office were those families whose children went to school in a different region, and in general they were not classified as poor
Other than these families, several families that have relatives who work in other regions or as migrant laborers, occasionally used transfer services
Transfers are usually organized through a bank or post office in the kecamatan or kabupaten capital
Although banks are a significant distance away, those who use transfer services generally do not complain about the distance they have to travel because they rarely transfer money
4.3.2 Formal Microfinance Institutions - Non-banks
Pawnshops are one type of non-banking formal MFI that are attractive for borrowers
Pawnshop customers generally feel that the payment system that allows customers to extend the loan term simply by paying the interest on the due date is very helpful, because they rarely have a fixed income
In addition to the flexible payment system, pawnshops do not determine what loans should be used for
Customers can borrow small amounts of money for everyday consumption purposes or larger amounts to increase business capital
Nevertheless, pawnshop services are very limited because there are few branches and transport costs for the poor who live in remote areas to cities are too expensive
Cooperatives are another type of formal MFIs
The study's respondents knew of and used four types of cooperatives, that is
cooperatives established by farmers' groups that only serve members; cooperatives founded by non-government institutions that provide savings and loans services; cooperatives that only provide small-scale loans and cooperatives that work together with farmers through profit-sharing activities
The Nusa Hijau Lestari Cooperative (NHL) in Kelurahan Oesao, Kecamatan Kupang Timur which was established by the farmers' group of the same name, only assists its 25 members in accessing loans for agricultural businesses from BRI and channels loans from the Cooperatives Office
The members feel that the loans are very useful because payments are adapted to the income cycle of their agricultural businesses
Despite this, they still feel that the amount loaned is too small and unreliable, because it depends upon external funding
Although members deposit compulsory and voluntary savings, this cooperative does not emphasize savings services for members
Unfortunately, not many of these cooperatives are still active
In Kecamatan Kupang Timur, there are only two such cooperatives that are still active
The KUD which previously channeled KUT to quite a few farmers, is no longer in operation due to bad debts and poor management
In Kecamatan Borong, the KUD is still quite active, but only two or three people in Desa Golo Kantar are members
Cooperatives that provide savings and loans services, such as Talenta, or those that only provide small-scale loans, such as Puskopabri or Kopabri, are the institutions most commonly used by the lower to middle classes
Although the interest rates set by these cooperatives are quite high (5%-7% per month for Talenta and 20% per month for Puskopabri), many of the poor take these loans because the procedures and the requirements are very easy
Talenta requires borrowers to become members and one-sixth of their loans are deducted to form a savings account
Puskopabri, a well-known daily bank, also deducted 5% of loans to deposit as savings, although customers are not allowed to add to their savings
Savings at these cooperatives can only be withdrawn after a borrower has settled his/her loan or is no longer a member of the cooperative
Loans are handed over to individuals and cooperative staff go from house to house collecting money for repayments
Respondents stated that most smallscale loans were used for daily necessities or for trading businesses that make a profit on a daily basis
These loan schemes are thought to be disadvantageous and inappropriate for families whose incomes depend upon agricultural businesses
Although many poor people take the loans provided by this type of cooperatives, the customers complain about the very short loan terms, daily or weekly repayment system, and very high interest rates
The respondents who take the loans with very high interest rates (20% per month) stated that this scheme is actually detrimental to their financial condition
They felt obliged however, to take this loan because they need money and they do not have access to other sources
This phenomenon is ironic
The number of poor in both urban and rural areas who have the potential to improve their welfare level is limited
They have very limited access to loans provided by banks so that they are prone to be trapped by the very high interest loans provided by other MFIs and loan sharks
According to a poverty expert in NTT, in addition to the scarcity of loans from banks, the poor usually have limited capacity to assess risk
They tend to think of only the short-term consequences and let fortune decide their future
Thus, if they have the opportunity to get loans, even with a very high interest rate, they would be likely to take it
Another cooperative, Puskud, has developed cattle production businesses that use a profitsharing system in Desa Ponain, Kecamatan Amarasi
This initiative adopts a system of cooperation with farmers who are provided with capital in the form of calves to the value of Rp1.5 million
Participants really like how this program is organized
According to a number of respondents however, at least five or six cows are required to meet a family's expenditure, which can reach Rp500,000 per month
The program beneficiaries generally like this program due to the following reasons
Cows are purchased on the basis of an agreement between cattle producers and Puskud staff
The price of a young cow is around Rp1.5 million per head
They sold the cattle openly at a sale attended by cattle farmers, Puskud staff and cattle traders
If Puskud's bidding price is below that of the cattle trader, the cow is sold to the trader
Seventy percent of the profits from the sale, after expenses are deducted (price of the cow, medication, ropes, and village tax), goes to the cattle farmer and 30% go to Puskud
A cattle producer can earn between Rp500,000 and Rp1 million per head of cattle
Puskud provides a veterinarian on a routine basis to examine the cattle
Besides this, Puskud assigns an assistant to live in a village in order to help and supervise the cattle producers
Usually, the assistant checks on every group once a week
For their fieldwork, assistants receive a motorcycle and money to cover operational costs
In addition to receiving a wage, they also receive a bonus if they reach Puskud's target
The program is considered to be highly beneficial because there is intensive assistance, a reliable market and a fairer system that spreads the risk of business failure
The division of cows and determination of selling prices are also considered to be very open
Several respondents stated that the profits they receive from this profit-sharing system are much higher than those from profit-sharing systems usually established with other businesses or individuals
4.3.3 Non-formal Institutions
Of the variety of microfinance services managed by NGOs, respondents were members of two institutions, TLM and YAO
Although they use different systems, the microfinance services offered by these two institutions appear to reach the poor 
Although the majority of borrowers already own businesses
TLM has attempted to reach the poor by providing limited loans for groups of 4-5 people, but it seems that this system is not yet operating as well as it should
TLM customers met in the field revealed that the groups did not operate effectively
Several group members signed the agreement, whereas loans were only used by some of group members
This was due to the fact that the allocations per person (Rp500,000) were too small
As a result, only two or three members from the group would use the loan, although this was done with the agreement of other members
The loans received are used for a variety of purposes, not just to increase business capital
Most customers obtained small-scale loans on a continual basis
After settling the first loan, customers take out another loan of the same amount or of a larger amount
Many customers, however, are unwilling to increase the amount of money they receive as they are worried they will not be able to make the repayments
It appears that there is a tendency for the first loan to be used to increase business capital, but further loans are often used for long-term investments such as building a house, paying children's school fees, improving the condition of a kiosk or even for savings
Although loans are somewhat useful, several customers complained about the small amounts of money loaned and weekly instalments that are burdensome because the capital has not yet had time to revolve
It can be said that in general customers feel that the finance schemes they have access to do not actually suit their needs
As is the case with Talenta and Puskopabri, the customers of these non-formal MFIs take up this loan primarily because they do not have access to other services that are considered to be more suitable to their needs
Besides this, it appears that there is a lack of business assistance, and thus there have not been any improvements in business management that could result in business owners becoming more capable of accessing capital from banking institutions
4.3.4 Government Microfinance Programs
Money channeled by the government through sectoral government offices to communities is generally provided
directly to individuals or groups in communities in the form of loans or credit from government offices; through the existing formal or non-formal groups; or in the form of money to communities along with the establishment of financial management institutions
One type of credit program was the cashew nut development program in Desa Golo Kantar, which was funded by IFAD and managed by the Plantation Office
Although the profits from this program could only be enjoyed after several years, the program was fairly successful in helping communities increase their incomes
Almost all village residents received seedlings, pesticides and insecticides on credit although not all of them were successful
Several farmers were successful and could even extend their land using the earnings from the cashew nut harvest
In several areas however, the trees died because of drought, disease or infertile soil
Complaints voiced by unsuccessful farmers were the lack of assistance and the absence of assistance if the trees were infected by disease, as they did not understand cultivation methods for cashew nut trees
Repayments by farmers varied
Some repaid the loans despite the trees not yet being productive but others did not make repayments because their plantations were not very productive
Farmers who have repaid their loans generally made payments using the sales profits from other plantations
The arisan and savings and loans groups stimulated by this program are still operating and a number of them have indicated that there has been an increase in the groups' assets
Loans originating from IFAD's stimulation funds, member savings and interest rates were determined on the basis of agreements within each group
Loans could be used for daily necessities, education for children or to increase agricultural business capital
Purchasing cows or pigs on credit from the Animal Husbandry Office is repaid in the form of calves and piglets
Individuals can also purchase chickens on credit
In general, these programs have very few beneficiaries
As with the cashew program described above, several respondents who have participated in these programs also complained about the lack of business assistance
Another problem faced by beneficiaries was the lack of clarity about the division of risk in the case of natural disasters or disease
In several cases, beneficiaries still had to make repayments despite their livestock or chickens having died, and this meant that they had to pay using money from other businesses
Finance in the form of loans provided directly to individuals, especially that from the Cooperatives and SMEs Office, is aimed at small businesses
One of the respondents who received a loan was a businessperson who owned a meatball stall and a kiosk which sold everyday items and petrol
Compared with other residents in the village, this respondent was classified as quite well off
Other finance programs that aim at developing small businesses are UP2K and KUKU, and the respondents who received loans from these programs were not classified as poor
Loans received by these respondents are used to increase business capital and are considered to be beneficial because the interest rates are low
Small-scale loans provided to the poor are generally provided through groups, both existing groups as well as groups formed especially for finance reasons
Respondents were very interested in program credit because of the simple procedures; generally individuals only have to form groups
Besides this, the highest interest rate is equal to interest rates at commercial banks, and many types of programs actually charge lower interest rates or no interest at all
Quite a few communities consider program credit as having few risks as reflected in experiences from the previous programs
The reasons for this behavior could be traced back to the low law enforcement in the past when the creditors received no punishment for not repaying credits or loans
Although poor families are very interested in loans funded by assistance programs, there are very few beneficiaries
In addition, there is a tendency for groups that have already received assistance and are capable of making repayments to become targets of other programs
Of the respondents met in the field, a number of them who are classified as relatively poor had received loans, but the poorest of the poor had not
Besides the limited number of beneficiaries, this type of credit is not always available
Sustainability is also a serious obstacle for poor families currently receiving this type of credit
There is no guarantee that they will receive assistance in the future because experience so far has shown that program credit provision patterns are ad hoc
Poverty reduction in NTT needs to be continuous and have clear targets, and thus if the problems described above continue to occur, such program credit provision patterns will be less than effective
It seems that the government programs that have been accompanied by the establishment of financial management institutions have not yet been able to provide loans on an ongoing basis
Savings and loans programs in the KDP program, for example, have not been able to provide loans on a continual basis
A respondent in one of the sample villages who had settled his debts was unable to obtain another loan because the other groups had not been able to repay their loans
There were also complaints that the administrative requirements for KDP loans were becoming increasingly complex and the repayments were not established in line with business or agricultural earning patterns
UPKDs formed under the IMS-NTAADP program do not yet function as financial institutions because of management's failure to run the UPKDs well and poor administrative capabilities
It appears the LPDs that are being testrun in Manggarai are still going to experience problems
Stimulation funds provided to the UBSP selected as the initial LPD in the sample villages, for example, were actually only provided to a few managers who were not too poor by the community's standards
Loans from this LPD are preferred over credit from BRI because of the lenient terms and conditions, low interest rate and 0.5% goes to the UBSP
However, if the ways of channeling credit are not improved, those who are better off will only enjoy this type of finance
4.3.5 Informal Institutions
In addition to borrowing from daily bank, a few individuals also borrow relatively small amounts of money from neighbors or relatives to meet unexpected needs
Individuals can obtain loans as long as they are known to be of a good character
The motivation to assist others is quite apparent in the borrowing process
The loan provider does not charge interest if the borrower can settle the loan in less than a month
In several cases, borrowers who were unable to settle their debt have paid by working as a waged laborer for the person who provided the loan
It was discovered in Kabupaten Manggarai that individuals borrow from neighbors and relatives to cover rice-farming costs
Loans are repaid using rice after the harvest
The longer the money is borrowed before the harvest, the lower the price of the rice that will be used to repay the loan
For example, if the price of rice at harvest time is Rp1,000/kg, loans obtained during the planting stage are repaid with rice valued at Rp650/kg, loans obtained during the weeding stage are repaid with rice valued at Rp800/kg, and loans obtained towards the harvest are repaid with rice valued at Rp900/kg
In the villages included in the research sample in Kabupaten Manggarai, the majority of respondents were members of one or more arisan groups
They are familiar with a variety of forms of arisan, not only those that save money but also those that accumulate goods
Individuals who want to build or renovate a house, for example, form cement, brick or corrugated iron arisan groups
In the last five years, houses in one of the sample villages have been built or renovated by their owners with the support of arisan groups
The growth of these arisan groups indicates that microfinance services provided by formal and non-formal MFIs in the sample regions has not reached the majority of population, particularly the poor
Several arisan groups have expanded their activities to include savings and loans activities
Group members are not only required to make arisan contributions but also deposit money
Savings of the same amount for each member must be deposited at the same time as arisan contributions are made
Members can borrow money that has been collected through deposits to a monthly interest rate of 5%
Members agree to this high interest rate in order to cover inflation and because ultimately the money collected in interest will be divided equally between group members
Savings and loans activities through arisan groups do not just come in the form of money but also rice
At each harvest, group members hand over an equal amount of rice to the group's manager
Unlike money that is only loaned to group members, rice can be loaned to anybody, such as neighbors
During the dry season, usually towards the planting season, many residents require rice to meet their food needs
Loaned rice is returned after the harvest with an additional amount, or a type of interest, that is around 5-10% of the amount loaned
Another variation that has developed in communities is what they refer to as a progressive arisan
Considering that the value of the rupiah continually decreases, group members make a larger contribution each month
For example, a contribution of Rp25,000 in the first month would become Rp26,000 in the second month, Rp27,000 in the third month and so forth
This way, those who win the arisan later on do not lose out due to a decrease in the value of the rupiah
4.4 The Poor's Demand for Microfinance
Based on the field findings, it can be concluded that the poor, that is those included in the low income classes in NTT, also require microfinance services in amounts and forms that suit their livelihood patterns
Their need for microfinance services can be grouped into real needs, that are the needs which have already been met, and potential needs
Potential needs include the mismatch between the services provided and the real demand, and the demand that is yet to emerge due to restricting factors, such as infrastructure, technology and markets for produce
Based on this categorization, the poor's need for different forms of microfinance services are as follows
Credit Needs Based on the access to, and the demand for, microcredits, the respondents of this study who are considered poor can be grouped into three categories
1) the poor who express no demand for credits; 2) the poor who have not received any credits or loans but express an interest in obtaining them; 3) the poor who have received credits or loans
Around 25% of the poor respondents have expressed no demand for loans because they do not have fixed incomes and they are afraid that they would not be able to repay the loans
The majority of the poor, however, articulate their interest in obtaining loans
For those who do not have access to loans, the reasons for not taking up loans are
a. the MFIs, particularly banks, that provide loans with low interest rates, require collateral that is impossible for them to fulfill
b. other MFIs that apply simple procedures and requirements, which can be met easily by them, such as Puskopabri and non-formal MFIs charge high interest rates and have short loan periods
In addition to the heavy financial burden of high interest rates, the daily or weekly repayment schedule is incompatible with their income earning cycles
On the other hand, almost all poor households that have had access to loans, both from formal and non-formal MFIs, stated that the loans that they get do not really fit with their real demand
Nevertheless, they take up the loan because there are no other sources available
This indicates that there is quite a significant gap between the poor's demand for credits and loans that suit their livelihood pattern
Another indication of the large gap can be seen from the loans and credits proposals that have not been accepted by various NGOs that provide microfinance services
YAO-MFI receives around 10-20 loans proposals every month of which only 3-7 proposals are approved due to the limited funds to be disbursed
It is a similar situation at TLM
According to the Executive Director, the proportion of proposals being approved amounts to only around 25% of the proposals being submitted
Based upon the amount of money borrowed from the existing formal and non-formal institutions as well as the current government programs, the need for finance amongst poor households ranges from Rp100,000 to Rp10 million, with an average of approximately Rp2 million
If differentiated on the basis of type of employment, poor farmers need around Rp1.5 million or the cost of one calf, whereas poor households whose incomes do not just come from farming but also other non-agricultural businesses, need around Rp2.5 million because of their need to develop both agricultural and non-agricultural businesses
On average, the need for finance in rural areas is greater than that in urban areas
The size of the poor's demand for loans that has not been met is almost the same as the size of the poor's loans that have been met
For businesses that combine both agricultural and non-agricultural activities, the size of the demand is around Rp1.5 million in rural areas and Rp1.3 million in urban areas
Meanwhile the size of the demand for small businesses in urban areas is around Rp3.2 million
On top of this unmet demand, there is actually a lot of potential demand that has yet to materialize
The limited markets and technology, which cause agricultural production costs and produce prices to fluctuate greatly, result in farmers being too afraid to take out credit
As a result, although the majority of farmers in NTT own land that is yet to be cultivated and plantations that are not managed optimally, they tend to be afraid to take risks to develop their businesses
Given these circumstances, the need for credit has the potential to increase given technological and market developments
From the perspective of what loans are used for, it is apparent that the poor do not just need loans for their businesses
A large number of loans, especially that from informal institutions, are actually used for everyday necessities, such as house renovations, paying school fees and adat purposes
Despite this, individuals repay loans using the profits from agricultural and non-agricultural businesses
Although such loans do not directly increase the poor's income, they at least ensure their businesses continue to operate smoothly and protect their assets
Savings Needs
There is very little money in the savings accounts held by the poor at formal and non-formal microfinance institutions
Only a few families who are not too poor have savings accounts at banks although they tend to be small and inactive, whereas the poorest of the poor do not have bank accounts
Savings accounts with non-formal institutions also have low balances because they are only used to store deductions from repayments which cannot be withdrawn, furthermore these institutions are not licensed to collect funds from communities
Despite this, it does not mean that poor communities do not save to accumulate assets
A large portion of the community in NTT saves money through purchasing livestock (cows, buffaloes, pigs and horses) and storing food, as the majority of unshelled rice and corn is stored for consumption needs until the following harvest
The need for savings is apparent in the growing number of arisan and savings and loans groups
A respondent classified as very poor admitted that he was only able to set aside Rp5,000 per month
Those who are better off are able to set aside Rp35,000
Setting aside some money to be stored in an arisan group becomes the strategy of the poor to fulfill the demand for saving
Besides this, some people also save around 10-20kg of unhulled rice with unhulled rice savings and loans groups
These savings groups are highly beneficial because if individuals have savings in the group, they can borrow money for household needs or to increase their business capital
Insurance Needs Formal insurance services do not reach the poor at all
The low level of income, limited knowledge of modern risk management, and the location of insurance agencies that are mainly concentrated in big cities are the factors that impede access of the poor to insurance services
The existing insurance schemes such as health insurance, education insurance and life insurance are simply too expensive for the poor and out of their reach
Those respondents who had insurance were those who were much better off
This does not mean however, that the poor do not need insurance
The use of loans to pay for medical treatment and education expenses indicates that there is a need for health insurance and education savings accounts
The poor's insurance needs are met by informal institutions which they create and traditional savings systems, in the form of livestock and food supplies
Besides this, joint-financing systems such as sida or contributions for weddings and funerals, could be seen as a form of traditional insurance for communities in NTT
Money Transfer Needs The respondents who have used transfer services, provided both by banks and post offices are very limited
Out of the 91 respondents, only 10 people have ever used this service
As has been stated in the previous section, transfer facilities are required if children go to school in another region or if there is a family member who works outside of NTT
The increase in the number of migrant workers however, does not necessarily correlate with the increase in the demand for transfers
Some migrant workers tend to give money to relatives or friends to take home
V MICROFINANCE AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION IN NTT
A DISCUSSION
Chapter III and IV of this paper have presented the microfinance services in the sample regions in NTT from the point of view of the providers and clients
This chapter tries to compile the field findings presented in the previous chapters to identify the source of gaps in the provision of microfinance services for the poor in NTT and discuss the potential of microfinance as a tool for reducing poverty
5.1 The Dynamics of Supply and Demand for Microfinance in NTT 
The field findings of this study reconfirm the fact that the poor is not a homogenous group
The poor can be categorised on the basis of the severity of poverty into the not so poor (i.e the near poor), the upper poor, and the poorest of the poor or the lower poor
In addition, the poor's livelihood is influenced by the economic activities of the region where they reside
These activities determine the economic opportunities and risks that they face
To better understand the dynamics of microfinance, this discussion considers the poor within the categories based on the stages in their economic activities that also reflect the severity of poverty, and the stages of regional economic development where they live
The stages in people's economic activities and the regional economic development are a continuum
In this analysis, however, these processes are made discrete in order to simplify the categorization, so that they can be distinguished into two categories, the developing and the less developed
The low-income class with relatively advanced or progressive economic activities is categorized as the near and upper poor, while the one with more simple or subsistence economic activities is categorized as the poorest
It should be noted that this study does not make a clear distinction between the poor and the non-poor, or between the near poor, the upper poor and the lower poor, based on consumption poverty line
The relative severity of poverty referred to in this study is mainly based on the qualitative judgment of the researchers after taking into account various household characteristics including ways to earn income, housing conditions, ownership of assets and daily living conditions
With regard to the economic stages of the regions, the poor can be distinguished into those who live in developing or highly progressing economic regions, i.e the urban and semi-urban areas, and the ones who live in less developed or rural and remote areas with relatively stagnant economic activities
Following this framework therefore, the poor and the low-income class could be distinguished into four categories
1) the near and upper poor who live in urban and semiurban areas; 2) the near and upper poor who live in rural (remote) areas; 3) the poorest who live in urban and semi-urban areas; and 4) the poorest who live in rural (remote) areas (Figure 5.1.)
It is important to note that the proportion of the not so poor and the poorest is not necessarily the same, and so as the proportion of regions that belongs to the developing and less developed categories
In NTT, at the present time, the proportion of regions and people in low-income class that belongs to developing categories are far less than the ones belongs to less developed categories
This study has found that the supply of microfinance services varies across regions and is prevalent only in and near urban economic centers (developing regions)
The near poor and upper poor who live in urban and semi-urban areas (group 1) receive the bulk of microfinance services provided by formal and non-formal MFIs as well as government programs
This group, that constitutes the smallest fraction of the poor in NTT, is mostly low ranking civil servants, traders and workers in small industries
They have been relatively well serviced by existing MFIs
The loans provided by various providers are predominantly business loans/credits, but the clients do not always utilize the loan to develop their business
Although the loans are repaid from the profits of the client's business, a large proportion of the loans are used for other purposes such as to improve housing conditions, pay school fees and other consumption and emergency purposes
It reflects the limitations of business loans in promoting production and productivity improvement
Despite the generous provision of microfinance for this group, there is a mismatch between the objectives of the loan schemes set by the microfinance providers and the needs of the clients
The lower poor or the poorest who live in urban and semi-urban areas, however, do not have as much access as the near and upper poor group, despite the availability of microfinance services
This group (group 3) consists mainly of laborers, households with non-permanent income and subsistence farmers who do not own non-agricultural businesses large enough to be considered creditworthy, particularly by banks and by most government microcredit programs
This group is mostly served by cooperatives that practice as a daily bank and non-formal MFIs that charge high interest rates as well as by loan sharks
Thus, it can be said that the lack of microfinance services for the poorest in urban and semi-urban areas is caused by unsuitable microfinance design and the limited capacity of the poorest
Microfinance services, particularly those of banks and non-formal MFIs, in rural and remote areas are limited
Consequently, the access of the near poor and the upper poor who live in these areas is also lacking although some of them have been able to access the services provided by banks and limited number of non-formal MFIs
It seems that government microcredit programs dominate the microfinance services in this area
Interestingly, this study discovered that in the absence of banks and non-formal MFIs, cooperatives and informal MFIs are mushrooming in these areas, and the not so poor make use of these services
The poorest who live in rural and remote areas, however, are mainly using informal MFIs
Since the economic activities are usually stagnant, the daily bank and loan sharks are not as abundant as in the developing regions
The poorest mainly obtain their loans from informal MFIs, such as arisan and other traditional loan and saving groups, as well as from neighbors/relatives and forward sellers
Although there are a relatively large number of cooperatives, the number of members of each cooperative is limited
For this reason, the limited extent of members' savings inhibits the financial capacity of the cooperative
Finally, the gap between the supply of, and demand for, microfinance services in rural and remote areas is quite significant
Microfinance services in NTT are actually expanding, albeit at a rather slow rate, in both the demand for, and supply of, those services
On the demand side, the opening up of the NTT economy by infrastructure and transportation developments has increased the economic activities of the regions as reflected in the high growth of the regions' gross domestic products (GRDP)
The most recent efforts of government and non-government institutions as well as the private sector to improve the marketing of several tree-crops and to develop new commodities are likely to increase the size of the economy that will, in turn, increase the demand for microfinance services
On the supply side, various institutions acting as both supporters and providers of the services have supported the expansion of microfinance services
Among the institutional supporters that are providing indirect support to the provision of microfinance services, are various donor agencies, large scale NGOs - both national and international NGOs - and the government - at both the national and local level
Donor agencies and large scale NGOs have played important roles in strengthening the institutional and financial capacities of mostly non-formal MFIs, although some also provide assistance to cooperatives and through government programs
This support, however, is rather piece meal and limited in size as it has been provided to only a limited number of institutions and for a short time period
Because the assistance is still very much limited to the existing non-formal MFIs, the MFIs being supported are mostly located in and near urban centers
Although the assistance has been beneficial in increasing the number of clients, the impact on expanding the outreach to rural and remote areas is still very limited
Both the national as well as provincial and district level governments, provide various support through more diverse channels that include banks, cooperatives, and non-formal institutions, on top of their direct involvement as microfinance providers
Although the support is big in total, it is lacking a coherent approach as the support is mostly provided on a project basis through sectoral agencies
The lack of a long-term vision is reflected in the weak institutional and capacity building support to cooperatives, that are formally under the guidance and supervision of the government through the Cooperative and SME Offices
Many cooperatives have gone bankrupt and inactive, while there is also no clear policy regarding a cooperative that acts as daily bank
This has impacted negatively on the image of cooperatives and resulted in a decreased level of public trust in these institutions
The government also provides assistance, mostly financial assistance, to non-formal MFIs, but it is also provided in a piecemeal and ad hoc basis
A local government initiative to create integrated village based MFIs, however, seems to face internal barriers due to a clash of egos between various sectoral offices and the lack of a comprehensive long-term development plan for MFIs
In summary, the main problem with supporters is the lack of a coherent and long-term vision that would enable the supporters to provide more integrated support to the development of MFIs
There is also a lack of comprehensive assessment on the existing capacity and coverage of MFIs in NTT to back such a long-term development vision and plan
The providers of microfinance services are also taking some initiatives
In the banking sector, there are some signs of expansion of national private banks through the opening of new branches in the district capital cities and urban centers
This has certainly stimulated local economies although the impact on the provision of microfinance services will likely be limited to the not so poor group
The expansion of BPRs, however, is not happening yet
With regard to cooperatives, despite the large number of establishments, the institutional development and performance in terms of outreach and expanding services to the poor is still unclear
It is quite ironic, given that many savings and loans groups are being enhanced as cooperatives, which is still considered as an ideal type of MFIs instead of BPR
The non-formal MFIs run by NGOs have also been expanding quite fast recently; supported by various donor agencies and national as well as international NGOs
The coverage of each non-formal MFI is still limited in number and in geographical size
Most of these MFIs also have limited human resource and institutional capacity as well as limited capital
But they have the potential to be improved and strengthened
The role of governments as microfinance providers presents a dilemma since its current market share is still quite large, but the approach that has been taken is ad hoc and less effective, both in reaching the poor and in supporting long term business development
In addition, there is the moral hazard and crowding out effects that have impacted on the operation and the development of other MFIs
As has already been recommended by various studies internationally, however, it would be better if the involvement of government as microcredit provider be limited or even ended, and the government support shifted to the provision of applied technology and opening up markets for produce as well as creating a conducive environment for the establishment and growth of small businesses
To sum up, there is much to be done to develop MFIs in NTT in order to increase the geographical coverage and to reach the poorer segments of the community
These include the development of various MFIs with a diversity of services to serve various groups of the poor in various regions, backed up by a long-term vision and plan for MFIs development in the region
5.2 The Potential of Microfinance in Reducing Poverty in NTT 
While the utilization of microfinance services can be easily recognized, the impact of the services on reducing poverty is not straightforward
The potential of microfinance services to reduce poverty will be dependent on various economic and social conditions that drive business development, accumulation of assets, management of risks and vulnerabilities, as well as making long term human investment
In line with the growing knowledge and understanding of the multidimensional characteristics of poverty, the role of microfinance has also departed from a focus on support for the poor's production and productivity
The role of microfinance has been broadened to supporting improvements in the general welfare condition of the poor, including coping with risks and vulnerabilities caused by seasonal and structural shocks (such as drought and economic crisis), events in one's life cycle (such as marriage, funerals, and child birth), and unanticipated crises and emergencies (such as sickness, crime and natural disaster)
Microfinance is also seen as a vehicle to increase one's dignity through empowering people to seek better opportunities in developing business as well as in making long-term investments
Following this multidimensional approach to poverty, the benefits of microfinance services in poverty alleviation should be seen from the point of view of how the services have contributed to overcoming various aspects of the deprivations faced by the poor
These benefits are dependent upon the existing poverty conditions of the poor, which mostly have a locally specific dimension
As has been described in Section 1.5 as well as Section 4.1 and Section 4.2, poverty in NTT has some distinctive characteristics, including low level of economic activities supported by low infrastructure facilities, the predominance of poor farmers dependent on a dry land production base, the low level of human resources both in terms of health as well as education level, high risks and vulnerability due to seasonal drought and natural disasters (earth quake and tsunami) and high cost of adat ceremonies
On the other hand, most of the poor in NTT possess some assets in the form of cultivated and uncultivated farmlands, as well as farm animals and cattle
This study found that the existing microfinance services found in the sample regions, which reflect the majority of services available in NTT, are microcredits focusing on the promotion of production and productivities that are biased towards non-agricultural businesses
Given the existing conditions of the poor in NTT, the benefit of this type of service to the majority of the poor will be limited
There are several limitations
Firstly, as has been discussed in length in the previous section, the majority of poor farmers are not considered eligible to receive the services of microfinance institutions
Secondly, the small size of the economy of the regions limits the expansion in production capacity of small businesses that receive loans
Thirdly, most clients have used the business loans for other purposes
No MFIs have yet responded to the high demand for services other than business loans and are mainly still exploring opportunities to expand their business loans portfolios
The informal MFIs based on community groups have actually served this need with limited financial and management capacities
The locally specific characteristics of the poor in NTT create major challenges to microfinance services to lift the welfare condition of the poor
Without a successful attempt to improve the economy of the regions and to promote the business development of the poor, microfinance services focusing merely on business loans and credits will have a limited capacity to reduce poverty in the long run
Meanwhile, there has been no attempt to explore the development of microfinance services that are better suited to the poverty condition in NTT, i.e
services that could help the poor in facing risks and vulnerability as well as to facilitate an improvement in human development in health and education
Although these types of microfinance services depart from the traditional business microcredit approach, there have been some innovations in other parts of the world that try to address this demand through product innovation that involves combinations of savings and microinsurance
Such an effort would be crucial for the development of microfinance services if it were to be of benefit to a long-term poverty reduction effort in NTT
VI CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.1 Conclusions
1. The poor's access to microfinance services varies according to the type of provider
Services provided by banks are generally difficult to access by the poor because of the concentration of services in urban economic centers and policies relating to microfinance services not yet accommodating the needs of poor communities
The near poor and the upper poor obtain microfinance services from non-bank microfinance institutions (MFIs), non-formal MFIs, microfinance services provided through government programs and informal institutions
Those who are very poor however, are only able to obtain assistance from some services provided through government programs and informal institutions, as well as dailly bank and loan sharks
2. Microfinance services, provided by both the government and non-government institutions, are dominated by microcredits for small business
Credits provided by government are largely given to community groups in the form of funds or credits to be revolved to other groups
This system does not effectively support the business of the recipients and the sustainability of group activities because the speed with which funds revolve between groups does not allow for capital accumulation for business development
Meanwhile, farmers, the majority of whom are classified as poor, also have limited access to the loans for small business provided by banks, cooperatives and nonformal MFIs because the available schemes are incompatible with the patterns of farming business activities
3. The small scale of the NTT economy limits the expansion of the provision of business loans and credits focusing on promoting business production and productivity
It also impedes opportunities to develop existing businesses and limits the opportunities to open new ones
Conditions like this do not encourage financial institutions to provide to, and develop their services for, the poor, particularly in less developed regions
Thus the provision of microcredits spreads out more only in urban areas and regions that are close to the center of economic development
4. The poor often utilize loans to ensure food security and make long-term investments in education and housing, although the loan is supposedly for business
This phenomenon indicates that the poor need loans for non-business purposes in order to protect their assets and businesses
Limiting loan purposes only for business could limit the benefit of, and access to, credits by the poor
5. Because they cannot access the savings services provided by banks, the poor tend to make use of the services offered by informal savings and loans institutions (arisan groups) managed by the communities themselves
This certainly indicates the potential for savings activities for the poor that have not yet been provided
The physical distance and the formality of banks' saving facilities limit the poor's access to saving services provided by banks
Formal non-bank MFIs such as cooperatives provide very limited saving facilities, while the non-formal MFIs are not allowed to provide saving services based on the existing laws
6. The variety of needs and the living conditions of the poor also influence the diversity of needs for microfinance services
Except for transfers, there is a real need for loans, savings and insurance in their daily lives
Formal insurance services have not touched poor communities because there are no microinsurance services yet
The demand for savings and insurance, for dealing with seasonal cycles, life cycle events (funerals, marriages), and long term investments is fulfilled by traditional means such as animal husbandry activities, storage of harvest produce in barns, joining arisan or saving and loan groups, and the system of communal financing based on kinship
7. Technical support provided for microfinance activities is still limited
The capacity and capability of cooperatives are very low
Despite the rapid expansion of non-formal MFIs, their capacity and capability varies, while their regional coverage and number of customers are limited
To date, laws that could provide clear legal status have not backed up the development of non-formal MFIs
Efforts by the government (BI) to build the capacity of non-bank formal microfinance institutions, such as cooperatives, non-formal microfinance institutions as well as services provided through government programs, have been inadequate
6.2 Recommendations
A General
Recommendations The provision of microfinance services has the potential to support poverty reduction efforts in NTT
Because of the limited economic capacity of the regions and the diversity of poverty conditions in NTT however, policy-makers and microfinance service providers and supporters need to take into account the following issues
1. Poverty reduction interventions through the provision of microfinance services should be implemented within the framework of market mechanisms, so that they do not interfere with, or overwhelm, the existing microfinance institutions
2. With the exception of several urban areas, there are only a few regions in NTT where the economic activities provide fertile grounds for the growth of small business
Consequently, independent microfinance services focusing only on the provision of business loans with a daily or weekly repayment system and short loan periods are suitable only for a small number of people who already own businesses and are of limited benefit for improving the welfare level of the majority of the poor in NTT
To increase the benefit of microfinance services for the majority of the poor in NTT, therefore, the expansion of the services both in terms of geographical coverage and financial deepening should be done
a) after, or in conjunction with, efforts to increase economic activities that provide new opportunities for the emergence and growth of small business
and b) using more product innovations that are suited to the needs and the capacity of the local poor, and that involve a variety of services on top of business loans
3. The provision of microcredit services in the form of economic development packages should be carefully designed in order to avoid supply-driven services and moral hazards as has occurred so far with government credit programs
One alternative is to separate microfinance service providers from technical and marketing assistance providers
The programs, however, have to be developed and implemented in an integrated fashion
In this model, a diverse range of microfinance programs can be implemented at the same time as programs designed to strengthen local economies through the provision of technical and marketing assistance in certain regions
Such integrated efforts require comprehensive research into the community livelihoods, the community institutional capacity as well as business opportunities and challenges, so that the microfinance services can help the poor to improve their business, cope with risks and vulnerability, and make long-term investments
4. Economic development activities, such as the joint cattle production program complemented with intensive technical and marketing assistance, are one type of activity that is fairly successful
This approach is very useful for the poor because of the low risks involved
The loss of either the technical assistance or the guaranteed market components however, would reduce the program's effectiveness, or perhaps even cause the poor to become even poorer because they would be liable for all business risks
The sustainability of this approach, however, would be at risk without attempts to strengthen the providers of this program
5. Microfinance institutions that provide a variety of services, or at least savings and loans, would be more beneficial for the poor
The combination of savings and loans could function as insurance for the poor
The loans and credit should not only be available for business needs, but also for consumption, emergencies, education and residential building purposes
There is also a need to adapt the loan and credit schemes to the production cycles of agricultural businesses because the majority of the poor earn their living in the agricultural sector
6. The expansion of diverse and flexible microfinance services to increase the outreach of the services to the poor who are widely dispersed across the interior will be very costly
The development of saving facilities is also impeded by the existing regulations that limit the collection of savings to banking institutions and cooperatives, although such regulations are necessary to protect depositors
Therefore, the alternatives to increase the outreach of saving and loan facilities could be done through linking the non-formal and informal MFIs with banks and through an extensive outreach program of banks such as a mobile banking system
Several models such as linking banks and community groups (PHBK), Swamitra, village service centers and mobile units could be further explored as alternatives for increasing the coverage
B Recommendations for Local Government
Regional government should not be directly involved as microfinance providers because it could create conflicts of interest and impair the main function of government
Instead, local government could play a strategic role in the development of microfinance services through its role as
1. a regulator that monitors the implementation of the existing regulations, particularly in controlling and developing favorable relationships between MFIs and their clients, and that spells out the existing laws and develops local regulations that suit local conditions and needs
To support this function, local government should increase its capacity to monitor and assess the provision of microfinance services by various institutions
3. the provider of assistance, both direct assistance to the general public and through existing and newly formed community groups
Direct assistance to the community through extension programs should be maintained and improved to support the poor's business development including agribusiness
C Recommendations for Funding Agencies
The form of assistance which could be provided by funding agencies will depend on whether the agency wishes to adopt an approach that puts more emphasize on short-term poverty reduction or long term development of viable and sustainable MFIs
For the first approach, a program such as the joint cattle production program could be one of the approaches to be adopted
A funding agency could search for an institution to implement such programs and provide necessary assistance that would enable the selected institution to identify business opportunities and formulate an integrated program plan
For the second approach, including
1. Macro
funding agency could assist regional governments to formulate policies that create a conducive environment for the development of MFIs and increase the outreach of MFIs so that they can serve a larger number of clients and reach the poorer segment of the lowincome class
This could be done through improving the capacity and capability of local government as regulator and facilitator as well as provider of assistance for the development of MFIs as stated in point B
At the same time, funding agency could assist regional governments to shift its focus of assistance from the direct provision of microcredits to a more systematic and intensive effort aimed at strengthening the economic position of the poor through technical assistance and technological innovations to increase production and productivity, as well as improvements in access to markets for their produce
2. Meso
funding agency could provide indirect support to improve the capacity and capability of the existing MFIs through technical assistance to, and training for, microfinance providers to develop the types and forms of services that better suit the livelihood and the needs of the poor
Assistance could be provided through large institutions that have implemented a variety of programs to strengthen microfinance institutions
Alternatively, funding agency could assist or facilitate the establishment of links or collaboration between formal MFIs and non-formal MFIs in order to increase the outreach of microfinance services as well as provide a more diversified range of services that would be more beneficial for the poorer groups
3. Micro
funding agency could provide direct technical and financial assistance to microfinance institutions
This option, however, would be better implemented as a follow-up to the activities in points 1 and 2 above
It is not advisable to provide largescale funds in a short time frame without sufficient technical assistance, given the limited human resource and management capacities of the existing MFIs
The assistance to microfinance institutions should be provided on a long-term basis that could be 3 to 5 years
There are three types of MFIs that could be assisted
non-formal MFIs managed by NGOs, cooperatives and MFIs formed through government programs such as UPKD (created under NTAADP), and LPD/LPK (created by BPMD Kabupaten Manggarai)
This intervention would require the support of a comprehensive research program into the capacity of institutions that would be assisted as well as the opportunities and the risks involved
In providing direct assistance, the following principles should be applied
The formation and development of microfinance institutions, particularly cooperative and village level MFIs, should ensure the full participation of the poor, both men and women, and be driven by demand from the majority of the poor in the respected localities
The provision of full-time professional assistants should be an inseparable part of the assistance
The professional assistants should cover both institutional consultants for the MFI and business consultants for poor families
In relation to this, all costs associated with assistants must be separated from the operational expenses of microfinance institutions
This first monitoring update highlights findings from SMERU's qualitative studies in seven communities and media monitoring up to mid-October 2009
The studies reveal that the current global financial crisis (GFC) in Indonesia has had a variety of different impacts
In general, the negative impacts became apparent in October-November 2008 and peaked in January-February 2009
Recently, they have leveled off with signs of mild recovery in some sectors
The level of severity, however, varies across livelihood types and exposure to the developed countries hit hard by the crisis
The sectors that experienced export booms due to the depreciation of the Rupiah during the 1997/98 Asian Financial Crisis have tended to be more severely affected by the current GFC
Despite signs of mild recovery, there is an indication of a declining trend in wage levels among industrial laborers
In the community, the poorest have been the most severely impacted
Nevertheless, the experiences of the community illustrate the benefits of some of the existing social protection programs, particularly those focused on the education and health sectors, in mitigating the impact of the crisis
The global financial crisis has affected countries all over the world, and Indonesia is no exception
However, the macro data suggests that the impact of the crisis on Indonesia has not been too severe
The Indonesian economy recorded a slower growth of 5.2% (year on year) during the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to 6.4% in the third quarter of 2008
Positive growth of 4.4% was still recorded in the first quarter of 2009 and 4% in the second quarter of 2009
Disaggregation by sector indicates that the major slow down was in the manufacturing industry-particularly textile, leather, footwear, and wood products
Another sector experiencing slower growth is the trade, hotel, and restaurant sector-particularly in terms of retail and wholesale trade
From the usage side, exports and imports experienced negative growth, while capital formation declined significantly during the last two quarters
As economic observers experience mixed feelings of optimism and cautiousness, there has been concern about what is happening at the community level and in the real sectors, beyond the macro data
In an effort to obtain a better understanding about the social and economic impacts of the crisis, starting in July 2009 The SMERU Research Institute is conducting a series of studies through media monitoring, analysis of secondary data, and qualitative monitoring at the local level.i This paper provides a summary of the findings and analysis from the studies conducted from July to mid-October 2009
These studies included media monitoring of various national and local newspapers and magazines, analysis of secondary data available from Statistics Indonesia and the Central Bank of Indonesia (Bank Indonesia-BI), and qualitative monitoring in seven potentially affected communities
The seven communities covered in the studies are communities which contain textile and garment industries in Bandung, West Java; an industrial park that mostly consists of automotive and electronic industries in Bekasi, West Java; a palm oil industry and plantation in Kampar, Riau; exported pottery home industries in Lombok Barat, West Nusa Tenggara; wooden furniture industries in Jepara, Central Java; fisheries industry and fishing communities in Bitung, North Sulawesi; and migrant workers in Malang, East Java
In addition, the analysis also incorporates findings from an earlier qualitative study conducted in February 2009 on a rubber plantation and an industrial park for automotive and electronic industries.iii While the analysis in this update does not provide nationally representative data, the qualitative analysis is focused on identifying who has been affected by the GFC and understanding why some industries or communities are less affected than others
The results of the media monitoring and qualitative studies reveal the impact of the GFC on various sectors and the differences in scope and severity of the impact
Some of the sectors which have been impacted by the global financial crisis are described below
A Exported Agriculture Commodities 
Many newspaper articles have reported that some exported plantation commodities, particularly rubber and oil palm, were the most negatively affected because of the sudden fall in product prices
The international price of rubber decreased from US 329.75 cents per kg in June 2008 to US 280.5 cents per kg in September 2008, and by December 2008 had fallen even further to US 120 cents per kg
This caused the farm-gate price of rubber lump in many producing areas in Sumatra, Kalimantan, and West Java to decline significantly from around Rp10,000-Rp12,000 per kg to as low as Rp2,000-Rp3,000 per kg in December 2008
As a result, many farmers were no longer willing to tap their rubber trees or carry out appropriate land clearing and fertilize trees
There is a report that some farmers in Banyuasin, South Sumatra sold their land cheaply due to the fall in the rubber price
The drop in lump supply has caused some rubber processing firms to reduce working days or even temporarily halt their operations
It has been reported that six rubber processing firms in West Sumatra stopped their operations, which led to the dismissal of around 3,000 workers
However, more recently it has been reported that the farm-gate price of lump in various producing areas in Sumatra and Kalimantan has steadily increased to around Rp5,000-Rp6,000 per kg in June 
and in some areas has reached Rp7,000 per kg in October 2009
The field study in Kabupaten Banjar, South Kalimantan in February revealed that the farmers that grow rubber trees enjoyed a windfall income during the 1997/98 Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) because the farm-gate price of rubber lump increased significantly from around Rp7,000 per kg to Rp12,000 per kg
This had brought significant increases in the welfare level of the communities
Following the GFC, on the other hand, the price of the rubber lump fell from Rp11,200 per kg in September 2008 to the lowest price of Rp2,500 per kg in October 2008
Then it increased slightly to Rp3,750 per kg in January 2009
The sudden fall in lump price has led to a significant drop in income for both the land owners and the farm laborers
Most farmers could not afford to buy fertilizer for their rubber trees
Many land owners reduced the number of farm laborers or no longer employ farm laborers at all
The reduction in income and job opportunities has forced them to look for other odd jobs or move to other regions to look for job opportunities
The effects of this were felt in the local economy as retail trade; transport businesses transporting people, rubber, and coal; and rubber sap trading slowed down
Many farmers that had bought motorcycles on credit returned the motorcycle to the dealer because they were no longer able to pay the installments
Currently, the economy is slightly better off as the farm-gate lump price has steadily increased and reached a level of around Rp5,500-Rp6,500 per kg in October 2009; although this is still lower than the pre-GFC price
Similarly, the fall in international demand for crude palm oil (CPO) has led to a significant decline in CPO price from US$1,400 per metric ton before the crisis to around US$400-US$500 per metric ton
Consequently, the farm-gate price of oil palm fresh fruit bunch (FFB) also declined from Rp1,500-Rp2,000 per kg in July 2008 to around Rp300 by the end of 2008
The significant drops in the prices of CPO and FFB have caused big losses for both farmers and palm oil processing industries
Many farmers failed to pay back their loans for working capital or motorcycles
The Riau branch of the Central Bank of Indonesia, for example, reported that more than 280,000 farmers failed to pay their debts, totaling Rp1.2 trillion
The cancelation of orders caused significant decline in CPO exports, and the collapse of many processing firms, including those located in South Sumatra, Riau, Central Kalimantan, and West Kalimantan
It has been reported that in the second quarter of 2009 the CPO price increased to US$750 per metric ton, but the FFB price is still fluctuating-in South Sumatra, for example, it reached Rp1,400 per kg in September 2009 but dropped to around Rp1,000 per kg in October 2009
The field study in Kampar in July 2009 confirms the severe impacts of the decline of the CPO and FFB prices
In the study village, the farm-gate FFB price decreased from Rp1,100 in June 2008, to Rp600 in October 2008, and dropped as low as Rp200-Rp350 in January 2009
The price then increased to Rp1,000 in April 2009 but then declined slightly to Rp750 in June 2009
During the period when the price of FFB was at its lowest, many farmers did not harvest the palm fruit, or if they did harvest it to keep the tree productive, they did not sell it to a processing factory because the transport cost was higher than the price of the palm fruit
Almost all farmers failed to pay back their working capital and consumer loans (mostly to buy motorcycles) to the village loan and saving unit capitalized by local government; so the unit rescheduled farmers loans
As the price of fertilizer (urea) escalated from Rp1,800 per kg in July 2008 to Rp8,000 per kg from September 2008 to April 2009, farmers could not afford to buy it
The palm oil processing industry was also badly affected as the CPO production fell significantly and CPO that could not be exported is now being stockpiled in large quantities at the Dumai port
Although the company has not laid off their workers, it reduced working hours from 12 to 10 hours a day
This means that workers' monthly income has declined from around Rp1.9 million to Rp1.4 million
This also took place in oil palm plantations, 
both the state- and private-owned plantations did not lay off their farm laborers; instead they abolished over-time so that a laborer's monthly income dropped from Rp2.5 million to Rp1.08 million
The fall in farmers, factory workers, and plantation workers incomes has caused the circulation of money in the local weekly market to drop from around Rp400 million before the crisis to Rp100 million when the crisis was at its peak
By July 2009, the condition had recovered slightly and the turnover in the local market increased to Rp200 million
In addition to rubber and palm oil, other exported commodities that have been reported in many newspaper articles as being affected by the crisis are coffee, cocoa, copra, corn, and cassava
The GFC has led to the decline in international demand for coffee and a slight fall in the international price from US$3,800 to US$3,200 per metric ton
Among the reported consequences are
in East Java, the export of coffee fell by 25%-30% and the price declined from Rp18,000 to Rp16,000 per kg; 
in Bandar Lampung, the price dropped from Rp25,000 to Rp16,000 per kg; in South Sumatra, the price fell from Rp15,000 to Rp11,000 per kg; 
and in North Sumatra, many exporters to the US went bankrupt because they already purchased from the farmers well in advance before the coffee price dropped
The price of coffee, however, has recently increased due to the limited production before the harvest season
In the case of cocoa, in Bali the price dropped from Rp31,000 to Rp17,000 per kg; while in North Sumatra it dropped from Rp20,000 to Rp16,000
Cocoa exports from South Sulawesi decreased from 47,240 tons during January-May 2008 to 37,204 tons during the same period in 2009
In addition, out of 14 cocoa processing factories in Indonesia, 12 have halted their production due to significant declines in demand for cocoa from the US and European markets, as well as because of the long delay in payment that caused cash flow restrain
The cocoa price has gone back to normal recently
In Lampung, for example, the price of premiumquality dried cocoa in September and October 2009 increased steadily from Rp23,000-Rp24,000 to Rp25,000-Rp27,000 per kg
Another commodity reported in various newspaper articles was the fall by almost 50% of the price of copra in West Sumatra and Jambi
The price of corn in Lampung was also reported to have declined by 50%, but the corn price in Gorontalo has been relatively stable
The price of cassava was also reported to have fallen by 50% in Lampung
In North Sumatra, the export of fruit and vegetables to Singapore fell temporarily
Fisheries products for export were also reported to be experiencing a decline
Newspaper articles revealed that exports of canned and processed fish from North Sulawesi decreased by 40% in 2008, compared to 2007
This is because the demand from the main export destinations-Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, the US, and several European countries-declined during the period of October-December 2008
In East Java, the demand for exported shrimp fell by 10%-15% during October 2008, but then increased by 7% during March 2009
In Bandar Lampung, the price of shrimp dropped from Rp42,000-Rp47,000 per kg in mid-2008 to around Rp38,000 by the end of 2008
In Jakarta, the price of exported tuna declined from Rp12,500-Rp14,000 per kg to Rp8,000 during the crisis
However, generally the GFC was not the only factor contributing to the fall in fish exports since there were also problems with production
The field study in the fisheries industry area in Bitung in early October 2009 shows no significant impact from the GFC, both to the fisheries industry and the community
This occurred due to the ability of most industries to shift their market destination from the declining market in the US and Japan to other countries including those in the Middle East; European Union; and Asia, including China and South Korea
The prices of exported tuna and canned fish are relatively stable
Only one product, ikan kayu (dried tuna), which used to be exported to Japan, experienced a fall in price from US$6.8 per kg in November 2008 to US$4.8 per kg in December 2008, stabilizing at around US$4.5 per kg in the following months
But this decline did not cause much disruption to the industry, because exports to Japan could be shifted to other Asian countries
For the industry, the main problem is the decline in the supply of fish because the central government recently released a new policy
This policy allows fishing vessels to moor and unload the fish at any port near the fishing ground; there is no longer any requirement to return to the port where the vessel departed from
Because of this policy, most big fishing boats that used to moor in Bitung are now mooring in Maluku; causing the supply of fish in Bitung to decrease significantly
Small-scale fishers have experienced worse conditions and difficulties in their lives due to the increase in fuel price, particularly kerosene, and the more extensive operations of large fishing vessels
Lots of smallscale fishers are abandoning fishing and instead working as daily workers in fish processing industries that have been flourishing in the region recently, or they are becoming informal workers doing odd jobs, including ojek (motorcycle taxi) drivers and construction workers
B Timber and Wooden Products 
The GFC has led to a decline in the demand for timber as well as wooden furniture in the US, Europe, and Japan
Some regions in Indonesia that export timber and plywood, including West Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, North Sumatra, and Papua, have reported a decrease in exports
The consequences of this were the halt of many sawmill operations and the laying off of more than 10,000 workers
Some articles also revealed that in East and Central Java there was a decline in wooden furniture exports
Jepara in Central Java is a major producer of crafted teak wood furniture
The field study in this area shows that the producers and exporters of garden furniture for the US and European markets are the most affected by the crisis, and the few that have survived shifted their market destination to Eastern Europe
On the other hand, the producers of indoor furniture for domestic and Asian markets have not been affected by the current crisis
The exporters of wooden furniture to the US and Europe enjoyed big profits during the AFC
This led to the rise in the number of both domestic and foreign companies in this district, and massive illegal logging of teak wood, as well as a decline of product quality
For the past five years, exports have been decreasing because of low quality and illegal logging
The industry has also been declining due to difficulties in obtaining raw materials, and the high price of teak wood due to its scarcity
The Bali bombing also caused a decline in the volume of exports through Bali, 
however some foreign companies overcame this by opening factories in the producing region
The GFC has made life more difficult because some foreign furniture factories went bankrupt and many local laborers were laid off
The lay offs included both men and women as men generally worked in the assembly sector and women in the finishing sector
Most of the laid off workers moved into the agriculture or fisheries sectors, or carried out other odd jobs
The workers generally used to work in these areas before the furniture sector boomed during the AFC
Although the GFC caused the local economy to shrink, the impact to local livelihoods has not been too severe as alternative jobs are still available
C Mining Industries 
Another group of primary products reported to be affected by the crisis are those related to mining, including coal, nickel, bauxite, iron, steel, copper, aluminum, and marble
In South Kalimantan, the price of good quality coal (containing 6,000 kilo calories per kg) dropped from US$90 per ton to around US$50-$60 per ton
Up to August 2009, coal production from this province had declined by 40%-50% compared to the same period last year
Also, the frequency of ships transporting coal along the Mahakam River was down from 18-20 trips a day to only 10-12 trips each day
The fall in the demand and price of coal has caused many mining, stock piling, and transport businesses to halt
Lately, the demand for and price of coal have been recovering
However, the down turn effects from the crisis have been prolonged by the implementation of the provincial government's new policy (through Provincial Government Regulation No 3/2008) that bans trucks transporting coal and oil palm from using public roads
In Banjar, in particular, where the ban has been put into effect, lots of small and medium sized mining related activities have been brought to a standstill because the road for transporting coal and oil palm is not ready
In other regions it was reported that two big mining companies, PT Freeport Indonesia (FI) in Papua and PT Inco in South Sulawesi, were hit by the crisis
To increase efficiency, PT FI did not lay off its workers but instead refrained from recruiting new ones
However, hundreds of laborers who worked in PT FI subcontracting companies were laid off
In the case of PT Inco, there was great concern over the possibility that some workers may be laid off
However, the company assured that this would be the last option, after other efficiency efforts including shifting to lower costing energy and being more selective with assistance given to the local government and communities
The indicative impact of the GFC in these two provinces can be seen from the decline in export figures
In Papua, the export of copper during 2008 was 25% lower than that for 2007; while in South Sulawesi, total export of mining products during the first semester of 2009 dropped by 18.5% in terms of volume and by 68% in terms of value
D Manufacturing Industries 
Based on media monitoring results, it was found that manufacturing industries have been hit hard by the crisis, although the level of severity varies across industries
Textile, garment, and footwear, as well as electronic and automotive industries, have been the most affected
Food, beverage, and cigarette industries have been the least affected-although some of the companies that export their products to the US and Japan have also been affected by the crisis
In the case of the textile and garment industries, many media articles and official reports illustrate the potential adverse impacts of the crisis
It was estimated that the crisis would reduce production by 10%
Given that some 1.2 million people work in this industry, the potential lay offs could involve more than 100,000 workers
The centers of the industry in West and Central Java, as well as in Banten, have reportedly been hit by the crisis
In Bandung and Cimahi, for example, the official data recorded that tens of thousands of workers in around 40 garment and textile industries have been temporarily laid off due to the combined effects of the drop in demand and the increase in input prices
In Purwakarta, more than 6,000 workers have potentially lost their jobs because a company in the US has canceled its contract, worth US$2 million
Similarly, 400,000 workers in the textile and garment industries in Central Java (Solo, Kendal, Semarang, and Boyolali) may be laid off because of the cancelation of orders from the US, West Europe, South Korea, and Turkey
The study in one village in Kabupaten Bandung shows that the impact of the GFC is potentially more severe for large-scale industries that export their products to the US and Europe
Although these industries are still producing for the 2008 contract orders, this year most big firms have not received new orders for 2010
They have also expressed concerns over tighter competition with China and India in the shrinking global garment and textile markets following the GFC
Thus, although the firms have not laid off workers, some have not extended the contracts of contract workers, and there is the potential for further adverse impacts if the crisis is prolonged
Contract laborers who did not have their contracts extended mostly got jobs in the medium and small scale garment and textile industries, located in the study village or neighboring villages
These smaller scale industries survived due to the increased domestic demand during the legislative and presidential elections early this year, and ahead of the post- Ramadan Idul Fitri celebrations
The consequence of such a shift, however, is lower income, because smaller firms provide fewer benefits than big firms
At the time the study was being conducted in July 2009, the garment and textile workers in this village, who are mostly women, had not yet realized the negative impact of the crisis
In contrast, an industrial park in Bekasi, which is mostly occupied by electronic and automotive industries, has experienced a slow down in production activities since October 2008
Although only one company was reported to have gone bankrupt, some temporarily halted production and reduced working hours
Many contract workers, mostly from outsourcing companies, did not have their contracts extended, or in some cases even had their contracts terminated before the end of the contract period, 
and permanent workers received no over time or had their working days reduced
These events have had a significant impact on the local economy since many businesses that support the activities in the industrial park, such as transport, waste processing, dormitory, and catering businesses, as well as, food stalls, mobile phone kiosks, leasing companies (mostly for cars and motorcycles), outsourcing companies, and shops collapsed
The economic down turn was very much felt in February 2009
The condition in August 2009 was slightly better as some laborers were being recruited again
But the recovery has not been spread evenly across areas and industries
There is also the tendency for laborers to receive a lower income, because most companies prefer to recruit single and fresh graduate workers to avoid the obligation to provide family assistance
Companies also introduced a different way of calculating overtime costs
The recovery of the local economy is also lagging behind, because after the difficulties and great uncertainties during the peak of the crisis, workers are being more careful with their money
E Handicrafts 
Various types of exported handicrafts also suffer greatly from the fall in demand from the US, European, and Japanese markets
From Bali, it was reported that the production of silver craft products and wooden masks have fallen by around 50% because they are currently completing last year's contract, and no new contracts have been obtained
Since October 2008, in South Sumatra most buyers from Singapore and the US have stopped purchasing songket woven sarongs, so that some weavers have ceased their weaving activities
In East Java, the production of brass ornaments has declined by around 50% because orders from the US, Japan, Europe, and Australia reduced
Various types of handicrafts from Central Java and Yogyakarta also experienced a reduction in demand from foreign countries
Field monitoring in Lombok Barat, where pottery used to be one of the primary exported commodities, showed that for pottery makers the GFC had a very different impact compared to that of the AFC
During the AFC, pottery makers enjoyed the benefits from booms in exports due to the rupiah depreciation
This boosted local economic development, supported by the upstream and downstream industries of the pottery business
The GFC on the contrary, has worsened the already declining trend in ceramic exports after the Bali bombings in 2002 and 2005
As the demand for exports fell, almost no new orders were received from January to March 2009
This has caused a drastic decline in the industry
Many female pottery makers have no other jobs or income, and some shifted production to traditional terra cotta household appliances that are much cheaper but can be sold locally
The male pottery makers generally moved to jobs as peddlers selling various products, selling terracotta household appliances, or migrate to other regions
Many villagers have worked overseas, but lately the number is increasing significantly
The impacts spread not only to the upstream and downstream industries of the pottery production, but also to the local economy
It is now harder for the youth to get jobs, because the pottery making used to absorb lots of youth and even children (to work after school) to help in the finishing stages
F Migrant Workers 
The economic contraction in countries affected by the GFC is potentially impacting on international migrant workers
To understand the dynamic of migrant worker conditions during this crisis, a qualitative study was conducted in a village in Malang, where more than 40% of the households have member/s that have worked as migrant workers
According to the interviews and discussions with the migrant families and ex-migrant workers, the most affected migrant workers are those who work in the electronic, automotive, and construction industries in South Korea, and Malaysia
Those who work as domestic workers and who work in the Middle East have not been affected
The affected migrants are mostly not returning home because most of them are still working, but with shorter working hours or without the opportunity to work over time
Consequently, their income has dropped and so the remittance has also dropped by around 25%-50%
Some of them have not had their contracts extended, but they are still waiting for the industry to recover because the companies where they worked have requested that they do not return home
Another reason why these workers do not return home is because most of them are illegal, so if they return home it will be difficult for them to leave again
A more pressing problem is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to migrate, because of tighter competition
For example, the implementation of new government-to-government recruitment policy and non-transparency in the queuing for the recruitment process has made it very difficult to go to South Korea, although the cost is cheaper
As for the family at home, the lower remittance they receive from relatives working overseas is not affecting their lives dramatically, 
because they have other sources of income-some of which have been developed from previous remittances
Other sources of income for the villagers, including rice, cassava, and sugar cane plantations also provide good income
Thus, the impact of the GFC on the local economy of the village has been rather limited
G Tourism 
Another potentially affected sector that has been widely covered in the media is the tourism sector
The UN-WTO predicted that the GFC would cause tourist arrivals in the Asia-Pacific to decline by 6%
However, the impact of the GFC on the tourism industry in Indonesia seems to be limited
The statistics on foreign tourist arrivals in Bali, as the main foreign tourist destination in Indonesia, shows a strong increasing trend
The number of foreign tourist arrivals in Bali and in Indonesia has reached a level higher than before the first Bali bombing
The increase could be attributed to security problems in other competitor tourist destinations, such as Thailand; as well as the increase in the number of low spending tourists
The change is marked by the decrease in the number of tourists from Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea; and the increase of those from Australia, China, and Malaysia
The increase in the number of tourists from Malaysia and China, however, has had a limited impact on the tourism supporting industries and local economy in general because these tourists tend to be low spenders
Consequently, in spite of the increase in the number of foreign tourist visits, the sale of handicrafts in Bali is declining
The other tourist destinations of Yogyakarta, East Java, North Sumatra, and South Sulawesi have reported slight decreases in the number of foreign tourist visits
This is in line with the increasing trend of the low budget tourists, who tend to spend limited time in Bali and not extend their stays to go to other tourist destinations in Indonesia
But the impact of the decrease on hotel room occupancy rates was not significant because the decline was compensated for by the increase in the number of domestic tourists
The communities being affected by the GFC are not homogenous, and the severity of effects felt is not uniform
In general, the GFC has caused decreases in business profits, incomes, and job opportunities
In turn, this could change the general welfare of the affected people as the financial shocks could impede their ability to fulfill basic needs, 
as well as alter human security and social relations
Although the wealthy groups of society, such as business operators, farm owners, and traders, are losing a lot due to the crisis, they mostly still have other resources or excess capital to cope with a downturn of income
For the poorest members of the community, such as farm laborers, informal laborers doing odd jobs, and ojek drivers, the impact of the crisis is more severe as they have limited assets to cope with the crisis
The impacts of the crisis felt by the affected communities and their coping strategies based on the qualitative monitoring study is presented below
Impact on Labor Market 
The study in Bekasi shows that in the formal sector, the affected industries adopt various coping strategies involving their labor policy
Usually, the first effort is to reduce working hours and cut back on overtime
For permanent staff, temporary lay offs are applied when production is stagnant
The first laborers to be dismissed are those recruited on a contract basis, mostly through an outsourcing company
Some of them did not have their contracts extended, while others had their contracts terminated before the contracted term was complete and did not receive any compensation
Contract workers are usually unemployed between jobs for approximately 1-2 months, but the current crisis has meant that this time period between jobs is longer
If these contract workers are lucky, they get another job in 3-4 months
In February 2009, most companies did not recruit new workers and most labor outsourcing companies reported that they did not receive orders, particularly from automotive and electronics companies
In August 2009, some companies started to put orders in for new laborers
During the crisis period, competition for jobs has been very tight and this has led to an increase in fraud cases in labor placements, as well as lower incomes because workers are forced to accept any salary being offered
Some companies, for example, changed the calculation of overtime compensation from being based on gross salary to being based on basic salary
Other companies have only accepted workers who are single in order to avoid providing family benefits; so that some who are married apply for the job by claiming that they are single and not entitled to family benefits
In times of desperation, some workers are willing to work in other companies or small companies offering wages lower than they used to
This means that workers have a lower income and also an increased feeling of job insecurity
As a result, although the demand for labor has started to increase, meaning those who were laid off could get jobs, the workers are still very thrifty
In plantation farming businesses, farm laborers who do not own land have been the most severely affected by the crisis because the land owners cut labor costs by firing laborers
The farm laborers are forced to look for other jobs; 
some seek their fortune by entering illegal businesses such as illegal mining; some migrate to other regions, gather forest products from nearby forests because they are no longer available in the oil palm plantation areas that used to be forests, or do odd jobs with an unstable income
For women, the crisis has caused sources of income to decline or disappear
In the case of handicraft and furniture industries in Lombok Barat and Jepara, many women are losing job opportunities
This could potentially occur if the garment industry collapses, because most workers in this industry are women
In the case of plantation farming of rubber and oil palm, women from farm laborer families are forced to take up odd jobs with a low wage
For youth, the crisis has led to tighter competition in the labor market
In Lombok Barat, the cessation of pottery production caused many young people to lose their jobs
Previously they had worked decorating and finishing the pottery
The youth in the furniture production region of Jepara are facing a similar situation due to the crisis
The decline of job opportunities for youth who used to work as daily workers in the oil palm plantation in Kampar has led to an increase in criminal activity
During the peak of the crisis many of these youth were becoming ninja (a local term used to refer to masked thieves that stole oil palm or rubber lump from government owned oil palm or rubber plantations)
Impact on Food Consumption 
The GFC has not caused food prices to increase significantly; however, the price level is already high due to the fuel crisis
Thus, the lower income due to the crisis has worsened an already difficult economic situation
To cope with the difficult situation, most households in the villages studied maintain the consumption level of staple food
Families tend to eat less protein or shift to cheaper sources of protein, and also buy less prepared food
If available, they also collect more vegetables, fruits, and roots from surrounding areas, but these foods are becoming difficult to find in industrial areas and oil palm plantations
They also purchase goods in smaller quantities or buy on credit; and this has been supported by fresh food hawkers and local shops that allow people to buy on credit
A government assistance program that is regarded as being beneficial in cushioning food consumption is Raskin (rice for the poor), but the benefits of this program are reduced because of the irregular and unpredictable distribution schedule
Because people do not know when the rice will be delivered, they do not always have money available to buy the subsidized rice
In most villages, the village officials allow all villagers to buy the rice
Meanwhile, although migrant workers are affected by the crisis, they are not entitled to purchase the subsidized rice because it is only allocated to local people
Impact on Education 
With regard to education, the qualitative studies revealed no drop out cases in primary schools
Although the crisis has meant that children get less pocket money from their parents, it has not caused them to be absent from school
The BOS (School Operational Assistance) program and local government assistance to schools (particularly in Banjar) have significantly reduced or even eliminated school fees so that schooling is more affordable even in times of crisis
The case in junior high schools is similar, but some drop out cases have been reported in Kampar 
because the junior high school is located far from the village, and some poor families could not afford to cover transport and living costs during the peak of the crisis
Furthermore, as the price of oil palm increased again, the school was asking parents to pay an entry fee to go back to school, which the families could not afford
Senior high school students are more vulnerable to dropping out
In Banjar, there are cases of students moving to cheaper schools, while in Kampar some senior high school students have been reported as having dropped out
In the case of the village in Bekasi, apart from the government, the private sector and community also provide educational assistance by providing stationery to primary school students and computers to schools
The local community-based organization provides scholarship for orphans, but the crisis meant that the income of the contributors, who are mostly workers in industrial parks, declined and put the continuity of the initiative at risk
Impact on Health 
In general, the health condition of the communities in the villages affected by the crisis has not changed, although the qualitative monitoring revealed some changes in health service seeking behavior
The study found a decline in the number of visits to private clinics and midwives, even though these private health service providers have lowered their charges
More people are self medicating and buying medicine from a drugstore
The visits to puskesmas (community health centers), on the other hand, have increased
In three of the study villages, the district governments have provided free outpatient care at the puskesmas, while in other villages the fees are affordable
To assist the poor in accessing health services, the central government has provided Jamkesmas (community health insurance), but some poor families do not have the card needed to get access to this program
The crisis affected communities are not necessarily only the poor, who are eligible for the program
For workers in the formal sector, health insurance should be covered by the company or covered through Jamsostek (labor social security scheme); but some companies no longer take responsibility for the claims if the workers have been laid off
Furthermore, some Jamsostek members did not know how to make a claim for health services
Impact on Security and Social Lives 
When the crisis was at its peak, some affected villages experienced increases in the rate of crime
For example, in Bekasi the cases of motorcycle and cell phone theft were more frequent, while in Kampar many youth and unemployed were stealing oil palm and rubber lump from the plantation
The increase in crime cases was temporary and it was brought under control through tighter security and policing
In Lombok Barat, the tighter competition among art shops triggered unfair competition, 
with tourist guides directing customers to art shops which paid them high commissions, 
and increased tension between the owners
At the household level, in all affected villages, tension has increased due to economic hardship, but there have been no reports of increases in domestic violence cases
The economic downturn during the crisis has led to a decline in social activities
The frequency of and contribution to arisan (rotary saving and credit group) has dropped in Banjar and Lombok Barat
In Banjar, the participation of the poor in Quran recital groups has also decreased 
because these members are embarrassed that they cannot pay the arisan contribution
In Lombok Barat, the contributions toward building two mosques in the village also decreased to the point that construction has been delayed
In Bekasi, the contributions to a local charity organization that provides assistance to orphans also declined
In at least two of the study villages, the crisis has led to changes in asset ownership
In Bekasi, some small shops which used to be owned by local people have been sold to businesspeople from other districts
In Kampar, some oil palm plantation owners sold part of their land
But the most common phenomenon during the crisis has been that many cars and motorcycles bought on credit have had to be returned to the dealers or leasing companies
In conclusion, the global financial crisis has affected various communities in Indonesia, mainly through exports industries
The most severely affected sectors have been rubber and oil palm plantations; timber and wooden furniture industries; the mining industry; manufacturing, particularly textile and garment industries; as well as automotive and electronic industries; and handicraft industries
Recently, signs of mild recovery have been observed in the rubber and oil palm plantations, the mining industry, and electronic and automotive industries
However, this has not been observed in the timber and wooden furniture, handicraft and textile and garment industries
The GFC has had a limited effect on migrant workers families at home, on tourism, and on fisheries industries
The severity of the effects felt is not uniform, and the poorest in the affected communities have been the most severely impacted by the crisis
In the crisis affected regions, the crisis has also caused tighter competition in the labor market, which is leading to lower wage levels and increasing fraud cases in job placements
The decline in income has not been affecting the consumption of staple foods, but has lowered the level of consumption of protein
The economic hardship has not affected school participation in primary schools and most junior high schools, but has threatened the continuation of schooling at the senior high school level
The health condition of people in study communities has not been significantly affected, although there have been changes in health service seeking behavior
At the community level, the crisis has induced crime and tension among business operators and within households
Participation in social activities is also declining and there have been some changes in asset ownership

Business Climate in NTT
The Case of Agriculture Trade in West Timor
ABSTRACT
Efforts to improve the business climate in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) Province are still facing significant obstacles
Moreover, a healthy business climate is needed to create conditions conducive to hastening development, increasing the employment field, and adding to local revenue
In June-August 2006, SMERU conducted a study of the business climate in NTT, concentrating on four districts and one city in West Timor
The study aims to identify various government policies at the central, provincial, and district/city level, which are directly and indirectly related to market structure, the flow of goods, fee structures, and prices received by producers and traders of agricultural products
The study also examines the impact of various agricultural product charges on provincial and district/city local revenue
The information and data was gathered from various respondents, including producers (farmers, livestock producers, fishermen, and home industry operators); traders (intermediate traders to exporters); as well as relevant government offices and agencies
The main finding of the research is that district/city local governments in West Timor are still attempting to increase local revenue by imposing various charges on the trade of agricultural commodities, although the total charges are currently lower than the period prior to 1997
Forestry products and large livestock (mainly cattle) attract the most charges
The study made several other findings
Firstly, in an effort to avoid a central government regulation that limits the total charges, the NTT local government has endeavored to reinvent charges as third party contributions or administration fees
Secondly, although the impact of official charges on the local budget (APBD) is relatively small, it can trigger the emergence of various unofficial charges, or bribes
Thirdly, agricultural producers generally have small-scale enterprises and weak bargaining powers as selling prices are still determined by several big inter-island traders, thus forming a monopsony environment

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The challenge of creating a business climate that will foster economic growth in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) province is complex
The 2005 Regional Autonomy Watch (KPPOD) report highlighted several problems that constrained the development of business in this region
These include low economic potential, low availability and quality of infrastructure, low productivity of labor and low quality of human capital
as well as problems related to bureaucracy, illegal charges, law enforcement, and local regulations
The central government effort to improve the regional business climate can be traced back to 1997 when the national deregulation reform intended to improve the business climate in Indonesia was first initiated
The deregulation has compelled the elimination of regulations that distort the marketing of agricultural products, and the reduction of various charges
A field study carried out by SMERU in 1998 found that national deregulation had positive impacts on traders and farmers in the rural area of NTT, as it had supported a more transparent and competitive price formation
However, the stipulation of the new law on regional taxes and retribution (Law 34, 2000) has provided more flexibility for district/city governments to initiate taxes, retribution, and levies, and has consequently stimulated the re-emergence of various charges imposed by district/city governments in their efforts to increase local revenue (Pendapatan Asli Daerah - PAD)
This study examines the business climate in the West Timor region of NTT province, which covers Kabupaten Kupang, Kota Kupang, Kabupaten Timor Tengah Selatan (TTS), Kabupaten Timor Tengah Utara (TTU), and Kabupaten Belu
By adopting both qualitative and quantitative approaches, this study specifically looks at how the existing government policies and their implementation affect the market structure, the flow of goods, the cost structure, the price received by farmers and marketing agents of agricultural products, and analyzes the contribution of various charges, particularly from agricultural products, on provincial and district local revenues
This study focused on several important agricultural and agro-industrial products categorized into six sub-sectors
forestry, plantation/cash crops, food crops, animal husbandry, fishery, and agro-industry
This focus was selected because of the importance of agriculture sector to the NTT's economy
This focus was selected as it contributes more than 40% of NTT's GRDP and absorbs more than 80% of its workforce
Thus, facilitating a regulatory environment that is conducive for the marketing and trading of agricultural products, both raw and processed, is crucial for improving the welfare of the farmers, who are predominantly poor, and expanding the economic of the region
SMERU's research team conducted the field study from 19-24 June 2006 and 19 July to 1 August 2006 by interviewing and collecting secondary data from relevant sources, including government officials, producers/farmers and traders
This field study uncovers the following findings
Trade Regulation of Agricultural Products and its Implementation 
(1) This study found several problems related to the socialization and documentation of regional regulations
poor documentation of local regulations, lack of clarity of the type of regulations used, and limited knowledge of government officers at subdistrict level, village staff, and businesspeople regarding the changes to existing formal regulations, procedures and tariffs
(2) This study found no regulation that impedes the entry to the marketing of any agricultural and agro-industrial products
The Governor Instruction number 7, 1993 stipulates a control on the movement and shipment of cattle and the Governor Decree number 5, 2006 regulates the maximum permitted quantity of exportable cattle
However, these regulations have not been enforced, so the traders can ship cattle according to the availability of cattle and the funding to purchase the cattle
(3) The charges on commodities sold for inter-island trade, particularly cattle and various timber and non-timber forestry products as well as plantation products, are more excessive than the charges imposed on food crops and agro-industrial products that are mostly for domestic consumption
The rank of sectors according to the excessiveness of control and regulation (most to least excessive), are forestry products, large livestock (particularly cattle), fisheries, plantation, food crops, and agro-industrial products
The excessive government control on the transport and trading of forestry products is based on Government Regulation Number 34, 2002 and the Decree of the Minister of Forestry Number 126/KPTS-II/2003
The ministerial decree imposed tight control over both timber and non-timber forestry products, and the exploitation of these commodities should be supported by a license to conduct business on the use of forestry products and a license to collect forestry products
The transport of forestry products should be supported with a list of the products as the basis for issuing a Reference Letter on the Legality of Forest Products (SKSHH)
Large livestock, particularly cattle, are the subject of various regulations and excessive charges, starting from the village level
These regulations include the certification of calves, a permit to export large livestock, and quotas for beef cattle exports
The charges imposed include village and kecamatan fees, the third party contribution (Sumbangan Pihak Ketiga - SPK) or retribution for issuing a permit for the import and export of large livestock, retributsi for slaughterhouse services, retribution for livestock market services, fee for livestock health check services, and livestock quarantine
In the fisheries sector, for the purpose of shipping safety, every boat or ship, including fishing vessel, should obtain a shipping permit from the harbormaster each time they go to sea
Owners of large fishing boats (more than 2 gross tonnes) complained about the transparency of permit costs because they have to be obtained through particular agents, who charge almost ten times the formal charge
There is no charge for domestically consumed fish, but some villages still impose a charge on seaweed trading
Plantation and food crops are the least regulated sector and should have been free from any charges since 1998
However, up to the end of 2004, Kabupaten Kupang still imposed retribution for the transport of agricultural products and was removed in early 2005
In Belu, SPK is still charged on these commodities
In addition, these commodities require a quarantine permit when they are to be sent to the outer islands
(4) Most licensing and regulation concerning agricultural products are related to inter-district, inter-island or cross border (export) transportation and trading of the commodities, and they usually involve retribution (user charges), administration costs, or third party contributions
In an effort to comply with the existing national regulations limiting the permissible types of retribution, most charges that were specifically associated with the trading of agricultural and agro-industrial products have been transformed from retribution into third party contributions
Another change is the shift from retribution to administration costs
The coverage and the amount of new charges vary across district/city and across commodities but generally tend to be lower than the period before 1997
Agricultural Product Marketing
(5) Marketplaces in rural areas that operate on a weekly basis have limited role in supporting the inter-island trade of local agriculture products
Most products sold at the weekly market in rural areas are products imported from other regions
Local commodities sold in these marketplaces are mostly raw food products for local consumption
The transaction of most agricultural and agroindustrial products that are exported to other regions, particularly to Surabaya and a lesser extent to South Sulawesi and Bali, usually does not take place in these markets as inter-island traders buy directly from the producers at the farm or in their premises
(6) The marketing of various agricultural products in the West Timor region is characterized by the presence of many small producers with limited marketing power
The presence of middlemen and traders at the village and subdistrict levels has a very limited impact on price formation
The product price is mostly determined by the limited number of inter-island or large traders
They form a natural monopsony market structure
(7) The recent increase in the number of traders and exporters going to Kupang has not fully benefited farmers
This is due to the limited information on product locations, and excessive inspections along the road that increase the amount of informal charges and uncertainty for business operators
The Impact of Regulation on Local Government Revenues and the Business Climate
(8) The contribution of various charges on the agricultural produce trading to regional revenue of the regional budget (APBD) is very small
In addition, it seems that all efforts to increase it have not resulted in any significant increase
On the other hand, there are indications that the increase in charges will have a negative influence on the prices received by farmers and producers
(9) The marketing of agricultural and agro-industrial products is also subjected to informal charges
The types of informal charges include
an extra amount of formal charge, the payment of formal charges that have been eliminated, that can happen due to unclear regulation and bribery intended to smooth the transportation of the goods
(10) The total cost of charges is relatively small compared to the value of the commodities
However, the licensing and regulations have encouraged the imposition of informal charges that disturb the marketing of agricultural products, particularly exportable ones
The excessive inspections and informal charges have increased uncertainty over cost, time of delivery, and law enforcement
This is due to a lack of publicly accessible information regarding licensing procedures and actual charges that is accessible to general public
Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the interest of district/city governments in the West Timor region to generate local revenue by imposing various charges persists, although there have been reductions in the charges imposed on plantation and food crops, and fisheries and agro-industrial products
The contribution of these charges to local government revenues appears to be very small
The regulations and licensing have drawn out informal charges that tarnish the business climate and distort the marketing of exportable agriculture products of the region
This in turn limits the opportunity of farmers to receive better prices and increase of income
As agricultural products are being targeted by many kinds of charges, most of the burden has been transferred to farmers and fishermen, who are predominantly poor
There is a call for a review of the relevant central government regulations, particularly those concerning forestry products and the operation of medium and large fishing vessels
At the very least, local government policies and practices need to be enhanced so that farmers and producers can receive better prices
The following are some recommendations to improve the business climate in West Timor regions
Review existing licensing requirements and regulations to assess whether they really serve the intended objective
This should be associated with the effort to eliminate opportunity for informal charges to be imposed
Formal charges should be directly related to the provision of services
Undertake public dissemination about the removal and changes to licensing/regulations and charges, as well as the existing licensing procedures and the charges
Minimize controls (inspections) and eliminate uncertainty due to informal charges, such as by minimizing the number of checkpoints and placing integrated (multi-sector) checkpoints in strategic locations
Not allowing the involvement of officials who are not in charge
Increase local government and regional legislature knowledge of the difference between retribution, administration fees, and third party contributions
In addition, there is a need to improve the documentation of regulations so that the public can easily access it
Increase market competition by attracting more traders
This could be done by improving existing roads and increasing access to roads, enhancing the role of marketplaces in the marketing of local products by involving the local community and facilitating the development of specific (or seasonal) commodity markets, and publicizing local products to attract buyers from other regions and overseas
I INTRODUCTION
A Background
Creating a favorable business climate is the key for economic growth
For a long time business communities have contested the proliferation of local regulations that create a high cost economy and impose trade and non-trade barriers on business
Many local governments, both at the provincial as well as the district/city levels, collect various taxes and levies to increase their own local revenue (Pendapatan Asli Daerah - PAD) without considering the potential adverse impact on the economic development of the region and the welfare of the community
Some local governments also impose non-revenue raising regulations that distort the market, such as market restrictions, trade quotas, administered prices and specific economic privileges
The central government has created a mechanism to control the creation of distorting local regulations by issuing Law Number 34/2000 and assigning the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Finance to control any local regulations in conflict with this law
However, this has not been fully effective because of the vague definition of good tax' and the limited capacity of the central government to review all local regulations
For the East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) Province, the challenge of creating a business climate that will facilitate economic growth is far more complex
In addition to the low economic potential, the availability and quality of infrastructure such as roads, seaports, and airports, and the quality of human capital are among the issues that inhibit business development
The local government has to create a business climate that is not only favorable for the growth of secondary and tertiary sectors (manufacturing, trade and services) but that will also facilitate the growth of the primary sector, in particular the agriculture sector
NTT's economy relies heavily on agriculture, as this sector contributes more than 40% of the province's GRDP (BPS, 2004)
The majority of NTT's land is used for agricultural purposes such as horticulture, cash crops, food crops, livestock, and forestry
Recently both government and non-government institutions have promoted alternative livelihoods from marine culture, particularly seaweed production
Thus, the local government has a vital role in developing and implementing policies that will facilitate the formation of a regulatory environment that is conducive for the marketing and trading of agricultural products, both raw and processed
Besides improving the welfare of the predominantly poor farmers, these policies are needed to expand the economic development of NTT in general
So far the government, donor community and non-government institutions have endeavoured to support the economic development of NTT
Through supply side assistance, including introducing new farming techniques, new commodities, and credit supports
The results of these efforts have been vary across programs
On the other hand, less attention has been devoted to assessing the condition of the business climate
Such assessment is necessary to develop policy and programs that support a business friendly environment, particularly for small and medium business, by smoothing the marketing of agricultural products and increasing the price received by farmers and producers
B Objectives
This study aims to look at the business climate in NTT, particularly in West Timor, which covers Kabupaten Kupang, Kota Kupang, Kabupaten Timor Tengah Selatan (TTS), Kabupaten Timor Tengah Utara (TTU), and Kabupaten Belu
The focus of this study is to find how existing government policies and their implementation affect market structures, flow of goods, cost structures, and prices received by producers and marketing agents, particularly for primary agricultural products (both raw and processed)
Specifically, this study attempts to
Describe marketing channels and marketing infrastructure of various agricultural products in the West Timor region and identify the factors that determine marketing costs and affect the price received by farmers
Review and examine the rigidity, clarity, consistency, and potential impacts of government policies and regulations at all levels, from central down to village governments, that directly and indirectly affect the market structure, the marketing and flow of agricultural products in the region
Monitor the implementation of regulations concerning market structure, licensing, and charges for tax, retribution, and other informal charges (especially for agricultural and primary commodities) and analyze their impacts on market structure, marketing channels, marketing costs, and the prices received by producers, marketing agents and consumers
Analyze the contribution of various charges (taxes, retribution and other payments) on provincial and district local revenues (PAD), particularly from the trade of both raw and processed agricultural products
C Methodology
This study began in early June 2006
The initial stages involved the literature study and field research preparation
During the preparatory phase of this study, a five-day preliminary study was conducted from 19 to 24 July 2006 in Kota Kupang, Kabupaten Kupang, and Kabupaten TTU
The preliminary study was intended to identify the main issues linked with the business climate and economic development in the West Timor region
During the preliminary study, interviews were conducted with entrepreneurs in the agricultural, manufacturing industry, trade, and transport sectors
In addition, interviews were conducted with several government officials, NGOs, and tertiary education facilities, and visits made to several trading facilities, like the seaports, fishing ports, and markets
The results of the preliminary study were used as input for the main study design, including its main focus
Following this, the field study was carried out from 19 July to 1 August 2006 in Kabupaten Kupang, Kota Kupang, Kabupaten TTS, Kabupaten TTU, and Kabupaten Belu
This study adopted qualitative approaches supplemented by quantitative approaches based on primary data gathered from respondents and secondary data from various sources
Apart from conducting the interviews and collecting secondary data, the research team observed various trading facilities
Respondents and secondary data from relevant government officials at the provincial, district/city and subdistrict levels and from the village administrations, as well as traders, farmers, fishermen, small and medium agro-industries entrepreneurs, truck drivers, and other relevant respondents
All interviews were done using semistructured interview guidelines
The commodities encompassed in this research include primary agricultural products and several agro-industrial products
Most agricultural industries are micro/small scale enterprises
The commodities covered are divided into six subsectors
forestry, plantation/cash crops, food crops, animal husbandry, fisheries, and agro-industry
The list of commodities being investigated is presented in Table 1
The trade of sembako (nine basic food commodities) were included in the main research
Because the results of the preliminary study indicated that the latest developments in the trade of these commodities were quite good and inclined to be beneficial to both small traders and consumers (see Chapter II C for a more detailed discussion)
Although such retail trade is the object of several regulations and charges, the total charges are relatively small compared with the total value of goods, and the collection procedures are not too problematic
Hence, the main research focused on the trade of agricultural products, which is evidently still subject to various regulations and charges
To identify the charges involved in agricultural and agro-industrial trading, the research team followed the trading channels of various commodities, starting from the farmer up to the consumer or inter-island trader
The results of the preliminary study shows that most agricultural products, especially those for inter-island trading, from Kabupaten TTU and Belu are sent via Atambua, whilst agricultural products from TTS and Kupang are sent via Kota Kupang
The research team was therefore split into two
one team examined trading channels from TTU and Belu; and the other team examined trading channels from TTS and Kupang
D Report Structure
This report consists of six chapters
Chapter I introduces the background, objectives, research methodology, and report structure
Chapter II presents a general overview of NTT and the West Timor region, from regional administration aspect, natural conditions and infrastructure, community welfare conditions, and economic conditions, including the developments in the trade sector that were unearthed during the preliminary study
Chapters III to V discuss the results of the study
Chapter III discusses the trade regulations of the various commodities studied, both revenue raising and non-revenue raising
It begins with a discussion on national policies concerning the marketing regulation of agricultural product, followed by an examination of the current regulations
Chapter IV outlines the marketing conditions of agricultural products in West Timor, which are influenced by various central, provincial, district and village level regulations, as well as the availability of trading facilities and infrastructure
Chapter V specifically highlights the impact of regulations and charges for agricultural product marketing on local revenues and the business climate in general
Finally, Chapter VI contains a summary and important observations from the study, and posts some recommendations for local governments
II GENERAL FEATURES OF NTT AND THE WEST TIMOR REGION
A Regional Administration
NTT province consists of 566 islands with a total land area of 47.3 thousand square kilometers
It is estimated that 42 of the islands are populated, while the others generally remain nameless and uninhabited
A large proportion of the NTT inhabitants reside in Flores, Sumba, Timor, and the Alor Islands (Figure 1)
Administratively, the NTT province is divided into 15 districts, one city, and 203 subdistricts
Two districts are located in Sumba Island, eight in Flores and the Lembata and Alor Islands, four districts and one city are located in West Timor, and one district is in the Rote Islands located to the Southwest of Timor
The districts and city located in West Timor are Kabupaten Kupang, Kabupaten TTS, Kabupaten TTU, Kabupaten Belu, and Kota Kupang
The West Timor region, which is directly adjacent to the Democratic Republic of Timor Leste, constitutes 32% of the total NTT area and is inhabited by around 38% of the total population of NTT
Kota Kupang is the provincial capital of NTT
In addition, the city has become the center of trade and financial services in the region, and so has the highest population density in NTT
Kabupaten Kupang surrounds the city
Further to the east is Kabupaten TTS, with its capital Soe; Kabupaten TTU with its capital Kefamenanu; and Kabupaten Belu, with its capital Atambua
Kabupaten Belu is bordered by Timor Leste (Figure 1)
The population figures and administrative profiles of these districts are outlined in Table 2
B Natural Conditions and Infrastructure
The topography of NTT is mountainous and scattered with plains
The climate is generally dry, with the dry season lasting for between eight and nine months of the year, and a wet season extending for only three to four months
Rainfall only reaches more than 3,000 milimeters in a few regions, including Manggarai and Ngada
With these conditions, the proportion of arable land is limited and the productivity of both wet and dry land is low
In the dry season, most of the districts in NTT experience food scarcity, including TTS, TTU, and Belu in West Timor
NTT possesses potential for the livestock and sea-fishing sectors
The vast grassland available for cattle grazing will support the development of the livestock industry
Moreover, the province's large sea area contains a diversity of marine products
The sea area reaches 200 thousand square kilometers, or more than four times its land area with a coastline 5,700 kilometers long
This does not include the Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zone
The island regions' mountainous conditions make communications and transport at the local level difficult, as well as between the islands of NTT and islands outside the NTT region
However, the existing infrastructure has opened access and fulfilled various community needs
Sea transport has a strategic role in NTT
There are 22 seaports equipped with piers, and 12 traditional ports where various sea transport vessels dock regularly
Tenau port in Kota Kupang is the largest seaport, and is of an export standard
The Atapupu port in Kabupaten Belu and the Wini port in Kabupaten TTU are two other large ports in West Timor
For air transportation facilities, besides the El Tari Kupang Airport, there are 13 domestic airports in NTT
One of them is Haliwen Airport in Kabupaten Belu
Though some of them are rarely used
The mainland's mountainous topography is the main challenge for mainland transport in many areas
Road conditions are the main obstacle for the distribution of major agricultural products
The main road extends for 2,900 kilometers, and some parts are badly damaged
Many villages are still difficult to reach
C Human Resources and Community Welfare Conditions
In 2004, the population of NTT comprised of 2,088,156 men and 2,100,618 women
More than 50% of the population is aged between 15 and 55 years, the age group considered to be economically productive (Figure 2)
A large proportion of the population in NTT is dependent on the agricultural sector for their livelihoods
In 2004, approximately 74% of the working-aged population worked in the agricultural sector
This proportion is only slightly lower than 10 years earlier (1994)
The trade sector experienced the largest increase as a source of main employment
While the increase in the manufacturing industry and other services were relatively small
The low quality of human resources and poor community welfare are still big problems in NTT
The Human Development Index (HDI) in NTT is lower than the Indonesian average (Table 3)
The health, educational, and economic conditions of the people of NTT and the studied districts/city are relatively low compared to the average Indonesian
In West Timor, Kota Kupang has relatively high levels of education, health and purchasing power
However, Kabupaten Kupang, TTS, TTU and Belu, have similarly low levels, even below the average of NTT
In addition, the Human Poverty Index (HPI) of NTT is higher than the national average, which indicates the high level of poverty in this province
The HPI indicators also show the extent of the high proportion of malnourished children under five years old, both in NTT generally and across all districts and city in West Timor
The indicators for access to clean water also show the high proportion of the population who do not have access to clean water, especially in TTS
The low welfare levels of the communities in NTT are also reflected in the low per capita Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) figures
The preliminary 2003 figure was only Rp2.2 million, while the GRDP per capita in the four studied districts was less than Rp2.0 million (ranging between Rp1.7 and 1.9 million), far below the Indonesian average which has reached around Rp9.0 million
The poverty rate in NTT is also relatively high (Table 4)
In 2004, there were about 1,152,100 poor people in NTT or around 27.9% of the total number of poor households
About 88% of the poor household heads work in the agricultural sector
Of the four sample districts, Kabupaten TTS has the highest poverty rate at 37.4%
While Kota Kupang has the lowest poverty rate of 10.7%
D Regional Economic Conditions
After the economic crisis and drought that occurred in 1997-1998, the economy of NTT showed steady growth
In 2001 and 2002, NTT's GRDP growth was slightly higher than Indonesia's GDP (Figure 4)
However, the province's economic growth slowed in 2005
Among all the districts and city in West Timor, Kota Kupang experienced the highest economic growth, followed by Kabupaten Kupang
Both areas are business centers and centers for the NTT provincial government
In the past couple of years, Kota Kupang in particular has experienced relatively high growth, mainly from the retail trade sector
Although most land in NTT is not favorable for agricultural business, the economy of this province is still dominated by agricultural sector
The preliminary figures for 2004 show that the agricultural sector contributed 42% of NTT's GRDP, while the manufacturing sector contributed less than 2%
These figures do not vary greatly from the conditions in 1999
Various parties interviewed during the preliminary research were optimistic that the agricultural sector in NTT can be developed
The sectoral composition of districts GRDP in West Timor is not very different from the NTT provincial picture
In Kota Kupang, a large proportion of its GRDP is produced by the other service sector (especially government services), trade, hotel and restaurant, and transport and communications (Table 5)
The major agricultural products of NTT and all the studied districts include cattle, corn, tamarind, candlenut, tubers, nuts, betel nut and coconut
Kabupaten Kupang is the main producer of cattle in NTT
Almost 25% of the NTT's cattle production come from this province
Kabupaten Kupang also produces peanut, mung bean, rice, soya bean, and kapok, as well as fisheries products such as fish, seaweed, squid, and sea cucumber
Significant agricultural products in Kabupaten TTS include cassava, sweet potato, soybean, mung bean, and betel nut
For Kabupaten TTU include peanut and kapok
While in Kabupaten Belu include mung bean, sorghum, tobacco, betel nut, cacao, kapok, coffee, and cashew nut
A large part of the community in West Timor manage their agricultural businesses by cultivating several commodities simultaneously
Apart from planting food crops, they also cultivate plantation crops, gather forest products, raise livestock, and the coastal communities cultivate seaweed or become fishermen
On average, farming households work less than half a hectare of land
Recently, there has been a growing interest of the community in many areas to grow various varieties of vegetables individually or in group plots, although the size of the plots are limited (see Box 1)
In animal husbandry, generally the community only raises one to three large livestock, particularly cattle
In the livestock fattening business, many people are only hired to look after the animals and receive a single payment or commission from the livestock owners
With regard to forest products, primarily tamarind, the community relies on the existing potential offorests
Most of the agro-industries are dependent on family workers and have very limited capital
The palm sugar and coconut oil industries are among the examples of manufacturing industries that are commonly found in communities across all districts in West Timor
Some villages have become production centers for these two industries, particularly in TTS (see Box 2 and Box 3)
Although the agricultural sector still makes the largest contribution to the NTT and West Timor GRDP, the relative contribution of this sector is continuing to fall, as growth for the sector over the last few years has been lower than total economic growth
The decline in the agricultural sector's contribution is compensated by an increase in the proportion of contributions from the trade, hotel and restaurant sectors, and the transport and communications sectors
In NTT, the trade sector is the third largest contributor to GRDP at around 6 to 16%
The increasing importance of this sector is reflected in an increase in the proportion of the sector's workforce, as suggested in the discussion of human resources (Figure 3, page 7)
The development of the trade sector in Kota and Kabupaten Kupang can be observed from the development of various trade infrastructures, both in the form of ruko (a shop with attached residence) and shopping centers
In addition, especially in Kota Kupang, the total number of operators in the supply and distribution of daily necessities is rising
Since 1999, a minimum of three new large wholesalers of various consumer needs have been operating in Kota Kupang
Generally the new traders had been trading in East Timor before it split from Indonesia
Most major operators are supported by agents or shops located in each district in West Timor and a strong network of suppliers
They give better service to small shop owners in the West Timor region as a strategy to penetrate and secure that particular market segment
Several distributors even employ sales representatives who go to the shops and small stalls to send and receive orders
Based on the interviews conducted in the preliminary study, most wholesalers of daily necessities declare they do not face obstacles when obtaining trade permits or when distributing their goods
According to them, there are no formal or informal charges for distributing goods, with the exception of alcoholic beverages
Most food and nonfood goods come from Surabaya by ship
The daily and weekly markets, kiosks, and small stalls in remote villages have an important role in the distribution and marketing of various types of community needs
A frequently mentioned obstacle for business development is the low purchasing power of the community, especially in rural areas
Because of this, business operators have recently sought products that are relatively inexpensive and within reach of the community
In NTT, especially in West Timor, the annual monitoring study by the Regional Autonomy Watch (KPPOD, 2005), reported several factors that impeded business development
Based on the perception of several sample business operators and relevant secondary data, the 2005 KPPOD report highlighted some problems related to bureaucracy, illegal charges, law enforcement, and local regulations that restrain the development of business in this region (see Table 6 and Appendix 3)
III TRADE REGULATION OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION
A National Deregulation Policy and Local Government Responses
1. 1997-1999
The development of the business climate in NTT cannot be separated from various national level policies
In 1997, the Government of Indonesia (GoI) replaced Law Number 11 Drt, 1957 on General Regulation of Regional Taxes, and Law No 12 Drt, 1957 on General Regulation of Regional retribution, with Law No 18, 1997 on Regional Taxes and retribution
This amendment aimed to reduce high cost economies and create a better business climate in Indonesia by creating a simpler, fairer, more effective, and efficient charging system
The new law significantly limited the types of taxes and retribution that could be charged by provincial and district/city governments
Then, on 15 January 1998, the GoI signed a Letter of Intent (LoI), which affirmed the government's commitment to improve the business climate by eliminating regulations that distort the marketing of agricultural products and by reducing the level of charges
Following on from this, the GoI stipulated Presidential Instruction (Inpres) Number 1, 1998 on the Prohibition to Charge Exportable Goods, and Inpres Number 2, 1998 on Inter-Provincial, Inter-District and Inter-Island Trade
The Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHa) also issued Instruction Number 9, 1998 on the Prohibition to Charge Exportable Goods, and the Removal of the Ban on Inter- Provincial, Inter-Districts, and Inter-Islands Trade; and Instruction Number 10, 1998 on the Removal of Provincial and District Regulations about Regional Taxes and retribution (Mawardi and Usman, 1998)
Responding to the new central government policy, the provincial government of NTT circulated Governor Instruction Number 1, 1998 to all Bupati and Walikota (Mayor), which demanded
The removal of local regulations on charges and retribution on commodities to be exported and traded to other districts and islands
The removal of Bupati/Walikota decrees regarding the ban on the export and inter-districts and inter-island trade of goods and commodities
The prohibition of any policies regulating marketing procedure on goods and commodities in all districts/cities
A field study carried out in 1998 (Mawardi and Usman, 9) found that the 1997/1998 deregulation had positive impacts on traders and farmers in the rural areas of NTT
The traders and farmers had eagerly commented that it was the era of free trade, in the sense that there were no more government officials disrupting their businesses
The early implementation stage of Law Number 18, 1997 resulted in the removal of 30 regional taxes and 26 regional retribution at the district/city level in West Timor
As a result, this supported a more transparent and competitive price formation (Mawardi and Usman, 1998)
The results of SMERU's study Regional Trade Deregulation, Impact to the Local Economy and Lessons Learned in 18 Kabupaten/Kota carried out in 13 provinces
It showed that after deregulation the proportion of prices received by farmers increased, agricultural commodities trade became more competitive, and the obstacles faced during products delivery decreased
The results of the analysis on 36 sample cases comprised of 20 agricultural commodities showed that after the deregulation, the proportion of the final price received by farmers increased by an average of 9%
The margins enjoyed by farmers was higher than those enjoyed by trader (Usman et al, 1999)
2000-Now
In 2000, the GoI amended Law Number 18/1997 and issued Law 34/2000
This adjustment was part of the new policy of administrative and financial decentralization that transferred significant government functions to the district/city level
The new law provides more flexibility to distrit/city governments to initiate new taxes and retribution as long as they meet certain predetermined criteria
In its implementation, many articles in Law 34/2000 were considered to be unclear
(A comparison of the main points in Law No 18/1997 and Law No 34/2000 is outlined in Appendix 2.) 
The major change in intergovernmental relations started in 2001, and has stimulated the reemergence of various charges imposed by district/city governments in their efforts to increase local revenue
Although fewer numbers and types of commodities were subjected to charges than before the issuance of Law Number 18, 1997, this trend raised many concerns
Responding to this probelm, the central government assigned the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) to review and withdraw any distorting local regulations
This mechanism, however, has not been fully effective due to the vague definition of good tax contained in the existing law and regulations, and the limited capacity of the central government to review all local regulations
Nevertheless, as of 2 March 2006, the MoHA had required the removal of some 506 local regulations, nationwide (Depdagri, 2006)
This study also uncovered the reemergence of some types of the old charges in West Timor, even though the formal licensing regulations abolished these charges
In an effort to comply with the existing national regulations that limit the permissible types of retribution, charges that were particularly associated with the trading of agricultural and agro-industrial products have mostly been changed from retribution to third party contributions (sumbangan pihak ketiga - SPK or SP3) or to administration fees
The formal legal base for the imposition of SPK is the MoHA Regulation Number 8, 1978 on the Receipt of Third Party Contributions by the Head of the Region
These changes are confusing and misleading
Despite the different meaning of retribution, SPK, and administration fees, these terms are used interchangeably in various local regulations
In some cases, the amount of SPK being charged is set unilaterally or through an agreement with a limited number of businesspersons
While the administration fees are calculated based on the quantity of the traded commodities
This violates the general rules of SPK, which state that third party contributions should be voluntary and not obligatory
As well as the rules of administration fees, which are determined based on the type and quantity of services and not the quantity of the commodities
The coverage and the amount of new charges vary across districts/city and across commodities, but they are generally more limited than before the existence of Law Number 18, 1997
Most licenses and charges for the trade of forestry commodities, livestock, and fisheries are still in effect
While the charges related to the trading of plantation products and food crops in particular have been removed in some districts
Nevertheless, information regarding the elimination of these charges has not been widely disseminated
This study tries to explore and list the various regulations that influence business and trade of agricultural products in West Timor
The results of the investigation will be discussed in the following subchapter and are summarized in Appendix 6
It should be noted that the results are not as complete as expected because of several technical difficulties experienced when collecting the necessary information and data (Box 4)
Apart from affecting the comprehensiveness of this report, the problems experienced when collecting documents and information concerning the various regulations at the regional level also reflects weak administration and socialization of the local regulations
B Regulations on Agricultural Product Marketing in West Timor
In general, this study found no regulations that directly control or restrain the marketing structure of specific agricultural and agro-industrial products in West Timor region
Regulations that specifically limit commodity trade are only found in the livestock sector
These regulations are imposed to curb the spread of livestock disease and increase livestock numbers
They will be outlined in the subsection regarding livestock commodities
Most of the regulations in effect at the district/city level are developed based on national and/or provincial regulations
The national regulations in effect are usually reaffirmed by local regulations or governor, bupati, and walikota decree/instruction , or decree of the head of the relevant office
As a result, most regulations are of a similar form across the regions
The main differences can only be seen in the stipulations of the tariff/fee amount for the service/license rendered
Many of the various regulations in effect in the region regulate business and trade licensing
These regulations can be divided into two categories
general regulations on business and trade; and regulations for specific businesses and trading of specific commodities
1 General Regulations on Business and Trade
All districts and cities in the study area applied similar business licensing requirements for general trading and manufacturing industry, by referring to Department of Trade and Industry regulations
The licensing requirements include
(a) All types of businesses should have a License for Business Location ; (b) General traders should have a License for Trade Business ; (c) Manufacturing industry should have a License for Manufacturing Business  and Certificate of Manufacturing Registration ; (d) Businesses that have a warehouse should have a Certificate of Warehouse Registration; (e) All formal enterprises should be registered and have a Company Register 
Local regulations regarding licensing of business/trade and industry generally still refer to old regional and central regulations
In Kota Kupang for example, local licensing regulations were introduced in 2001
In Kabupaten TTS, local regulations regarding trading business permits were introduced in 2002
With reference to new central regulations, Kabupaten TTU is currently preparing a draft Local Regulation on Guidelines for Issuing Permits and Registration in the Trade Sector
This will regulate all forms of licensing in the trade sector in TTU
In almost all regions, the stipulation regarding this business licensing only applies to large and medium scale enterprises, while small or micro enterprises are generally not required to have permits
All of these licenses and certificates should be renewed regularly
The validity period for each license type is usually similar for all districts/city
But, there are permits with different validity periods
For example, in some regions, the SIUP is valid for as long as the company exists
But there are also regions that set its validity period for five years
The SITU is five years, but the SPK should be paid every year
The TDP is generally only valid for three years
Most operators (traders/shop owners) consider the processes and tariffs to be quite reasonable, so they do not raise any complaints
From the perspective of the importance to local governments, licensing is intended not only to provide order to the administration of documentation of various businesses in the region, but also to increase local revenue
Local governments usually impose SPK when formulating licensing requirements
In order to increase local revenue, TTU and other districts took the initiative to require SITU for all businesses in their area- including small kiosks
2 Agricultural Product Trade Regulations
Generally, all licensing and regulation of agricultural products are concerned with the inter- districts and inter-islands or cross-border (export) transportation and trading of the commodities
Each regulation and license imposes charges in the forms of retribution, administration fees, or SPK into effect
While the central government has limited the type of commodities that may be levied, there is a tendency for provincial and district/city governments to continue their efforts to collect charges as a source of local revenue
Local governments merely change the term retribution to retribution to cover administration costs or to SPK
These changes are generally determined by decree of the regional head that has less legal standing than perda
The list of regulations in various sectors is outlined in Appendix 6
In addition to the charges at the district level, the village and subdistrict administrations also impose charges on several commodities that are sold or sent to other village (Box 5)
The village is the lowest autonomous region that has the authority to arrange their own income and expenditure, and charges are one source of village income
All legal village charges must be recorded in village regulations and approved by the district administration
Besides retribution, a village also receives funds from district budget in the form of Village/Kelurahan Development Funds (Dana Pembangunan Desa/Kelurahan - DPDK)
In Kabupaten TTS, for example, the value of DPDK funds is set at Rp10 million/village/year
The DPDK funds are allocated for infrastructure development, procurement of office stationery, and village officials' operational costs
In terms of expenditure, a village's operational costs are not low
Besides having to pay electricity bills and finance various village activities (including meetings with community members), a village also has to finance its official's routine travel expenses for regular trips (at least once a week) to the subdistrict and district offices
For villages located far from the subdistrict/district office, this expense can be Rp50,000 for a round trip
In general, the charges on commodities sold for inter-island trade, particularly cattle and various timber and non-timber forestry products as well as plantation products, are more excessive than the charges on food crops and agro-industrial products
The rank of sectors from the most regulated to the least regulated ones, are
forestry products, large livestock, fisheries, plantation, food crops, and agro-industrial products
An analysis of the respective sectors follows
Forestry Commodities
The excessive regulations and charges on forestry products stems from the Government Regulation (PP) Number 34, 2002 on the Forest Management and the Formulation of Forest Management Plans, Forest Utilization and the Use of Forest Estate, which stated that in an effort to protect government rights over forestry products and forest sustainability, the government shall control the traffic and the trading of forestry products
This was supported by the Decree of the Minister of Forestry No 126/KPTS-II/2003 on the Management of Forest Products, which stated that permission from the Department of Forestry must be obtained for the utilization of forest products, and that a Reference Letter on the Legality of Forest Products (SKSHH) should accompany the transportation of forestry products
The SKSHH application from the NTT Provincial Forestry Office lists many prerequisites that business operators and traders of forestry products must fulfill before the permit is issued (Box 6)
However, in practice business operators are not always required to fulfill every requirement and follow official procedure in order to obtain the permit
These conditions give rise to the emergence of collusion and informal charges
The fiercest complaint regarding the forestry product trading procedure is the uncertain availability of the SKSHH forms, which can delay the transport of products for an unknown period of time
Traders, particularly inter-island traders, may experience losses due to the delay in shipment and a failure to fulfill trading contracts with trading partners in Surabaya
Traders are also unwilling to transport the products without an SKSHH due to the likelihood of excessive penalties (informal charges) at inspection posts
Transporters of forestry products are obliged to pay additional SPK charges when the SKSHH is issued
The actual amount of the contribution varies between districts/cities
In TTU, for example, Local Regulation No 20/1998 on SPK is an agreement between the Forestry Office and four business representatives over the SPK amount signed in 2005
The regulation stipulates that the SPK charged depends on the type and volume of forest products
The Kabupaten Belu local government determined SPK with a similar agreement
In addition to SPK, some villages impose charges for various types of timber and non-timber products
The formal charges account for roughly 3.5-5.5% of the final price for timber, and 0-2.5% of the selling price of tamarind and candlenut in Surabaya
The procedures for felling and transporting timber are more rigid and complicated due to the imposition of Presidential Instruction Number 4, 2005 on the Suppression of Illegal Timber
This regulation is meant to eliminate illegal logging
But, it has not been fully applied as it is difficult to determine whether the timber being traded is illegal or originates from community owned land
As a result, the regulation and inspection of transported timber products also applies to timber felled from community owned land
The presidential instruction clarifies the involvement of security institutions or the police in the law enforcement of illegal timber
In the field, the police dominate the inspections on trucks transporting timber and other forest products
A new stipulation on the exploitation and accumulation of timber and nontimber products has recenty been released as a follow up to the Presidential Instruction No 4/2005
This imposed that every business, individual, and cooperation active in the timber or non-timber forestry product sector should obtain a permit to use and accumulate forestry products from the government under the following conditions
(1) Business permits for the use of timber up to 50 cubic meters and non-timber up to 100 tonnes are to be issued by the head of the district/city forestry office upon recommendation by the bupati/walikota
(2) Business permits for the use of timber from 51-100 cubic meters and non-timber products from 101-200 tonnes to be issued by the head of the Provincial Forestry Office upon recommendation by the bupati/walikota and a technical review by the head of the district/city forestry office
(3) Business permits for the use of timber over 100 cubic meters and non-timber products over 200 tonnes are to be issued by the governor upon recommendation by the bupati/walikota and a technical review by the head of the district/city forestry office
Business operators are concerned with this troublesome procedure and the amount of the charges to be paid
Local regulations regarding the use of sandalwood are still in effect in TTS, TTU and Belu
Sandalwood trees are almost exhausted, and it is widely belived that this commodity is extinct in West Timor
The regulations imposed in each district are similar, and require permits and recommendations for the exploitation of sandalwood
Recommendation from the relevant local government or forestry office must be obtained for sandalwood felling, transporting, selling and processing
An SKSHH is also required for the transport of sandalwood, and charges are imposed on the sale of sandalwood
The community is still reluctant to replant sandalwood even though it has a high economic value, as they are concerned that the local government will appropriate the trees when they are fully-grown
Most people are not aware of the changes in regulations regarding sandalwood ownership
b Livestock Commodities
The trade of large livestock (cattle, horse, and buffalo) has subject to various regulations and excessive charges from the village level up to the district level (see Table 7)
This study also came across two regulations in NTT that seek to limit the trade of livestock commodities, especially beef cattle
(1) The Governor Instruction No 7, 1993 on the Implementation of the Prevention and Elimination of Brucellosis (a contagious disease causing still births), which supplements Governor Decree No 13, 1993 on Directives for the Prevention and Elimination of Brucellosis in NTT Province
These instructions stipulate controls on the movement and shipment of cattle in order to prevent the spread of brucellosis disease
Cattle from TTU and Belu are not permitted to enter TTS and Kupang
Although this regulation has not been removed, it is no longer forcefully imposed, so some cattle from TTS are shipped from Atapupu and some from TTU are shipped from Kupang
This regulation is also not effective in controlling the movement of calves and cattle for domestic consumption
Calves from TTU and Belu are sold in the cattle markets in Kupang
(2) Governor Decree No 5, 2006 on Export Allocations for Slaughtered Large Livestock (beef cattle, buffalo and horse) in 2006, aims to limit the total number of livestock exports to ensure the sustainability of the livestock industry (See Box 7)
The provincial government also set minimum weight standards for large livestock
Bali cattle from Timor, 275 kg; Sumba Ongole cattle, 350 kg; buffalo, 350 kg; and horse 250 kg
However, in practice this regulation is difficult to enforce
Traders in all districts send as many head as they are able, 
The total number of livestock shipped to outer islands, especially cattle, usually exceeds the provincial regulation allocation (Table 8)
The NTT Perda No 13/2003 on retribution for the Payment of Administration Cost concerns licensing procedures and the imposition of charges
The services covered by these charges involve
livestock product export quality certification, health certification, large livestock calf certificate, large livestock export/transport permit, and livestock export and import recommendation
The large livestock export/transport permit and large livestock calf certificate attract tariffs as high as Rp20,000/head, while other administration service fees attract fees between Rp10,000 and Rp50,000 per certificate or permit
The fees for the large livestock export permit and the health certificate (Table 7) are collected by the district/city and then divided, with 30% going to the province and 70% going to the district/city
In Kabupaten Kupang, retribution tariffs and decisions regarding the sharing of funds are unclear, as there is no agreement between the district and the province
As outlined in Table 7, the Kabupaten Kupang Animal Husbandry Office only charges SPK of Rp5,000/head for large livestock inter-island trade
Almost all inter-island traders of large livestock consider retribution for livestock export/transport permits as SPK
The export and import of livestock in Kabupaten TTU and Belu also attract a holding ground fee
The livestock holding yard is provided by the district government, and is separated from the livestock quarantine
In Kabupaten Kupang and Belu there is also a charge for the health inspection
In Kabupaten Kupang, which has the only large livestock market in Timor Island, traders who buy livestock from the market pay retribution calculated based on the type of livestock
adult cattle and buffalo attract a fee of Rp12,000 per head while cattle and buffalo calves attract a fee of Rp7,500 per head
The Kota Kupang local government enacted a permit to raise livestock, which is intended to maintain hygiene standards, protect the environment, and protect other general interests, including sources of local revenue
Another regulation was enacted to give all district/city governments the authority to impose slaughterhouse charges and retribution
The quarantine and seaport regulation refers to the Government Regulation (PP) and Agriculture Minister Decree
Central government officials based in the region render the services
The tariffs for quarantine services are determined in PP No 7, 2004, on Changes to Tariffs on Non- Tax Government Revenue
The port arrangements are the task of shipping companies that are paid by inter-island livestock traders
In this way, the port head or harbormaster is the extension of the Department of Communications and Transport assigned to monitor freighter and passenger ship traffic (through docking permits) as well as the loading and unloading of goods
This study also shows the existence of charges (retribution) to fund local government services in accordance with the regulations, even if the service is not provided
Several charges, like the holding ground (livestock receiving yard) service fee in TTU and Belu, the health inspection fee, and quarantine fee in Atapupu, are charged although the local government or government do not provides any services
A large number of village/kelurahan administrations in the West Timor region also enforce charges (leges) for the trade of large livestock, which vary between Rp5,000 and Rp25,000 per head
These village administration fees cover the cost of issuing ownership and origin certificates
These certificates are required by traders to prove that the livestock they are trading is legal and not stolen
Several villages also impose a charge for small livestock (pigs and goats) and poultry owned by the community that will be sold in the market
Fishery Commodities
In the fisheries sector, fishing vessels and fisheries businesses are subjected to various licensing requirements and regulations imposed by the central and provincial governments, as well as district/city administrations
The following regulations apply to fishing vessels
(1) All fishing boats should follow regulations concerning boat safety and navigation under the authority of the Ministry of Transportation, particularly the ministry appointed harbormasters
Vessel owners are required to arrange the following documents through the harbormaster
letter of vessel size or gross certificate, safety certificate, annual pass, and a shipping permit (SIB)
For the purpose of shipping safety, every boat or ship, should obtain an SIB from the harbormaster each time they go to sea
Owners of large fishing boats (more than 2 gross tonnes) complain about the transparency of the cost to obtain the permit
Owners cannot go direct to the harbormaster, but instead have to obtain the permit through specific agents
The official tariff for SIB is Rp15,000, however agents impose a tariff of Rp150,000
In addition, a recommendation from the Provincial Fisheries Office costing Rp100,000 is a prerequisite to obtain an SIB
Due to the high cost of arranging the SIB, many fishermen ship without it and risk being caught by the Navy or Water Police
(2) Boat owners also require a fishing permit to operate fishing vessels
The authority to issue fishing permits lies with the central, provincial or district/city level administration, depending on the size of the vessel
Fishing permits for boats under 10 gross tonnes (GT) can be obtained from the district/city Fishery and Marine Office; for boats of 10-35 GT from the provincial office; and more than 35 GT from the central government
The provincial and district/city administrations have local regulations pertaining to fisheries business licensing
In connection with the sea border authorities between Kota and Kabupaten Kupang, business operators and vessel owners complain that they must have two permits for the same purpose
Apart from regulating permits to catch fish, some local regulations require other permits for fisheries businesses to buy and harvest, transport, and process fisheries products
At the provincial level, the fee to obtain these permits, which was initially called retribution' has been changed to administration fee' as required by Local Regulation No 13, 2003
Other provincial regulations regarding fisheries are
(1) Local Regulation No 11, 2001 on The Use of Regional Resources, which stipulates the fee for inter-island fisheries product quality inspection (the amount is stipulated in Governor Regulation No 12, 2005);
(2) Local Regulation No 1, 2003 on Initial Changes to Local Regulation No 12, 2001 on Port Services retribution
(3) Local Regulation No 13, 2001 on Fishing Vessel Inspections
In some areas, small fishing boats that moor at the traditional port are not charged with retribution because the formal fisheries auction site has not been operating
However, fishermen owning small fishing boats reveal that they are levied with retribution of Rp60,000/year in TTU and Rp25,000/year in Belu by the local Fishery and Marine Office
In Belu, the head of the fishermen's group collects the retribution payments, while in TTU, the payment is individually lodged by the fishermen
The trading of fish for local consumption is not subject to any charge
But those sold for export to other islands or other countries are subject to SPK, a quarantine permit, and quality control certification
However, traders generally do not complain about the licensing and charges imposed by the fishery office because the procedure is considered to be quite simple and the total cost of charges are also reasonable
The traders of seaweed, like the traders of any other fish products, have to obtain a permit from district/city fishery office to buy and collect fishery products
A letter from the quarantine office should accompany seaweed exports
In Kupang, up until 2004 traders had to pay the village administration Rp100/kilogram for dry seaweed purchases
This charge has now been removed
Plantation and Food Crop Commodities
The plantation and food crop sector is the least regulated sector and should have been free from any charges since 1998
Nevertheless, in practice charges are still imposed on these commodities, for example
Kabupaten Kupang only removed in early 2005
Although this retribution has been abolished, several traders of plantation products, for example cashew traders, have asked for certificates from the subdistrict administration as they are scared they will be checked by officials or police during the journey
In Belu, these commodities are still charged with SPK based on Bupati Decree No 142/HK/2004
Local government still requires a permit for the export of agricultural produce to outside the region in accordance with the effective stipulations regarding licensing, and payment of SPK is a prerequisite for obtaining the permit
The Economics Division of Kabupaten Belu Local Government now handles licensing and SPK payments, instead of the relevant Food Crop and Plantations Office
However far less commodity types attract SPK now than before the 1997 deregulation
In TTU, local regulations concerning permits for the export of food crops and plantation products to other regions are no longer in effect
However, in practice there are still business operators and traders who sell their products outside the region, who ask the office for a permit to protect them if there are road inspections
Agencies provide this service in accordance with the business operators requests, and do not charge the relevant formal fee
However, the business operators and traders who ask for the permit usually voluntarily give the official money as recompense
These commodities only require a quarantine permit if they will be sent to the outer islands
Agro-Industrial Products
Regulations for the agro-industrial product industry involve general business permits as covered in subchapter B.1
In almost all areas, however, small and micro agroindustrial enterprises and home industries are not required to have such permits
In TTU, the production and trade of sopi (an alcoholic beverage made from palm sap) requires an alcoholic beverages vendor permit (Local Regulation No 22, 1998)
The study findings show that the process to obtain this permit is flexible and does not consistently adhere to the local regulation
The procedure to obtain a permit differs between villages
In a production center of sopi in TTU, sopi producers and traders go to the village office and the village head collectively arranges the permit through the Kabupaten TTU Local Revenue Office
After the permission letters have been processed, an official from the Local Revenue Office goes to the village to dispense them and collect retribution up to Rp60,000/year
In another village, the license is collectively given to six producers with a four-month validity period
IV AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT MARKETING
A Marketing Channels and the Role of the Market in Agricultural Product Marketing
Most agricultural and agro-industrial products that are traded to other regions go to Surabaya and to a lesser extent South Sulawesi and Bali
Table 9 presents a summary of marketing destinations for agricultural commodities and some processed products
Cattle, tamarind, candlenut, cashew nut, and seaweed are among the products sold to other islands in relatively large quantities
Horse, peanuts, mung bean, teak, honey and other non-timber forestry products are sold in lesser quantities
Tuna, shark fin, sea cucumber, and oranges are also exported to other regions
Most agro-industrial products, including coconut oil, brown sugar, various processed beef, salted/dried fish, and eucalyptus oil, as well as various food crops and fish are usually for local consumption
The marketing chains of various products are presented in Appendix 4
Weekly markets in rural areas support the trading economy of this region
The relatively large weekly markets are mostly located in subdistrict capitals and can be accessed by communities from several villages/kelurahan, both those within or outside the respective subdistrict
Only one or two large markets in the district/city capitals are open every day
The total number of markets recorded by each district/city government are outlined in Table 10
All daily markets and some weekly markets managed by the district/city government provide open space and simple permanent stalls
However local traders do not use the stalls in some markets, as they prefer to sell in the open space or make their own simple stalls in locations they consider easier to reach by consumers
The district/city governments via the revenue office (Dinas Pendapatan Daerah) charge traders or farmers who sell in the market a market retribution in most marketplaces
Some small community run village markets are exempt from this practice and usually have a voluntary contribution system
Markets with potential as a source of local revenue are generally managed directly by the district/city government authority via the local revenue office and are not delegated to the subdistrict or village/kelurahan authority
Hence the subdistrict and village/kelurahan authorities are not authorized to monitor the market operations
In local government managed markets, officials from the local revenue office collect retribution with the assistance of subdistrict staff
In Kabupaten Kupang, the subdistrict receives a share of the revenue from market retribution, while in Belu and TTU the subdistrict does not receive any retribution revenue; only a subdistrict official (usually a non-permanent civil servant) directly involved in the collection receives a small fee
This kind of market management is ineffective and highlights the need for an improvement in market facility management practices, including a need for the involvement of the local community
The type of goods sold indicates that the main role of the weekly market is to provide various necessities to the local community
Direct observation found that weekly markets and daily markets mainly sell groceries, clothes, kitchen utensils and electronics for local consumption
In general, outsiders supply almost 80% of the goods sold in the weekly market
Local people from the respective subdistrict and neighboring subdistricts supply the rest of the goods
Local products are generally sold for local consumption, mostly vegetables, fruits, sweet potato, cassava, corn, rice, nuts, coconut oil, small livestock (pigs, goats, and chickens), and various home made food
Only very limited quantities of local produce are bought by traders, particularly bananas, vegetables, tubers, chicken, and pigs, for sale in other (usually larger) markets or in small kiosks lining the main road
Almost all products exported to other islands are not traded in the markets, as interisland traders usually go direct to the villages
Some farmers residing near the district/city capital take their produce directly to shops and large traders
During the peak harvest period (see Table 11) some farmers take their produce to the market to sell to the traders, but the transaction usually takes place outside the marketplace
Kabupaten Belu is bordered by Timor Leste, and is a border crossing trading route
Since the security problem arose in the border area in 2003, there has been no cross border trade in the three markets of Motaain, Turiskain and Metamaut
The Kabupaten Belu government is still waiting for orders and policies from the central government to reactivate these markets
Before the shootings, traders from Indonesia usually took groceries to Timor Leste and brought back agricultural products, particularly coffee, tamarind, cacao, watermelon and cashew nut
However, the crossborder traders revealed the many charges that were imposed both in Indonesia and in Timor Leste (Table 12)
Traders had to set aside as much as Rp1 million each crossing to pay the charges
B Market Structure and Price Determination
The marketing of various agricultural products in the West Timor region is characterized by the presence of many small producers with limited marketing power, and fewer numbers of intermediate traders at village, subdistrict, and district levels
This study found no government regulation that specifically restricts the marketing of agricultural products and directly creates monopoly or monopsony powers for certain traders or business operators
However, there are only a few inter-island traders, with the exception of inter-island cattle traders
Only two dominant inter-island traders are based in Atambua, and a larger numbers are based in Kupang
These monopsony structures are naturally formed by the relatively isolated conditions, the limited quantity of produce, and established business connections with trading partners in Surabaya, the main export destination for almost all West Timor's raw products
There is a relatively new trend of increasing numbers of business operators going to Kupang from other regions such as Surabaya, Jakarta, and Denpasar, or even from other countries, to buy local produce
The rise in the frequency of flights to and from Kupang has positively impacted the marketing of local products
The rise in the frequency of flights increase the number of buyers and traders
The presence of new buyers increased the price of several commodities
However, most producers have not enjoyed these increases due to limited product and price information, poor road infrastructure in some regions, and excessive illegal levies
These all act as disincentives for farmers and small traders to take their commodities directly to Kupang
Farmers are free to choose buyers and sometimes compare the prices offered by more than one buyer
However, in almost all cases traders dominate the product price determination
Farmers are forced to sell their produce immediately in order to fulfill their families daily needs
This weakens their ability to determine their selling price
Long distances to the market and their relatively limited amount of produce also lower the farmers bargaining position (See Box 9)
Intermediate traders usually offer similar prices for cattle and other export products bought direct from producers, as they use the price determined by inter-districts and inter-island traders as a reference
This in turn influences the price determined by buyers in the destination market, mostly Jakarta and Surabaya
Several transaction practices in West Timor cause losses to farmers and producers
(1) Ijon, or a system of selling produce before the harvest period
This is evident particularly in the orange plantations in TTS
These producers sell their products before they are harvested, either intentionally because it is easier for the farmer or because of the higher bargaining power of traders
Prices for this practice are determined via a bargaining process that estimates the quantity of the harvest
(2) Some intermediate traders offer a relatively high price, almost the same as the price offered by the large and inter-island traders, but we suspect that they manipulate the weighting so that the price received by farmers is actually low
These practices cause great losses to farmers and producers and are fraudulent
These claims are backed up by some intermediate traders, who stated that they must be clever by reducing the recorded weight of the produce so they do not suffer a loss
There are two types of intermediate traders
those who own their own capital or those who use capital from large traders
In many cases, the intermediate traders use capital from large traders and only act as an intermediary between the seller and the large trader
In this case, they receive a wage, commission, or share of the profits
These intermediate traders primarily purchase agricultural commodities such as large livestock, timber, tamarind, and candlenut
There are intermediate traders at the village and subdistrict levels
Generally, village intermediate traders deal directly with large traders at the district level
However, some transactions do occur between village and subdistrict intermediate traders
In almost all cases, inter-island traders usually determine prices based on the information from or contract with their trading partners
Thus, the trading partners determine the price of exported products
The benefit received by farmers and producers and their bargaining position can be measured by comparing the farm gate price to the final selling price of their respective commodities
A rough estimate based on information provided by farmers and traders in West Timor shows that the proportion of the final selling price received by farmers varies between commodities and trading modalities (see Appendix 5)
In the case of cattle, farmers who sell calves and receive payment for fattening only command around 40% of the selling price in Jakarta
This price is much lower than the 70% received by farmers who sell large cattle ready for slaughter (see Box 10)
In the cases of processed sea cucumber and shark fin, fishermen receive around 50% of the Kupang selling-price
This is due to the informal contract fishermen usually have with traders, to whom they owe ship operational costs
Seaweed farmers receive more than 85% of the Surabaya selling-price
The presence of a foreign company, for the Shanghai seaweed processing industry, has increased product prices
Tamarind farmers receive around 60% of the Surabaya price or around 80% of the Kupang price and around 75% of the Atambua price
Candlenut farmers receive around 75% of the Surabaya price or around 85% of Kupang and Atambua prices
The Atambua price is slightly lower than the Kupang price for both tamarind and candlenut, as the Kupang market is more competitive
V THE IMPACT OF CHARGES ON LOCAL REVENUE AND THE BUSINESS CLIMATE
A Impacts on Local Government Revenue
One of the main motivations for the local government to enforce charges for the trade of agricultural products is to raise local revenue (PAD), one source of the regional contribution to the regional budget (APBD)
The value of the APBD is constantly increasing at both the provincial and district/city levels
For the 2004/2005 fiscal year in particular, the NTT Province's APBD increased by around 6.5%
The same applies at the district/city level where Kota Kupang experienced the highest increase in the APBD at about 8.7%, while Kabupaten TTU experienced the lowest increase, at 3.5% (Table 13)
The increase in the planned 2006 APBD of the province and four district is expected to be higher than the previous year
The contribution of PAD to provincial APBD exceeds 20%
Between 2004 and 2005, provincial PAD increased in nominal and percentage terms to APBD
In 2006, however, the percentage of PAD to APBD is expected to decline in line with a predicted increase in equalization funds received by the province, although in absolute terms, the value of PAD will still rise
DAU (General Allocation Funds) are the main source of revenue for the NTT Province, contributing more than 60%
In 2006, the contribution of equalization funds to the provincial APBD is predicted to reach 72.1% with a revenue target of Rp513.6 billion (Rp470.4 billion from DAU), or an increase of 47% compared to the preceding year
Local taxes are the main source of provincial PAD and contribute more than 60%, while local fees and charges only contribute around 14% (Table 14)
At the provincial level, equalization funds from DAU are the main source of district/city regional finance
The contribution of DAU to APBD during the period of 2004-2006 was always above 75%
Equalization funds contribute more than 86% of the total APBD revenue
In Kabupaten TTU and Belu, the contribution always exceeds 90% of total APBD revenue
In 2006, all local governments predict that the central government will raise the proportion of equalization funds, especially DAU
Therefore, the dependency of local governments, bothprovincial and district/city,  on the central government remains high
The contribution of PAD to APBD in the last three years in all district/city in West Timor are far below the provincial rate or less than 10%
In fact for Kabupaten TTU and Belu, PAD always contributes less than 5% of APBD
The PAD of Kabupaten Kupang and Kabupaten TTU between 2004 and 2005 decreased both in an absolute value and in percentage terms
In contrast, the other two districts (TTS and Belu) as well as Kota Kupang experienced an increase
In 2005, PAD Kabupaten TTS was higher than the other four districts
The types of revenue dominating the structure of PAD vary between the districts/city in the West Timor region
Kota Kupang is the center of the provincial administration and is also the capital of Kabupaten Kupang and Kota Kupang
Many kinds of business facilities and services, such as trading and shopping facilities, hotels and restaurants, as well as transportation, all subjected to local taxes and retribution
As a result, revenues from local taxes and retribution dominate Kota Kupang's sources of PAD, in fairly equal proportions
In 2004, revenue from local taxes and retribution for Kota Kupang contributed about 82% to PAD, but for 2005 it declined to around 71%
PAD for Kabupaten Kupang in the 2005 fiscal year fell 36.4% compared to fiscal year 2004
The largest decrease came from other PAD in the budget item, which includes SPK
SPK represents the largest source of PAD revenue, contributing more than 70%
The contributions of local taxes and retribution in the 2004 and 2005 PAD are less than 9% in each year; while for 2006, the contribution of both charges is predicted to increase by more than 13%
For the planned 2006 APBD, a decline in PAD revenues of up to 12% is expected
As is the case in Kabupaten Kupang, other PAD also dominates the PAD of Kabupaten TTS and TTU
In 2004 and 2005, in Kabupaten TTS other PAD contributed 66% and 71% respectively to PAD; but its contribution for 2006 is expected to fall to approximately 23%
The contribution of local retribution to PAD exceeds the local taxes in Kabupaten TTS
Revenues from local taxes and retribution, as well as from profits from local government enterprises in 2006 are expected to rise sharply in order to compensate for the decline in other PAD
In Kabupaten TTU, other PAD contributes about 70% of PAD, followed by revenue from local retribution contributing more than 17%
The value and percentage of SPK contributions to PAD have continued to rise, up from Rp466.5 million (5.2%) in 2004 to around Rp1.4 billion (10.2%)in 2006
The government of Kabupaten TTU has also budgeted for a sharp increase in retribution revenue
In Kabupaten Belu during the period 2004-2006, retribution was the largest source of PAD and contributed more than 40%, followed by other PAD, which contributed more than 30%
Kabupaten Belu targeted an increase in SPK revenue for 2006 of around Rp1.24 billion (10% of PAD) or an almost twofold increase from the preceding year
As mentioned in chapter III, the trade of some major commodities in the West Timor region is subject to local charges, some of which are packaged as, or have been changed into SPK or administration fees
SPK are recorded in the other PAD category
The contribution of SPK to the provincial and district/city PAD varies
At the provincial level, SPK contribute less than 1% of PAD
Similarly, the contribution of SPK in Kabupaten Kupang was only 0.7% in 2004-2005 and is targeted for an increase to around 1.1% in 2006
Meanwhile in Kabupaten TTU and Belu, the contribution of SPK to PAD has reached more than 5% and in 2006 is expected to be 10%
The contribution of levies or retribution collected by agencies in the agricultural sector (including food crops, plantation, forestry, fisheries and animal husbandry) to PAD is generally less than 5%
The exception is Kabupaten TTS which, in 2006, is targeting around 8% of PAD
Charges from the agricultural sector generally contribute less than 0.5% of APBD
The planned APBDs for fiscal year 2006 in all regions of West Timor indicate that local governments will impose new levies and increase tariffs for existing retribution in order to increase PAD
In contrast, local government's continuing efforts to increase PAD from the trade of agricultural products by imposing SPK or changing to administration fees, is compelling (as detailed in chapter III)
Nevertheless, the contribution of regional income to APBD from various charges on agricultural product trade is quite small, and all efforts to intensify it will not make any significant increase
B Impacts on the Business Climate
Regulations, both those that do and do not attract charges, have a direct and indirect impact on market structure and the prices received by farmers and producers, traders' profits, and the business climate in general
As outlined in Chapters III and IV, this study did not come across any regulations that directly created a monopoly or special preferences, or that were inclined to distort the market
However, indirectly, trade and transportation licenses and charges for several agricultural products affect the prices received by producers (farmers, fishermen, home industries)
Formal and informal charges paid in the trade of agricultural products vary between commodities and their origin and destination market
Parallel with the various regulations and charges detailed in Chapter III, the investigation into charges attracted by the trade of various agricultural commodities (Appendix 8) revealed that livestock (cattle), timber and non-timber forest products, and other commodities for inter-island trade are the products attracting high charges
Generally, the total cost of charges are relatively small, less than 10% of the final selling price to the consumer, or inter-island/large trader
Most of the charges range between 0-6%, consisting of formal charges (0-6%) and informal charges (0-1.4%)
Charges are one of the trading transaction costs components
Theoretically, rational traders will make an effort to maintain their profits, and compensate for additional transaction costs by raising their prices at the consumer level or lowering their buying prices
In the case of inter-island trade and export of agricultural products from West Timor, inter-island traders have a monopsony market structure and have the power to determine any profit level they wish
As inter-island traders generally do not have the power to determine the selling price of commodities in the national and international markets, they will strive to maintain their profits by burdening producers and farmers with additional charges, which reduces the prices received by the farmers
This graph provides evidence of this in the trade of cattle, tamarind, and candlenut in West Timor (Figure 5)
Although the analysis of trading charges from the interviews shows that the total amount of informal charges are relatively smaller than formal charges, the impact of informal charges are more problematic for business operators as the charges are unpredictable
Types of informal charges include
an extra amount of formal charge being paid because the amount of formal tariff is unknown or it is voluntarily paid; payment of formal charges that have been eliminated; and bribery intended to smooth the transportation of the goods
Bribes paid at roadside checkpoints account for the highest proportion of informal charges that traders object to
There are 20 checkpoints between Atapupu and Tenau and one more checkpoint from Kefamenanu to the port of Wini (Table 15)
The commodities facing excessive controls are timber, cattle, tamarind and candlenut
The trader pays an informal charge to each checkpoint as they pass it
They gets a stamp and signature on the letter permit
In normal situations the charge is relatively small, however if the controller (usually a policeman) finds a mistake or discrepancy in the papers accompanying the commodities, the charges can be can be very high
These excessive controls affect not only the cost of transportation but also the time needed to transport the goods
As seen in Table 15, Kabupaten Kupang has the highest number of checkpoints, which have created great uncertainty
The checkpoints act as a disincentive to farmers and small traders to transport their own commodities to Kupang
A trader of tamarind and candlenut in TTU, for example, sold his produce to Atambua even though he knew that the selling price in Kupang is higher
He did this because of the informal charges he would experience during the trip and the uncertainty involved in transporting goods to Kupang, which would eat into any price difference
The uncertainty caused by excessive checkpoints in Kupang also discourages farmers and village traders in TTS to sell their products directly to Kupang,
Instead they ask inter-island traders to purchase the commodities from the village at a lower price
They are afraid of unexpected charges they may encounter along the road
VI CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This study finds that farmers in West Timor generally have weak bargaining powers
Although there is no government regulation that restricts the entry of new traders
The small numbers of large inter-islands traders dominate price formations, while the relatively large numbers of intermediate traders have little influence over commodity prices
The recent increase in the number of traders and exporters coming to Kupang, however, has not fully benefited farmers
This is due to the limited accessible information on product locations, the poor condition of the roads infrastructure in each region, and an excessive number of inspection points that result in an increase of informal charges as well as uncertainty regarding fees and transportation times
The existing traditional markets do not support the marketing of agricultural commodities for inter-islands trade, which are the major source of farmers cash income
Most products sold at the weekly market in rural areas are imported from other regions
The district/city efforts to increase or maintain PAD have not changed from the pre-regional autonomy era
Most retribution that should have been eliminated have been renamed as SPK or administration fees, with no emphasis on service provision
The total cost of the charges is relatively small compared to the unit value of the commodities
However, there are indications that any increase in charges will cause a reduction in the price received by farmers
The licensing requirements and regulations have encouraged excessive inspections and the imposition of informal charges that distort the marketing of agricultural products, particularly exportable ones
Generally, the types of charges imposed by district/city governments on food crops and plantation products have decreased
But the charges on forestry products, cattle, and fisheries have not experienced much change
Farmers and traders are generally not aware of the decreases in the number of retribution and other charges, as this information has not been disseminated to the public
In addition, there is almost no publicly accessible information regarding licensing procedures and the actual cost of the charges
The study results also show that improvements in the regional business climate are closely connected to central government policies and regulations, as several local regulations follow the regulations issued by the central government
Thus, the central government still has an important role in the creation of a good business climate in the region
The contribution of SPK and other charges related to the agricultural sector to PAD is very small, and efforts to increase it have resulted in no significant additional contributions for the regional budget
However, such efforts have had a negative impact on trade in agricultural commodities and the prices received by the farmers and producers, who are predominantly poor
Local governments should carefully review their policies regarding the imposition of charges
As local budgets will continue to depend heavily on the balancing funds from the central government, local government should concentrate on developing the local economy, by creating more new jobs, and increasing people's income in general, rather than thinking only of ways to increase local revenue
In this context, several suggestions for efforts to be made by local governments follow
There is a need to review existing licensing requirements and regulations, to assess whether they really serve the intended objective
A reduction of informal charges should follow, and all charges should be linked to the provision of services
Although the total cost of formal charges only accounts for a small fraction of the product price, minimizing charges, licensing requirements, and regulations will reduce the opportunity for the excessive controls that induce the imposition of informal charges
The removal of licensing requirements, regulations and charges should be implemented and widely disseminated to all stakeholders and the public
Licensing procedures and all charges involved should be transparent, and information regarding the changes should be made publicly available, for example by placing posters in public areas, subdistrict and village offices, and via local radio and television announcements
Special effort should also be devoted to minimizing inspections and eliminating uncertainty due to informal charges
If inspections are considered necessary for security reasons, it will be better to minimize the number of checkpoints by placing integrated (multi-sector) checkpoints only in strategic locations
Particular officials should be clearly assigned to guard against the involvement of any other officials
The control procedures, the official in charge, and the penalties for violation of the regulations should also be disseminated to the public
There is a need to increase the knowledge of local governments and the regional legislature on the differences between retribution, administration fees, and third party contributions
There is also a need to improve documentation of regulations and make it easily accessible to the public
To maximize the benefits to farmers and producers, attempts should also be made to increase market competition by attracting more traders and businesspersons
This could be done by improving access to roads, increasing the role of markets in local products marketing by involving the local community and creating a commodity market (possibly seasonal), and publicizing local products to attract buyers from other regions and overseas

ABSTRACT
A Qualitative Study on the Impact of the 2010 PNPM-Rural in East Java, West Sumatra, and Southeast Sulawesi
This study aims to look at the impact of PNPM Rural especially on poverty reduction, community participation, and the accountability, transparency, and responsiveness of the government at the village level
In addition, this study also examines the impact of PNPMRural on the fulfillment of the poor's primary needs in rural areas as well as the extent to which empowerment has occurred
The study was carried out in 18 villages in three provinces, namely East Java, West Sumatra, and Southeast Sulawesi
Initially, this study was designed to divide the research areas into treatment and control areas
However, because in 2010, PNPMRural covered all districts, there was no longer any research area that could be fully regarded as control areas
In terms of methodology, this study uses a qualitative panel and compares the results of the 2010 PNPM Impact Study with the 2007 PNPM Baseline Study
In general, this study finds that PNPM-Rural has been implemented properly
For the open menu program, almost all the villages used it for infrastructure development
However, only a small part of the SPP-PNPM program was actually accessed by the poor
In relation to poverty, there has been a decrease to varying degrees in almost all the research areas
It is just that for the issues of participation, transparency, and accountability, there was a big difference between what happened inside and outside the program
Participation, transparency, and accountability worked very well in the implementation of PNPM-Rural
However, outside PNPM-Rural, namely in the village administration or in the implementation of programs other than PNPMRural, participation, transparency, and accountability remained low
Furthermore, community empowerment did not go well either
This can be seen from the fact that there was almost no PNPM project that corresponded to the primary needs of the poor

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Introduction
The National Program for Community Empowerment (PNPM) Mandiri is a poverty reduction program launched by the Government of Indonesia in 2007
The biggest component of the program is for the empowerment of the village community
Following the format of its predecessor, the Kecamatan (Subdistrict) Development Program (PPK), the PNPM Mandiri encourages community participation in every stage of the program
Based on what is agreed by the community, the village administration then submits development proposals to the kecamatan level
The program requires that the block grants be allocated for distribution at the kecamatan level; the villages must then compete to prove that they deserve the grant based on the principles of urgency and significance for the poor community
To evaluate the impact of the program, The SMERU Research Institute in cooperation with the World Bank conducted a qualitative evaluation study
In general, this study compared the sample villages' recent condition with their condition prior to the program implementation
the data of villages' recent condition had been collected through a baseline study in 2007
The data collection was done through focus group discussions (FGDs), in-depth interviews, and monitoring of the PNPM-Rural activities
The study was conducted in 18 villages in 9 kabupaten (districts) in 3 provinces, namely East Java, West Sumatra, and Southeast Sulawesi
Following the sampling method of the baseline study, the locations of the study were divided into three categories
(i) villages/nagari that had participated in PPK phase two (PPK-II) since 2002 and were recipients of the PNPM in 2007 (hereafter referred to as K1);
(ii) villages/nagari that had not participated in PPK-II but were recipients of the PNPM in 2007 (hereafter referred to as K2);
(iii) villages/nagari that had not participated in PPK-II nor the PNPM in 2007 but were recipients of the PNPM in 2009 (hereafter referred to as K3), when the government proved their commitment on the inclusion of every kecamatan in the program implementation
The whole study was conducted between March and October 2010
Characteristics of Study Areas All the sample villages are rural areas that mainly depend on farming
Some of the villages are located in coastal areas, but the majority of the villagers live from farming and keeping livestock
In addition to farming, the villagers work in small trading sector as kiosk owners and in service sector as ojek (motorcycle taxi) service providers, construction workers, or migrant workers
In the last two years, many villagers in Kabupaten Bombana and Kabupaten Konawe Selatan (Southeast Sulawesi) have worked at public gold mining sites both as miners and as providers of goods and services for the miners
The condition of roads in the sample villages relatively varies
In East Java Province and West Sumatra Province, most of the village and dusun roads are in good condition
In Southeast Sulawesi Province, many parts of the kabupaten or even provincial roads that pass the sample villages are in a very bad condition
During the past three years, most of the damaged roads have been repaired, partly funded by the PNPM
However, inadequate public transport facilities remain an unsolved problem and the villagers generally rely on ojek for transportation
In the sectors of basic education and health, most of the sample villages are already equipped with adequate facilities
However, primary schools are not available in some villages in Southeast Sulawesi, so the children have to attend schools at the not-so-near neighboring villages
Other education facilities such as preschools, junior high schools, and senior high schools are generally unavailable in villages other than the kecamatan capitals
Health facilities in the sample villages in Southeast Sulawesi are still lacking in numbers
In other sample villages, health facilities such as polindes (village maternity posts), pustu (secondary puskesmas), and posyandu (integrated health service posts) are available, but their conditions are in need of improvement
In terms of clean water supply, most of the sample villagers do not consider it as a major issue
However, some villagers from certain dusun or RT still find it difficult to access it
Economic facilities such as traditional markets are accessible for the sample villagers in general
Main Findings 1
Implementation of the PNPM-Rural Almost all sample villages chose infrastructure projects for the open menu program category
Only one village (in Dharmasraya) submitted a proposal of a non-infrastructure activity's training on developing home industries
The infrastructure that was constructed was roads, bridges, irrigation systems, waterways, school buildings, and posyandu
The villages chose infrastructure projects because (i) there was not adequate infrastructure at the study area; 
(ii) the PNPM was regarded as a program for the general public; 
(iii) they wanted to cushion the negative impact of targeted programs such as the Direct Cash Transfer (BLT), Rice for the Poor (Raskin), Family of Hope Program (PKH), and Health Insurance for the Poor (Jamkesmas); 
and (iv) the elite and nonpoor villagers had biased opinions during the decisionmaking process
The Women's Savings and Loan (SPP) program is considered greatly beneficial because it has (i) developed the recipients' businesses, (ii) improved households' financial capacity, and (iii) replaced loan sharks
The recipients used the program fund to develop their old business and to create new business
The program implementers required that recipients already have their own business
A small portion of the program fund was used for households' urgent needs
Especially in Ngawi, SPP has reduced the villagers' dependency on loan sharks since the program offered competitive interest rates and simple procedures for those who have already had their own business
The PNPM implementers limited the poor's access to the SPP program by imposing strict requirements for fear that the poor would not be able to repay the loan
There were also cases in which certain people cheated to get the fund, by falsely including the names of the poor on the list of people who submitted the program proposal
The fund would then be used by the cheating nonpoor for their own benefit
The SPP fund disbursement was then considered as a prerequisite to get the open menu program by most of the program implementers in the villages and the village officials
Therefore, many community members did whatever they could to get the fund, including by means of deception
For example, many business groups applying for the SPP loan were instantly established only to get the fund
In many areas, names of the poor were falsely included on the list of fund recipients; but when the money was disbursed, it was distributed among the nonpoor
However, conversely, in Desa Keramat (Kabupaten Gresik, East Java), the community leaders deliberately refused to get the SPP fund for fear that they would not be able to repay the loan, which means an automatic failure in getting the open menu program
Generally, the villagers' involvement in the decision-making for the open menu program and the SPP was merely instrumental, only to fulfill the program's formal requirement
The increasing number of villagers being present at the PNPM meetings did not fully alter the village elite's domination in the decision-making process
The villagers, particularly the poor, were still passive participants
The condition was due to some factors
(i) kinship, (ii) patronage system, (iii) the village elite's reluctance to live by the principles of democracy, and (iv) the elite's feeling of superiority over their fellow villagers
These factors caused inequality during the decision-making process
The increasing women's participation in the PNPM planning and implementation processes could not erase men's dominance
men's dominance was less noticeable in the special forum for women, a meeting held to generate women's ideas, which would propose one suggestion for the SPP and another for the open menu program
However, men's dominance was still apparent in the special meeting
in some sample villages, the final decisions for the suggestions from the special forum were made at the village level
The decision-makers at this level were the village elite, which is dominated by men
At some sample villages, the PNPM implementation could lead to and even has caused conflicts, such as conflicts of interests between jorong/dusun, conflicts between the village administrations and the program implementation team (TPK), between the TPK and the community, and between the locals and the nonlocals (those who migrated to the villages from other places), and conflicts regarding supplies of goods and services
In addition to lack of knowledge of the program and thus lack of program socialization, the cause of the conflicts was because there was not enough coordination with or involvement of relevant people in the program implementation
In West Sumatra, the area unit for the program implementation was jorong
Therefore, the nagari leaders felt that they were not involved, so no one could facilitate communication between jorong
Lack of coordination also created conflicts between the village administration and the TPK, while conflicts between the locals and the nonlocals were triggered by jealousy over economic gap, the villages where the nonlocals live are more developed than those where the locals live, just like what happened in Dharmasraya
With the PNPM requiring the community's self-help, the program funds were often granted to the nonlocals' villages
This is due to the fact that the roads there were wider and the villagers had more lands, so when requested, they were willing to give up their lands for the program
At the locals' villages, the roads were narrow and the villagers were not willing to give away their small lands, so they did not get the PNPM physical programs
The kecamatan facilitators considered that the workloads given to them were not evenly spread among the available resources
Some facilitators had working areas covering 10 villages, while some others had to facilitate more than 50 villages, just like what happened in one kecamatan (not a sample kecamatan) in Kabupaten Agam, West Sumatra
Moreover, the facilitators thought that the technical and administrative works, such as the monthly report writing, have taken most of their time, so they could not make the most of their job as facilitators
The kecamatan facilitators also believed that there should have been special facilitators who were assigned to empower the SPP recipients
It is because they already had heavy workload and not all facilitators at the kecamatan had the skills related to microcredit empowerment
There were microcredit facilitators at the kabupaten level, but they were actually more needed at the kecamatan level
Governance, Participation, and Representation in Decision-making In most of the sample villages, the decision-making process generally involved only the village elitesâ€”the village officials and community leaders
The village elite and most of the villagers believed the village elite already represented the whole community
Other members of the community were usually passive participants when they were present, only listening to and agreeing to what the elite decided
Some villagers, especially the poor, did not attend the meetings because they felt inferior
Other reasons for the villagers' absence in the meetings were apathy, unfavorable time of the meetings, and not getting any invitation
During the decision-making process at the village level, women were often represented by formal institutions regarded to speak for women, such as the Family Welfare Empowerment (PKK) or Bundo Kanduang in West Sumatra
Consequently, women were less represented than men
However, compared to the condition eight or three years ago, more women have attended the decision-making process at the village level although this did not really change the fact that men still dominated the process
In addition, most villagers still believe that men are the leaders, so they, instead of women, should make the decisions
The system of representation did not function properly, clearly seen from the absence of mechanisms at the RT/dusun level to get the villagers' aspirations or to disseminate results of the village meetings
No meeting was held to absorb the villagers' aspirations because the village elite claimed to have understood the villagers' problems more than the villagers themselves
The village elite also thought that not all the decisions made and information gathered from the village meetings should be disseminated to the community, especially if money was involved
The fact that the villagers very rarely asked their leaders about any information, decisions, and activities at the village level added to the problem
Information was usually given to the villagers during informal meetings such arisan and religious gatherings
The villagers were generally passive when it came to information on development, except for that on direct aid such as Raskin and BLT
At the village or dusun level, such information was usually given orally from the head of the village to the head of dusun/RW/RT and then from the head of dusun/RW/RT to the villagers
The information was generally on the program's activities and implementation
Information regarding activity funds or budget was seldom given to the public
Moreover, the village administration staff generally gave information which was instructive or mobilizing, such as the information on community work
When there were problems or unsatisfactory results, the villagers generally did not voice their complaints or dissatisfaction to the village administration
They only talked about the problems among themselves or with the community leaders
Only a few villagers were willing and had the courage to tell the village administration
This condition was due to some factors, such as the villagers' reluctance, fear to the village officials, and apathy (because of previous unattended complaints)
In general, the participation model set out by the PNPM did not have any significant impact on the government system (participation, transparency, and accountability) at the village level
This was apparent from the comparison of villages that had been beneficiaries of the PNPM since 2002, 2007, or 2009
Only one village claimed to feel the impact of the PNPM on activities other than PNPM
In other villages, participation and transparency applied during the PNPM implementation were regarded as the program's special features that did not have to be applied on other programs
The fact that PNPM did not have any significant impact on the government system in general was caused by some factors
(i) the elite's dominance and the villagers' lack of initiative, thus preserving the status quo; 
(ii) absence of guarantee (incentives) for the village officials and villagers that if they had applied the PNPM mechanisms on other programs, they would have been given something in return, such as a project; 
and (iii) the village officials' and villagers' tendency to live by the existing norms
If a program or an activity did not require participation, transparency, and accountability, they would not impose those requirements
3
Poverty and Its Dynamics There were less poor people in the majority of the sample villages compared to the previous eight or three years with varied declining rates among the villages
Factors that have brought about the decline were, among others, (i) new job opportunities or job opportunity expansion such as the gold mine exploitation in Kabupaten Bombana, Southeast Sulawesi; (ii) opportunities to be migrant workers; (iii) regional segregation, creating new economic centers; and (iv) new factories/plantations at the neighborhood
In addition, the poverty decline was also caused by the rising prices of plantation commodities in West Sumatra and sea commodities in Southeast Sulawesi
Other factors were the better rural roads, the increase of farming productivity, and government aids
PNPM indirectly contributed by facilitating the construction of public infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, and irrigation systems and farm roads for the farming sector
There were more poor people in two villages in East Java than before
The increase was due to the decrease in sea commodities productivity caused by environmental degradation (sea pollution by the industrial wastes) and the decline in labor participation caused by industrial mechanization
In both cases, the villagers did not make use of the PNPM as an instrument to solve the problems
Poverty characteristics were mainly connected by the villagers to the aspects of asset ownership, daily needs (including education and health) fulfillment, and types of occupation
For example, having minimum assets and no fulltime job was considered as the main reason for someone to be poor
This belief has not changed significantly in the last eight or three years
The determiners of poverty dynamics included factors of economy, social, public and government institution frameworks, government's support, and programs' targeting
Economic factors, such as the rise and fall of prices of farm/sea commodities and prices of daily needs, as well as government aids, played the biggest role in the cases of some poor households whose economic condition has fluctuated for the past eight years
The condition of the poor to remain poor was generally caused by the absence of skills and capital to improve their life
It was specifically because (i) there was a limited number of alternative job opportunities in addition to their main field work, which is in the farming sector; (ii) the poor were generally junior high school graduates and had only traditional skills (as farmers, fishers, or construction workers); (iii) they did not have enough capital, especially capital funds
Although there had been some aids offering capital funds, what they really needed was financial aid, like direct cash transfer, that they did not have to repay
Other significant factors, according to the villagers, were their mental attitude that they did not feel the passion to develop or that they felt satisfied easily, not being able to be productive due to old age, being economically dependent widows, and the increasing prices of daily needs
Poverty reduction programs, especially those with special targets, such as BLT, Raskin, and Jamkesmas, significantly contributed in helping the poor so that they would not get poorer
The BLT funds, the Jamkesmas cards, and the Raskin subsidized rice were considered to have helped the poor with their daily needs regarding emergency cash needs, health expenses, and food
The three programs have also been regarded as the top three of government programs which are the most beneficial for the poor
Unfortunately, the program targeting was in the hands of the village elites with no room for the poor to decide or for transparency
The PNPM was regarded as playing an insignificant role in reducing poverty
This was because the program implementers did not think that it was a poverty reduction program
They thought it was merely a village development program
Consequently, they did not put the poor as top priority
This was apparent from the facts that they made project plans without considering the benefits for the poor; that they did not specifically include the poor on the list of workforce for the PNPM construction projects; and that they did not exclude the poor when they required self-help
Dynamics of Access and Quality of Public Services In general, the sample villages already had public service facilities in the education, health, water supply, and economy (market) sectors
This has contributed to the increase of the villagers' access to public services during the past eight or three years
In this regard, PNPM was thought to have been quite beneficial since it helped to provide additional facilities or to improve the condition of the existing facilities, including the road repairs
Besides, the road infrastructure improvement facilitated by the program was also considered helpful in improving the villagers' economy
However, in some sample villages, for some community members, public facilities were still difficult to access
This was caused by, among others, (i) the limited number of facilities, (ii) the unavailability of public transport to reach the facilities, and (iii) the absence of quality services especially health services
Regarding the quality of public services, the villagers thought that it needs to be improved
In the health sector, for example, Jamkesmas card holders felt that they were not treated as well as other patients were
In some sample villages, civil administration services, especially the obtainment of ID card and family card, were considered to have become more complicated since the villagers had to go to the kabupaten
Dynamics of Needs and Their Fulfillment In almost all sample villages, the poor's main needs were job opportunities, capital loan, and skills upgrade
Then, they also needed scholarships, free health services, and infrastructure to support their main livelihood (such as an irrigation system and farm roads)
The government and some groups of villagers have made efforts to fulfill the needs, but to no real avail
It was because (i) the existing programs were not adequate to fulfill the villagers' needs; (ii) there were sociocultural conditions in the villages, such as social envy, the elites' or the poor's bias judgments, and (iii) there were deviations or there was ineffectiveness during the program implementation that lessened the impact on the villagers' needs fulfillment
The Rural PNPM was seldom aimed at fulfilling the villages' primary needs
The PNPM open menu program was often used to build general infrastructure that did not directly cater the poor's needs
The SPP could partly fulfill the needs for capital loans, but it was difficult for the poor to gain access to the program due to its strict condition that required a person to have a business before applying for a loan
The PNPM has not been successful in empowering the village community because of some factors
(i) the improper structure of power in the villages where the elites were dominant, marginalizing the poor; 
(ii) the mechanistic model of empowerment of the program
facilitators were only told to make sure that the program stages were properly conducted and not to open the villagers' eyes or to improve the villagers' capacity with regard to the program objectives, which are to encourage the creation of good governance (participation, transparency, and accountability) and improve the villagers' economic capacity based on self-help; 
(iii) the mismatch between the program's mechanism and the local cultural characteristics
PNPM encourages individual participation in the program's activities as well as in the village/nagari administration matters, while the local culture such as in West Sumatra urges stronger communal representation by restoring the nagari administration tradition; 
(iv) the ineffective work of the facilitators due to heavy loads of technical and administrative works;
and (v) the poor quality and experience of facilitators as well as the frequent area rotation for the facilitators and high turnover of facilitators
In August 2006, the government launched a poverty reduction umbrella program which is named National Program for Community Empowerment (PNPM) Mandiri
Under this umbrella program, there are numerous types of PNPM and the biggest one is PNPM-Rural (PNPMPerdesaan)
The design of PNPM-Rural is based on its predecessor, that is, the Kecamatan (Subdistrict) Development Program (PPK)
This program was already implemented in 2007 and currently (2010), its implementation has covered 4,805 kecamatan
In general, PNPM aims at reducing poverty, increasing cooperation between the community and regional government to improve the effectiveness of poverty reduction, increasing community's participation in the development process, improving the regional government' capability in providing public service, and improving the capacity of social institutions in the regions
After PNPM-Rural had been implemented for three years, The SMERU Reserach Institute in cooperation with the World Bank conducted a qualitative study to learn the latest condition as well as the changes that occurred in relation with the goals of PNPM in reducing poverty, increasing community's participation, and strengthening regional government institutions
To deeply explore the changes that took place, the results of this study will be compared with the results of the baseline study of PNPM-Rural which was already carried out in 2007
Therefore, it can be determined what the changes are, how far have the changes taken place, and what have caused those changes
1.2 Research Objectives 
This study attempts to collect data on the changes that have occurred from time to time and the impacts that were brought about by PNPM-Rural by comparing it with the results of the baseline study conducted in 2007
Therefore, this study will go to sample areas that are the same as the sample areas of the baseline study
The main objectives of the qualitative study of the evaluation of the impact of PNPM-Rural are 
a) to document the latest condition related to the principles and goals of PNPM-Rural after the program has been conducted for two years in the treatment (and control) areas; 
b) to document and analyze the changes that have occurred from time to time as well as to determine what has PNPM-Rural contributed to the changes; and 
c) to understand the main reasons and factors that have caused the changes from time to time and that have probably affected the implementation as well as the results of the program
Moreover, this study investigates issues related to poverty, poverty targeting, and access to markets and public facilities, regional government, and empowerment as shown in Table 1
1.3 Research Methodology 
This impact evaluation study is a qualitative study that attempts to compare the condition of the treatment areas with the condition of the control areas in three different periods of time, which are a year ago (2009), three years ago (2007), and eight years ago (2002)
The year 2009 was when all areas that became control areas during the baseline study had accepted the program (becoming treatment areas)
The year 2007 was when the baseline study was implemented and 2002 was when PPK, as the predecessor of PNPM-Rural, had started
The purpose of comparing the treatment areas with the former control areas in three periods of time is to investigate the characteristics of the changes that occurred in relation with the length of the implementation of the program
It is assumed that the longer the implementation of the program, the stronger the institution and the more likely it succeeds, and vice versa
Data collection was carried out with four methods
in-depth interviews, focus group discussions (FGD), observation on the process or results of PNPM activities, and relevant document collection
In-depth interviews based on interview guidelines were conducted with key informants and household informants
Key informants consist of government officers related to the implementation of PNPM in kecamatan and villages such as kecamatan heads or persons in charge of projects (PJOK), village heads, heads of village development affairs, or dusun heads; 
PNPM implementers such as kecamatan facilitators (FK) and project implementing units (UPK) at the kecamatan level, and project implementing teams (TPK) and Village Community Development Cadres (KPMD) at the village level; 
active community leaders in the village both male and female; and common people that consists of the poor and the middle/rich, male and female
In addition, FGDs were conducted five times in every village
All FGDs covered one FGD with the village community's representatives which included government officers and community leaders, two FGDs with the poor community in which male and female FGDs were conducted separately, and two FGDs with the middle/rich community where male and female FGDs were conducted separately
Besides the interviews and FGDs, there were also observations on the process (when it is available during the field visit) or the results of PNPM activities
Finally, various relevant documents were collected, both prior to and during the field visit
1.4 Study Areas 
The study areas for this qualitative study of PNPM impact evaluation is the same as those for the 2007 PNPM-Rural baseline study, which are located in three kabupaten in East Java, three kabupaten in West Sumatra, and three kabupaten in Southeast Sulawesi
The study areas in the three provinces are divided into three time categories, namely K1 for areas which have been receiving treatment since 2002, K2 for areas which have been receiving treatment since 2007, and K3 for areas which have been receiving treatment since 2009
Areas which were previously designated as control areas, namely those which had not received PPK 2 or PNPM 2007, since 2009 have started receiving the programs
Therefore, in this study, there are no longer any areas which may be categorized as control areas in the true sense
That is why the comparative analysis between treatment and control areas cannot be conducted accurately
In this condition, what can be done is the interperiodic analysis
By observing changes that happened to the areas which have been receiving treatment at different times, it is expected to be able to see the PNPM-Rural's contribution towards the changes
Furthermore, in each kecamatan, two villages were chosen for different welfare categories, a poor village and a middle/rich village
The detailed list of study areas can be seen in Table 4
From the description above, it is seen that there are three comparisons carried out simultaneously in this study
comparisons between the treatment and controls areas; interperiodic comparisons between K1, K2, and K3; and comparisons between poor and rich areas
These three-dimensional comparisons capture the complexity of the problems regarding implementation and effectiveness of PNPM-Rural
1.5 Characteristics of the Study Areas 
1.5.1 Topography and Demography 
The villages that are included in this study are the exact same villages that were enrolled in the 2007 baseline study
Therefore, the general information on the villages' characteristics now and back then in 2007 is almost identical, except if there have been any changes in the past three years
The topography has not undergone any significant change compared to three years earlier
Some of the study villages are remote villages; some hilly, while some others flat
A small number of villages are located in coastal areas; for example, Desa Kramat in Kabupaten Gresik and part of Desa Lalembo in Kabupaten Konawe Utara
The study villages are divided into developed and poor villages
The developed ones are usually located very near the city, or at least near the administrative center, so they have urban characteristics
These villages are Jorong Aro Kandikir, Nagari Gadut, Kabupaten Agam; Desa Sindang Kasih, Kabupaten Konawe Selatan; Nagari Talang, Kabupaten Solok; etc
The poor villages are usually situated rather far from the city or administrative center, except for Desa Sumbersari, Kabupaten Lumajang, which is situated quite near Kota Lumajang, and Desa Batu Palano, Kabupaten Agam, which is near Kota Bukittinggi, even though it is quite far from the kabupaten capital
Some villages are adjacent to a forest such as Desa Tempursari, Kabupaten Lumajang, and Desa Lampeantani, Kabupaten Bombana
Especially the people of Lampeantani complain about their village being flanked by a protected forest, thus decreasing the size of their arable land
Their opinion is that if part of the forest were allowed to be managed by the locals, it would help alleviate the burden of poverty they have to shoulder
In East Java, Desa Jambangan, Kabupaten Ngawi, has the largest area, 87.78 km2
But, it also has a large population of 7,723 people
The smallest sample area is Desa Gendol, Kabupaten Ngawi, which is only 21.64 km2 and has a relatively small population of 1,296 people
The most densely populated areas are Nagari Sialang Gaung, Kabupaten Dharmasraya (10,389 people/17.40 km2), Desa Tempursari, Kabupaten Lumajang (8,762 people), and Nagari Talang, Kabupaten Solok (8.017people/15.66 km2)
The least populated area is Desa Lalembo, Kabupaten Konawe Utara (369 people/20.00 km2)
The distance of the study villages from their respective kabupaten capital is quite far, on average, more than 20 km
Four villages that are quite close to their kabupaten capital are Nagari Talang, Kabupaten Solok (5 km), Desa Jambangan, Kabupaten Ngawi (9 km), Desa Sumbersari, Kabupaten Lumajang (approximately 8 km), and Desa Lampeantani, Kabupaten Bombana (17 km)
Three farthest villages are Nagari Gadut-Jorong Aro Kandikir (80 km) and Nagari Batu Palano (65.7 km), both located in Kabupaten Agam, although they are very close to Kota Bukittinggi; and Desa Labungga, Kabupaten Konawe Utara (75 km)
The rest of the villages lie around 20-45 km from their kabupaten capital through relatively difficult terrain due to the hills or damaged roads
Administratively, the villages/nagari are divided into several dukuh or jorong (for West Sumatra), namely around two to five dukuh or jorong
In East Java and Southeast Sulawesi, on average, the number of dusun/dukuh per village is around two to four
Desa Gendol, Kabupaten Ngawi, has only two dusun/dukuh, namely Dusun Klito and Dusun Gendol, whereas the nagari usually have around two to five jorong on average
1.5.2 The Socioeconomic Condition 
Most of the PNPM villages in Java, West Sumatra, and Southeast Sulawesi are of the agricultural village type, be it dominated by rice fields (irrigated or rain-fed), palawija (secondary) crops, vegetables, or plantations and forests
Only Desa Kramat, Kabupaten Gresik, is truly a coastal village
Other than that, part of Desa Labungga, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, is categorized as a coastal area
Nevertheless, only a small number of the people in this village work as fishers
Most of the villagers work as fish farmers
Generally, the people in the study areas are farmers, either farmland owners, tenant farmers, or farm hands
One case that is conspicuous is the description of Nagari Gadut-Jorong Aro Kandikir, Kabupaten Agam, which is economically also supported by the non-agricultural sector; more than 50 household heads work as civil servants
More than 50% of the land in the PNPM study villages is agricultural land
For example, 62% of the land in Desa Belahan Rejo is used for agricultural purposes and in Nagari Talang, the agricultural land reaches 80%
The land produces a variety of agricultural commodities
The villages in Java commonly produce rice, sugar cane, vegetables, and palawija crops
Besides producing rice, the villages in West Sumatra and Southeast Sulawesi produce plantation crops such as rubber, coffee, cashew, cocoa, palm oil, and candlenut, as well as various vegetables
However, as rice producing areas, the villages rely solely on the rain, and as a consequence, can only harvest rice once a year, followed by palawija crop planting
Only Desa Kramat, Kecamatan Bungah, Kabupaten Gresik, produces saltwater fish and farmed fish
The villages in Southeast Sulawesi are less developed in the agricultural sector compared to the villages in the two other provinces
This is because agriculture is relatively new to villages in Southeast Sulawesi
The villages in Konawe Selatan or Bombana had just been introduced to rice field agriculture in the late 1970s, when transmigration was at its peak
According to the locals, the transmigrants had taught them how to cultivate rice fields
The villages in Konawe Utara, besides relying on agriculture, also reap benefits from plantations
There are several large plantations that provide alternative jobs for the locals
The community of Kabupaten Bombana, and even Southeast Sulawesi communities in general, since the middle of 2007 until 2008, when the business was at its peak, had discovered and gotten the advantage of running gold mines
Some of the locals tried to supply the needs of the miners
Nevertheless, in 2009, the regional government had forbidden the people from operating illegal mines
The locals believed that there had been some kind of lobbying from the business people to the regional government to take over the mines; therefore, the government issued the law forbidding illegal mining
At the moment, only very few locals dare to mine without permits
From the market access point of view, there are no significant problems in almost all of the study areas
In almost all villages, there is a market, or at least a Sunday market that operates once a week for two to three hours in the morning
The village farthest from a market is Nagari Sitiung-Jorong Piruko, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, which is approximately 20 km away from the nearest market, due to the ineffectiveness of the local market and Village Unit Cooperative (KUD)
The farmers in this nagari usually sell their agricultural and plantation produce to the intermediary traders who then take the produce to the market
1.5.3 The Government 
In general, there are three kinds of institutions in the study villages, namely the village/nagari administration institutions, social-religious institutions, and organizations formed by assistance programs
Even though formally each of these villages has a Village Representative Council (BPD), this institution has yet to function optimally
The institutions that are more dominant are the village/nagari administration institutions and religious organizations
The villages in Java, particularly in East Java where this study was conducted, are the bases of the religious organization Nahdatul Ulama (NU)
Because of that, organizations affiliated to NU such as Muslimat and Fadayat are very actively involved in social activities in these villages
Besides that, informal organizations and groups such as farmers' groups, arisan groups, and tahlilan groups are also active and thriving
On the other hand, the social organizations that are thriving in villages in Southeast Sulawesi are the ones affiliated to village officials such as the Village Family Welfare Movement (PKK), Karang Taruna (a village youths' organization), posyandu (integrated health service post), farmers' groups, etc
The social organizations active in West Sumatra are mostly extensions of the adat (customary)/nagari organizations
In the political field, in the past few years, the villages in East Java, Southeast Sulawesi, and West Sumatra have shown different conditions
The study villages in East Java have shown that transition in power happens festively
On the other hand, in Southeast Sulawesi, the election of village heads is not that lively
The tendency is that not many people are interested in running for the election
This is partly because most of the people come from one large family and have tight familial relationships
In such an atmosphere, a campaign vying for power is considered unethical
In addition, the dull election race is also caused by the lack of incentives for the village head
A village head in Konawe Selatan said that his economic condition has become stagnant ever since he became the village head
A completely different condition is found in villages in Java, where the incentives received by village heads are quite significant
In Desa Tempursari, Kabupaten Lumajang, for example, a village head could receive up to 5 million rupiah from his paycheck and tanah bengkok (village-owned land that is bequeathed to the ruling village head)
In West Sumatra, adat organizations are so strong and influential that in the nagari where the study was conducted, there was no bustle of a wali nagari (village head) election
The nagari administration in West Sumatra is evidently a communitarian governing model with a representation of kaum (familial groups from various generations of the same clan) which is strongly accounted
A village in Kabupaten Agam has designed a representation model in the village administration with a â€œone kaum one chair system in decision-making within the nagari
Each and every decision made can only be legitimate if it has been approved by the kaum representatives (usually represented by the mamak, or head, of each kaum) which can be numerous
Other than that, the boundaries of a nagari are not determined based upon normal territorial administration, but by adat laws
1.6 Research Team and Schedule
This study was conducted by The SMERU Research Institute researchers headed by Muhammad Syukri, assisted by five other core researchers, namely Sulton Mawardi, Akhmadi, Sirojuddin Arif, Kartawijaya, and Asep Kurniawan
In each study province, the SMERU researchers were assisted by twelve regional researchers
A small team of one core researcher from SMERU and two regional researchers was responsible for carrying out a study in each village
As a whole, this study took six months, from March to September 2010
The preparation was done from March to the middle of April 2010 which was continued by field visits from April 18th to June 10th 2010
From the middle of June to July, the finalization of field notes and village reports was carried out
Then, at the end of July, the results of the study were analyzed
Finally, the report was written until the end of August
1.7 Report Structure
This report consists of seven main chapters, plus an executive summary and various relevant appendices
Chapter I is the introduction that gives descriptions of the study, research methodology, and the characteristics of the study areas
Chapter II describes the implementation of PNPM-Rural in the study areas
This part is the gateway for explanations about the successes or failures of the program
Chapter III discusses the various aspects relevant to the government, participation, and accountability
This chapter reinforces the explanations about the implementation and impact of PNPM-Rural on the strengthening of regional government institutions
In Chapter IV, the dynamics of poverty are discussed
This part shows the most recent poverty conditions and the contribution of PNPM towards the reduction of poverty in the regions
Next, Chapter V explains the availability and accessibility of public facilities
Chapter VI describes the needs of the rural community and how they are fulfilled
In these two last chapters, the main problems of the rural community are evident and it is shown how the community utilizes PNPM to solve these problems
Furthermore, in these two parts, it can be seen whether or not there has been empowerment
The final chapter, Chapter VII, describes the conclusions and recommendations
II
IMPLEMENTATION OF PNPM-RURAL IN STUDY AREAS 
2.1 General Description of the Program and Its Implementation 
PNPM-Rural is one of the programs under the umbrella of PNPM-Mandiri
This program is directed towards the development of rural areas by granting an amount of funds through the kecamatan which will be managed by the rural communities themselves based on the mechanism that has been set
In this program, the kecamatan are given a block grant the amount of which is dependent on the population and poverty level of each kecamatan
To get the block grant, every village has to compete by submitting a proposal for a project to be implemented
For that, the village people have to choose a village facilitator who is going to assist with the socialization and planning processes
These people then hold meetings to discuss the needs and development priorities of their village
PNPM-Rural has two kinds of activities, open menu and Women's Savings and Loan (SPP) programs
While SPP program is mandatory for every village, in the open menu program, the community has to choose a development project that they need in a village consultative meeting (musdes) that must be attended by every element of the village
After all proposals are collected, there is an intervillage consultative meeting (MAD) that is attended by village representatives who will then discuss to make the final decision on which project is to be funded
After the block grant is allocated, social and technical consultants will help with the socialization, planning, and implementation
The village meeting has to choose some people that will become a part of the implementation team who will execute the project
Technical facilitators will help the implementation team to arrange the infrastructure plan, project budget, quality verification, and supervision
A more detailed description about the flow of PNPM process can be seen in Figure 1
In the study areas, in general, the stages as seen in Figure 1 were applied by all villages
However, there was a village in Kabupaten Agam (not a sample village) that received a sanction because it failed to hold the musdes for Socializing the Result of the MAD on Proposal Determination
According to a kecamatan official, it was because the village's program proposal failed to compete in the kecamatan MAD, so the representative did not feel the need to inform their loss to the village people
In areas that follow all the program stages, it was found that there were differences in the implementation quality from one village to another
The differences were mostly due to the high rate or low rate as well as the quality of the community's participation in various program activities
Besides implementation quality, in the study areas, there were also other cases found such as
a) delays in the completion of activities such as the case occurring in a village in Kabupaten Agam; 
b) delays in funds disbursements such as the cases occurring in Kabupaten Ngawi, Bombana, Konawe Utara, and Agam; 
c) SPP funds embezzlement by the group chairman such as the case occurring in Kabupaten Gresik; 
d) SPP arrears such as the case occurring in Kabupaten Konawe Selatan; 
e) hires of third party to do infrastructure work which was supposed to be undertaken by the community itself such as the cases occurring in Kabupaten Agam, Konawe Utara, Bombana, and Dharmasraya; 
and f) lack of matching funds from the regional budget (APBD); thus, no funds were granted by the central government such as the case occurring in di Kabupaten Konawe Utara
In addition, there were indications that the MAD on Proposal Determination process was conducted just as a formality, when in fact the decisions had previously been taken among the village heads
Several modus operandi discovered were by
a) adjusting the project budget with the number of activities that would be decided in the MAD so that every village could get a share; 
b) putting forward projects with a small budget as a priority so that more projects could be funded; 
and c) agreeing on a decision to not prioritize any village that had been granted a project in the following year
These indications were caused by the program's mechanism and procedures which are considered by the community as complicated and time consuming
A member of KPMD in East Java said, we keep having a meeting and discussing with no results
It was just wasting people's time (interview, male, 32, Kabupaten Ngawi, 23 April 2010)
2.2 Implemented Activities
In general, PNPM activities which were conducted in the study areas were related to infrastructure development
Basically, PNPM-Rural has two major programs, which are SPP and open menu programs
SPP program is a mandatory program that should appear in every village proposal, even though there are many villages that cannot meet its various requirements
In the open menu program, people can choose numerous activities in the list of activities that cover physical activities, empowerment, capacity building, etc
However, in the study areas, except in one village, all open menu programs proposed by the community were related to infrastructure, such as road hardening or asphalting; 
or the repair or building of a bridge, water channel, irrigation system, school building (kindergarten (TK))/early childhood education (PAUD), integrated health service post (posyandu), and so on
A jorong in Kabupaten Dharmasraya that chose a noninfrastructure program proposed and received training for homemakers on baking
The great aspirations of the village community towards the infrastructure programs are, among others, because 
(i) there is a lack of main infrastructure in the village, 
(ii) there is an understanding that PNPM is a program for all and, thus, has to be allocated on something that can benefit all people, 
(iii) PNPM is created as a minimiser of social envy caused by other programs that only benefit certain groups, 
and (iv) there is an indication of elite dominance in the village decision-making
These will be elaborated further in Chapter VI
2.3 Women's Savings and Loan (SPP) 
SPP program has been running well and is considered effective by the people
Only two villages were found not embracing SPP because there was yet any business group in both villages that met the criteria of SPP-PNPM and there was one village that refused SPP because the people were afraid that if there were SPP arrears, they would be denied the open menu program
The people thought that SPP is effective in taking over the role of bank titil (daily bank/loan shark) which has a quite strong influence in several villages, especially in East Java and Southeast Sulawesi
A female community leader in Kabupaten Ngawi said that in her village, there used to be many bank titil
But now, the number has decreased because she has worked hard to encourage people to borrow money from SPP-PNPM instead
An informant said, Many people used to borrow money from bank titil
This worsens one's economic condition
That's why I suggest people to borrow money here [SPP-PNPM] (interview, female, 47, Kabupaten Ngawi, 22 April 2010)
Moreover, SPP is also considered to give contribution to developing people's existing business and, in some cases, it can stimulate the community to create new businesses
An informant said, Like me now, with the capital I got from PNPM
I build a business and it's developing (Middle-class Women's FGD, 26, Kabupaten Bombana, 6 June 2010)
while another informant said, Road building helps because it can smooth out the traffic and SPP made women feel like a king (Middle-class Men's FGD, 40, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, 14 May 2010)
Finally, SPP can also improve household financial capacity
Even though, according to the understanding of SPP recipients, the funds are supposedly used to open a new business or strengthen their existing one, there is also some part of the funds that is used to pay for household needs
PNPM also provides social funds that can be used for important needs, such as, if there is a family member who gets sick, then SPP money is used
(Interview, male, 46, Kabupaten Ngawi, 21 April 2010) 
The problem is that the people who received [SPP] use the money for education, to pay for [children's] school tuition, because it was urgent
So, it's not used for business
(Interview, female, 42, Kabupaten Konawe Selatan, 7 June 2010)
Nevertheless, some problems related to the implementation of SPP appeared
Firstly, the poor had difficulty in accessing SPP because in the study areas, PNPM implementers in the kecamatan and villages required that every resident who wanted to apply for credit had a business of their own
This was to make sure that they were able to return the money as scheduled
Therefore, most of the recipients were from a more prosperous group
A facilitator in Southeast Sulawesi firmly said that SPP was not meant for the poor, but for those who already had a better economic condition (interview, male, 35, Kabupaten Konawe Selatan, 10 June 2010)
The following informants stated similar things
The loan is supposedly for the poor, but if you are really poor, you will not be lent
The poor who have not yet had a business are also forbidden to borrow money because they are considered unable to repay
(Poor Men's FGD, 50, Kabupaten Ngawi, 24 April 2010) Whereas for SPP, it seems that no women from poor families were eager to apply for the loans
This is because the first thing that the program implementer said was not how to manage the loans well, but instead they are threatened in case they are not able to return the money
So, the poor women do not dare to borrow money because they have no collaterals
(Interview, male, 60, Kabupaten Konawe Selatan, 3 June 2010)
In that matter, I do find many women are actively involved in some groups
But, I don't want it because I feel burdened if I have to be in the group which receive the loans and return them with high interests
(Interview, female, 54, Kabupaten Konawe Selatan, 5 June 2010) With such burdensome requirements, poor households fear applying for loans
In addition to their misunderstanding of the program, this fear is also caused by the program implementer who frightens the poor people so that they do not apply for the loans and encourage them to transfer the loans under their name to those who own a business
This is done by the program implementer at the village level under the understanding that SPP channeling is a part of the requirements to get the grant for the open menu program
If the village does not take SPP, it will not get the open menu program
A program implementer in Kabupaten Ngawi said that open menu programs which were frequently realized in the form of infrastructure development projects were really needed by the local people, so they tried hard to actuate SPP loans, including by outsmarting the implementation
Here, SPP payment is running smoothly due to the sanction implication
If there is often a delayed payment, the physical funds will be put off
So, the TPK is also involved in reminding the people to pay their loan instalments
(Interview, male, 56, Kabupaten Ngawi, 22 April 2010) That [SPP] also becomes one of the requirements to get the physical [program]
If SPP payments are late, the people will not get the physical funds
That's why, the head of the village also interferes
If one person's credit payment is in arrears, the village won't get the physical program
(Interview, male, 35, Kabupaten Konawe Selatan, 10 June 2010) 
However, in one village in Kabupaten Gresik, East Java, the concern that the failure of the SPP program to run smoothly would have an impact on the inability of accessing the open menu program encouraged the community leaders to refuse the SPP program
Whether or not the success of SPP program would have an impact on the open menu program is not explained convincingly by program implementers in the field
Some of them assume that SPP has an impact on the open menu program because of the requirement stating that SPP proposal is an automatic proposal of the three proposals which are put forward in the MAD
In addition, there were many attempts to bend the regulation of the program so that the village people can get the benefits easily
One of the indications found was the establishment of instant business groups to fulfill the requirement of applying for SPP
Actually, based on SPP regulation, the business groups should have existed and been actively operating for at least one year
This condition appears in nearly all villages as explained by a community leader in Kabupaten Konawe Selatan
So far, the business groups are usually established in order to get the loans
So, the benefit is getting a share of the funds (interview, male, 60, 3 June 2010)
There were also cases where the names of the poor were being used by those having better economic condition so that they can become SPP recipients
However, this misuse of names is considered legal; on the one hand, it is a way out to the problem of SPP funds channeling if it is conducted based upon the regulation of the program
But, on the other hand, there is a demand that SPP funds are channeled to the fullest
A KPMD in Kabupaten Konawe Selatan explained as follows
SPP [recipients] can become either a direct or indirect beneficiary
An indirect beneficiary means, for example, using my name, but the money is used by others, and that is allowed [according to PNPM]
This is called indirect benefit
It means a person borrows [SPP] and another person manages it
This is because PNPM prioritizes RTM [poor households], but because they cannot return the money, so non-RTM make use of it
(Interview, female, 42, Kabupaten Konawe Selatan, 7 June 2010) 2.4 Institutions in the Kecamatan and Village Viewed from the organizational structure, the institutions implementing PNPM are in accordance with the stipulations of the program, both at the kecamatan and village levels
What is felt to be not proportionate is the number of personnel, especially the kecamatan facilitators (FK)
In a certain kecamatan, an FK could have such a light burden because he/she only handles a small number of villages, whereas in another kecamatan, the FK could have an immense workload due to the large number of villages under his/her jurisdiction
In the study areas, most of the kecamatan have more than ten villages
Having a large number of villages/jorong to supervise, it is assured that an FK cannot carry out many of the empowerment duties such as villagers' group development, the strengthening of SPP recipients' businesses, etc
An FK who supervises 21 villages in Kabupaten Konawe Selatan stated that the administrative work, which has something to do with putting together monthly reports for the 15 project recipient villages, alone has expended all his time, leaving no spare time for the empowerment activities
Besides the disproportion of personnel to the workload, several FK also complain about the lack of microcredit facilitators
The need for micro credit facilitators has apparently become pronounced more because the FK have no time to supervise SPP recipients' groups that can total up to hundreds in just a single kecamatan
Admittedly, there are now some microcredit facilitators at the kabupaten level, but according to a facilitator in West Sumatra, these facilitators are needed more at the kecamatan level to implement empowerment activities associated to SPP
The facilitator thinks that because the SPP program is very important and widespread, it is perfectly natural to have a professional facilitator especially to ensure the smooth running of the program
At the village level, the PNPM institutions are marked by the local elite's dominance of key positions
In almost all of the study villages, the PNPM implementers, namely the TPK, KPMD, TP (monitoring team), etc., are part of the elite circle due to power or familial relationships
Basically, the election mechanism orchestrated by PNPM makes it possible for everybody to elect and be elected
But, because of the dominance of the village elite in various decision-makings, the existing mechanism is rendered void
The dominance of the village elite in the PNPM institutions is, among others, caused by the lack of alternative human resources besides the village elite and the disinclination of the commoners to be involved in activities that are considered to be part of the elite's turf
This belief that project administration in general, including PNPM, is the village elite's 'turf' is the result of the commoners' having rarely been involved in the management of government programs or aids
Regarding the function of SPP recipients' groups, there has been no further development aside from the fact they are only used as a means of obtaining loans
In terms of time and welfare categories, there is no difference between regions regarding the groups' function
The SPP recipients' groups' lack of development is because the group members and program implementers see the groups merely as a prerequisite to receive an SPP loan
There has not been any concrete effort made by either the PNPM implementers (in this case, the FK) or the community to improve the institutional capacity of the SPP recipients' groups so that they can function more than just a borrowers' group
2.5 Community Participation 
The community's participation at each stage of the PNPM-Rural is quite active
FGDs from various study areas show that the number of community members attending PNPM meetings is larger than any other meeting that has been held in the villages
For example, an informant in one of the villages in Lumajang said that the participation rate was approximately 70% of the adults in village
In a village in Kabupaten Konawe Selatan, Southeast Sulawesi, the meetings were only attended by 30 to 60 people out of a population of 900
This number was considered high because there had never been a meeting that attracted as many people before
The high attendance rate of the PNPM activities is because
a) PNPM is considered as a cash program, that is, a program that does not merely dole out promises, but shows instant realizations
This can be seen from a respondent's comment, PPK, because everybody here can directly reap the benefits
Such as the benefits of having easy access to clean water, the people here don't have to walk far to get water anymore
Water comes to our houses (interview, male, 42, 5 June 2010)
b) The people feel sceptical towards development planning through the development planning consultative meeting (musrenbang) because after years of planning, nothing has been realized
A village head in Kabupaten Bombana said, â€œI have been the village head for eight years now, but many of the plans are not realized because of the pending
The pending happened because of lack of lobbying (interview, male, 42, 4 June 2010)
c) In some areas, the competitiveness is very evident where the dusun members flock to the village hall to vote for their dusun's development proposals
Some members come because of their own awareness to win the competition, but some others come because of the dusun officials' prodding
Even though the people's participation rate in PNPM is quite high, many indications show that their participation is merely instrumental, only to fulfill the program requirements
A program implementer in one of the jorong in Kabupaten Agam said that he had to come to the village people's houses and persuade them to come to the musala (small prayer room) to participate in the jorong concultative meeting (musjor)
Still concerning this matter, a village head in East Java said, The system [to involve large numbers of community members] was not yet practiced in 2002 because this system was developed to fulfill the PNPM's requirements and in 2002 PNPM had not come to Desa Belahan Rejo yet (interview, male, 40, Kabupaten Gresik, 22 April 2010)
In the majority of villages, few community members participate actively
Only a small percentage of them dare to speak up, give suggestions, or object when they disagree on a suggestion
An informant's statement describes this condition
In such a meeting, the women are also invited
But, the same as with the men, they play no part at all
They [the women] are passive listeners
Oftentimes, after the meetings, they speak their minds, but only to other women or to other participants, not to the village head 
(interview, male, 53, community figure, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, 16 June 2010)
The people's fear to express their opinions and objections, on the one hand, is because they are unaccustomed to speaking in a formal forum such as a meeting
An informant from Dharmasraya said that the first time she had ever set foot in the wali nagari's office was the day she was invited as an FGD participant by the SMERU researchers
And then, if you are poor, you will never be invited, Sir
This is the first time in my whole life to be invited to this office, Sir (Poor Women's FGD, 32, 13 May 2010)
Besides that, some other informants voiced out their aspirations as follows
In addition, the passiveness also happens because of the dominance of the village elite
The poor and the commoners, especially the women, do not dare voice their requests or objections because they think that the only ones who are in the position to speak are the intelligent village elites as described above
The village elite's dominant position in the various studied areas is caused by, among others, the familial system or relationship, or patronal relationship
The patronal system is evident in villages in Java, where the economic structure creates patron-client relationships between employers and employees or between landlords and farm hands
In villages in West Sumatra, familial relationship which is translated into the communitarian governing system, namely the nagari, has a very large role in handing over the power to the nagari elite
Lastly, in the villages in Southeast Sulawesi, the familial relationship, even though not transformed into a formal system like that in West Sumatra, gives an undeniable power to the village elite
In such cases, it is impossible for the commoners and the poor to deny the wills of the village elite because between them and the elite are many layers of relationships
It has been known that in rural communities, the poor do not only have a formal administrative relationship with the village elite, but also have economic relationships (employer and employee), sociocultural relationships (between the head of a kaum and the kaum members/between mamak and nephews/nieces in West Sumatra) and familial relationships
Each layer of relationship has its consequences which are not to be viewed lightly if someone does something to jeopardize the relationship
losing a job, banned from the kaum, disowned by the family, etc
These statements describe this condition
Those involved in decision-making are the RT, RW, village administration and its officials, village institutions and community representatives from all areas, and community figures
In this place, Sir, abot sawangane, which means respect for the elders, is strictly held, the elders are asked for their opinions first
(Interview, male, 39, RT head, Kabupaten Gresik, 23 April 2010) As good community members who understand their rights and duties, it is probably very important for the village people to be directly involved in decision-making
But, if all community members are simultaneously involved in the decision-making, it would be taxing on the available resources, either in the sense of location or time
So, the method and system to be employed in Desa A [the name of the village is obscured] are through cooperation of the Bamus (Consultation Council) with the representatives of 58 kaum
As an example, to construct a perna [nagari regulation], the Bamus will make a [regulation] draft that is then given to the 58 representatives of the kaum
The representatives will discuss the draft with all of their kaum members
All suggestions are compiled to be re-discussed with the Bamus and wali nagari and combined with all other kaum's' compilations before they are made into a regulation
(Interview, male, 60, wali nagari, Kabupaten Agam, 10 May 2010) The rich have been employing the poor as farm hands
Without the jobs provided by the rich, the poor would become even more impoverished
(Interview, male, 53, village head, Kabupaten Gresik , 21 April 2010) 
Pertaining to the women's participation, all informants confirm that there has been a significant rise
Within PNPM, there are forums that are specifically formed for women
In these meetings, women actively voice their opinions
According to an informant, in some villages, such as those in West Sumatra, women can be more active than men
Women are clearly more active now
We are also invited whenever there are meetings to make decisions because we have new groups formed by PNPM
So, if there are any decisions to be made connected to the program, then we can voice our opinions
(Interview, female, 45, RTM, Kabupaten Ngawi, 25 April 2010) Ever since PNPM was launched, women's participation has raisen exponentially; sometimes, they are even more active than the men
(Interview, male, 40, TPK member, Kabupaten Agam, 16 April 2010) In the past, maybe because of the system in Minang or because of the terrain here, the women's participation rate in the jorong consultative meetings was quite low
But, since PNPM requires women to be represented, the women started to become more involved in decision-makings
(Interview, male, 33, jorong head, Kabupaten Agam, 16 May 2010) About the women, I hear that it's getting better because women are now always present in meetings, either group meetings or not
(Interview, female, 54, RTM, Kabupaten Konawe Selatan, 6 June 2010) Nevertheless, women's activeness does not always work in the decision-making process
The men still hold more power in deciding
The only decision-making medium that is relatively sterile from men's influence is the women's consultative forum which produces one SPP suggestion and one open menu suggestion
The minimum domination of men in this forum is because this forum is attended by women only
But, it does not mean that this forum is completely devoid of men's domination
In some places, such as a village in Kabupaten Gresik, women's suggestions, especially about SPP, are re-negotiated at the village level
Based upon the decision of the village elite, which is dominated by men, they concluded that they would not propose for the SPP
Their consideration was that they were afraid if their citizens would not dutifully pay back the credit
According to them, if SPP repayment is in arrears, their village will not get any open menu program
Therefore, rather than jeopardizing the open menu program, they would rather not propose for the SPP
Nevertheless, in PNPM forums, both the ones for women only and the mixed ones, not all the village women are involved
It is likely that only the women from the more prosperous families participate in the meetings
Some female informants from the less prosperous families said that they were never invited, let alone participated in the meetings in the village hall
The women rarely attend meetings; only the men do
I get information about the meetings from my husband
He talks about the meetings after he gets home
(Poor Women's FGD, 38, Kabupaten Lumajang , 24 April 2010) Women's participation now compared to that in 2002 has not shown any improvement
If it is said to improve, it's minimal
Women's representatives are often invited to meetings, but they are unenthusiastic about them and rarely come
(Interview, male, 40, Kabupaten Gresik, 22 April 2010) But, all this time, Sir, when women are invited to meetings, they only come for the sake of attending them
They rarely speak or give suggestions
(Interview, female, 42, Kabupaten Konawe Selatan, 7 June 2010) The lack of improvement of the poor women's participation is, among others, caused by many internal and external factors
The internal factors include their being occupied with their own job and life, feeling out of place or unimportant to attend the meeting, being old or ill, or being a widow
The external factors include not being invited, living far from the meeting venue, etc
But from all of the reasons given by the informants, it seems that the most dominant ones are the internal factors
This can be seen from the statements mentioned above and also in the Participation section in the following chapter
The poor, especially the poor women, feel that it is inappropriate for them to attend meetings at the village hall because they are not â€œimportant people or â€œintellectuals
III GOVERNMENT, PARTICIPATION, AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE VILLAGE 
In some sample villages, especially in Southeast Sulawesi, and some villages in West Sumatra, the village administration's institutions have not been well functioning yet
Oftentimes, those institutions only have names, but do not have any activities
The village administration only acts passively waiting for instructions from the higher-level governments and has no initiatives to encourage its people to develop the villages based upon its own capacity
In some other villages, particularly in East Java, the village administration tends to be more dynamic, open, and participative
The accountability of the village elite is also high
Institutionally, except for West Sumatra villages, all villages actually have the same organizational elements
And the same thing is the government mechanism because all villages are under the same regulations and law
In West Sumatra, the government at the village level is characterized by a local nomenclature, that is, the use of the term nagari with its elements for the lowest government unit
Although using a local nomenclature, basically those functions existing in the village administration also exist in a nagari administration
The different performances among the village/nagari governments generally lie in the human resources, both the officials in the village administration and the community
In addition, not less important in influencing the performance of the village administration is the ability of their budget to move the wheel of the administration, not only the budget from the village/nagari itself, but also that sourced from external funds or the higher-level governments
3.1 Information Flow and Transparency in the Village
Generally, the village elite, particularly the village/nagari head, controls and becomes the source of any information related to the life in the village
There are no mechanisms, forums, or media which formally necessitate and ensure that the information reaches the community
In this context, whether or not information reaches the community is not determined by the system but based on the kind-heartedness of the village elites
So, it is not based on the obligation as the village administration
Some information is passed on to the community by the village head or wali nagari through the head of dusun/jorong or RT head
The RT head is then asked to pass on the information to the community by using the regular local means and routine religious meetings in the village
For certain cases, the information is sometimes passed on formally through meetings in the village hall
But, this only occurs occasionally
The information that is generally passed on by the village official is information on programs from higher-level governments and also on voluntary community work activities (kerja bakti)
But, information on programs is not always conveyed openly, meaning only to the target recipients
There is a tendency that the village administration passes on more information concerning the obligations of the village community, while on the aspects that are related to the rights of the village community, generally the village administration has not been transparent
A village head in East Java explained
Not all information should be passed on to the community, especially that concerning the budget
As far as the budget is concerned, it cannot be exposed openly (interview, male, 45, Kabupaten Lumajang, 22 April 2010)
Besides, the information passed on to the community is normally partial
Any information which is more detailed or related to a project's finance or budget, for example, is not conveyed
None of the commoner informants can tell and know how much assistance money has been received by their village and how has the village administration spent it
One informant said, I even have no idea what ADD [Village Funds Allocation] program is, let alone anything about budgeting (Middle-class Men's FGD, 41, Kabupaten Lumajang, 25 April 2010)
In the matter of transparency, there is a different perception between the village officials and elite, and the community in general
The village officials and elite assume that the village administration has already been transparent when it comes to development programs as well as other governmental aspects
On the contrary, some community members assume that the village administration is not transparent because they are not willing to explain the various existing programs clearly
The following quotations describe the information flow and transparency in the sample villages
The information which is usually not spread in the community is the information about assistance for the poor
Sometimes, we know about it only after there are people who get the assistance
(Interview, male, 72, Kabupaten Solok, 1 May 2010) Sometimes, the information does not reach the community because it stops at the RT level
Information from the village officials never reaches the community because the RT heads never convey the results of meetings between them and the village officials
This information is usually obtained from a chat with people from a different RT
There has never been any transparency about the results of meetings in the village hall
(Interview, male, 46, Kabupaten Gresik, 23 April 2010) If there is a meeting in the nagari, the people who participate are normally the community figures
The poor are never invited
So far, the jorong and nagari parties, if they hold a meeting, they never inform the results of the meeting
I just know the information from my neighbors
(Poor Men's FGD, 31, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, 13 May 2010) For the past three years, PNPM has been the only one that distributes the information well, while for other public services, the way of information distribution has been same
(Interview, male, 38, Kabupaten Bombana, 6 June2010) The fact that the information is not distributed maximally and transparently is due to the obstacles in the social structure and the institutional infrastructure of the village community, especially those concerning with the wide relationship gap between the village elite and the community
In all sample villages, the village elite still consciously pose themselves as being more superior, knowledgeable, and responsible than the common people
On the other hand, the community in general acts passively, and even tends to be ignorant, towards any information concerning many village life aspects
They usually just wait for the information to be conveyed by the officials
Rarely does the community proactively ask for information to the village officials
The following quotations reflect this reality
If it is let known by the wali jorong [jorong head], then I will know the information
If it is not, I will not get the information
(Interview, male, 72, RTM, Kabupaten Solok, 13 May 2010) Here, the people are not active enough to seek information
Only when there is an invitation or they are visited by the village officials will they get the information
(Interview, male, 31, middle-class villager, Kabupaten Bombana, 8 June 2010) No need to ask questions to the jorong
For us, working at the rice field is more important
(Interview, male, 49, middle-class villager, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, 26 April 2010) The apathetic attitude of the community towards the information concerning the village administration is probably because the community has no concern for the information
For most village people, what is important is that the work they do daily can run well
This kind of community attitude can possibly lead to the absence of urgency in the village officials to run the government transparently
In this context, both the community and the village officials do not seem to consider transparency in the government as a crucial topic to discuss, let alone realize
The information flow as explained above has not changed in the last eight or three years, except for the information flow in PNPM which is more well structured through group meetings, posters, and attachments of financial accountability reports during project implementation
However, the model of information flow from PNPM does not give many impacts towards other program models or other village policies
Out of the village samples, only one village was found to have citizens who demanded that other programs imitate the transparency model applied by PNPM
3.2 Participation and Representation in Policy-Making 
In most study areas, decision-making at the village level is usually carried out in meetings attended by the village elite (the village officials, BPD, LPM (Community Empowerment Institution), PKK, RW/RT, and community figures)
They are considered to have already represented the community
It is not necessary to invite all village people because their opinions are already represented
If the community figures are already invited, the people are already represented (interview, male, 38, village official, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, 6 June 2010)
In some other sample villages, some village people are involved in village meetings
But, at most, they only listen or verify decisions that have already been made by the village head or the village administration
At least, there are three reasons why the village people, especially the poor, are not directly involved in decision-making processes
Firstly, just like at other government levels, the community has already been represented by various institutions formed to represent the community
Secondly, technically, it does not seem to be possible to involve the people directly in decision-making processes because of, among others, the limitation of the meeting room capacity and the accommodation cost
Thirdly, a meeting that involves a large number of people is inefficient as explained in the following statement
All villagers do not need to be made present in the meetings because they can make the meeting chaotic and it becomes difficult to reach an agreement
It is enough with the representatives only (interview, male, 40, village official, Kabupaten Gresik, 22 April 2010)
Direct community involvement can only occur at the dusun/RT level
Unfortunately, very few villages hold meetings both at the dusun and RT levels
Meetings frequently held at the dusun/RT level are only the informal ones, such as pengajian (Quran recitation), yasinan (Quran recitation to pray for the dead), or arisan, which are not meant to discuss village problems
Informants or community members in the sample villages have different comments on the decision-making process like the one explained above
First of all, there is a community group that considers that their participation has been represented by the village elite and the community figures attending the decision-making process
This group of people believes that whatever is decided by the village administration must be the best decision
I just believe in them because they have the capacity
Like wali jorong, he is chosen and trusted by the community, in accordance with the saying, didahulukan salangkah, ditinggikan sarantiang [a leader who is close to his/her people]
It is enough because if all people are present in a higher forum, imagine how crowded the meeting will be
The total population in Nagari A [the name of the nagari is obscured] is around 2,500 people
If half of the population is adults, it means 1,200 people will attend the meeting
(Interview, male, 36, middle-class citizen, Kabupaten Agam, 15 May 2010) All of us really trust the RT [head] and kasun [dusun head]
They will prioritize and care about the community's interest
So, we put our faith in the hands of the RT head and kasun
(Interview, female, 45, RTSM, Kabupaten Ngawi, 24 April 2010) It is good if kadus [dusun head] represents his/her people [in the meeting] because kadus also knows what his/her people need
The RT here does not function; kadus functions more
(Interview, female, 48, RTSM, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, 9 June 2010) Secondly, there is a community group that is critical and considers that the decision-making process does not completely reflect people's aspirations
In other words, some decisions accommodate the interests of the village elite more than the interests of the community
To prevent bias decisions in favor of the village elite, they want the decision-making process to directly involve the community
Some informants said, Well, sometimes it is adequate, but sometimes it is not
It's adequate if it can represent the people's aspirations
It's not adequate if they put forward their personal interests or if it is just for the sake of agreeing on any decision
It seems like that
(Interview, male, 49, RTSM, Kabupaten Gresik, 26 April 2010)
I don't think we are [adequately represented] because poor people like me have more needs than other people do
(Interview, female, 54, RTSM, Kabupaten Konawe Selatan, 8 June 2010) It is not enough if only the jorong [head] represents the people because wali jorong doesn't really know the people's conditions
Wali jorong doesn't exactly know what the people need
And what is worse is that now many people in the community of Jorong A [the name of the jorong is obscured] do not like the present wali jorong
Many people want the present wali jorong to step down, but he doesn't want to because he expects that when Jorong Aro Kandikir becomes a part of Kota Bukittinggi, he will be made a civil servant
(Interview, female, 29, middle-class citizen, Kabupaten Agam, 17 May 2010)
In the implementation of PNPM, the participation and representation of the community can be classified as high
All informants admitted it
But, the good level of participation and representation in PNPM has in fact little influence on other policy processes and programs
Participation in the policy-making and programs in the village have generally experienced no changes
Participation and representation are still seen as normative and formal
As a result, there is no fixed pattern to further absorb aspirations regarding the needs and interests of the village people in general
And there are no patterns which make it possible for the active involvement of the people in formulating needs as well as in decision-making
This condition is also supported by the local culture and, thus, it becomes a tool of legitimation for the village elite as well
For example, the term abot sawangane (Javanese) which in the local culture means to give priority to the leaders and elders is often used as an excuse to break the deadlock over participation and representation of the community
The following quotations describe community's opinions on their representation and participation in the decision-making process at the village level
Although the community figures invited to the meetings are quite many, there are infrequent debates in this kind of meeting
In the meetings, the one who talks a lot is the village head and the other village officials, while the other participants of the meetings just concur
(Interview, male, 38, village official, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, 6 June 2010) No need to invite all people because there are representatives
(Interview, male, 48, village official, Kabupaten Gresik, 26 April 2010) The important thing is that we can be aware of the issues discussed and actually, every community member [should be invited], but we are sometimes not invited
There are those who are invited, but they are too lazy and bored if they have to attend meetings all the time
(Interview, female, 40, Kabupaten Bombana, 4 June 2010) We concur to whatever is decided by the village officials, especially on the things that are related to the village development
I never get involved in any decision-making
I just follow the decision and it's all up to the village officials
(Interview, male, 60, RTM, Kabupaten Gresik, 28 April 2010) The problem is that those who attend the meetings are only the community figures, Sir
(Poor Group's FGD, male, 45, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, 13 May 2010) 
The people are perhaps going to be interested to come to the meeting if the meeting is related to an assistance that is going to be distributed
There are many meetings that are not related to assistance distribution
(Interview, female, 44, RTM, Kabupaten Agam, 15 May 2010) 
Especially for women's participation and representation, most of the informants in all sample villages exclaimed that since the implementation of PNPM, formally the participation of women in the decision-making process has experienced an increase
In this matter, women's participation is generally still instrumental because it is more out of the necessity to meet the formal requirement of the program
Besides, the increase of the participation generally occurs in the middle to upper class community
For the poor community's group, women's participation tends to stay the same, or in certain villages, it is even decreasing
The poor women's position is still marginal
This fact is reflected in the following statements
We have to admit that it still has little influence
Because the way other activities are done is still unlike PNPM
Only the community figures and the village officials are often involved
The women being involved are only the community figures
If it is PNPM, all people are involved and know the development of the program
(Interview, male, 40, KPMD member, Kabupaten Gresik, 25 April 2010) The representatives of PKK are invited, where the members of PKK come from the middleclass group
Women from the poor community are never invited
When it was still a village administration, women from the poor community were represented in meetings by women as well, but since it was changed into a nagari government, there has been no women's representation from the poor community anymore
Rarely do they get invited
(Poor Men's FGD, 31, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, 13 May 2010) I am invited when there is only an election, Sir
I am never invited, Sir
Only now am I invited to the wali nagari office (to become an FGD participant of this study), Sir
(Poor Women's FGD, 33, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, 3 May 2010) Women might be invited to meetings discussing women's matters
(Interview, male, laki-laki, village official, Kabupaten Ngawi, 21 April 2010) In a meeting like that, women are also invited
But, just like their male counterparts, there are no roles to play
They [the women] come only as listeners
Oftentimes, after the meeting is finished, then they speak out their ideas
But, they only talk about it with other women or other participants of the meeting, not to the village head
(Interview, male, 38, village official, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, 6 June 2010) Women's involvement in decision-making is minimal
They stay silent most of the time and are less superior compared to the men
Their involvement has improved [though] compared to the time before PNPM
(Interview, male, 51, Kabupaten Gresik, 23 April 2010) In nagari meetings, there are no women invited
If it is a Bundo Kanduang meeting, they are invited, but the participants are selected
(Poor Women's FGD, 66, Kabupaten Solok, 12 May 2010) What's the use of attending the meetings
There are already those who are responsible for each field
In nagari meetings, there are the nagari officials
If it is a Bundo Kanduang meeting, there are members that attend
If we come, those people are given meal boxes
We just watch while they eat
(Poor Women's FGD, 40, Kabupaten Solok, 12 May 2010) 3.3 Representation System The representation system in the village is formally regulated by the law through the village's duty to form a BPD
BPD is expected to be able to perform as a legislative body at the village level that ideally receive and channel community aspirations
In villages of K1, K2, and K3 categories, it turns out that BPD and other representation systems have not functioned optimally
The community regards the institution or person that is supposed to be representing the community's interests in the formulation of community's needs, programs' decisions, and policies tend, until present time, to become a legitimation tool of the village administration
This is indicated by the absence of special meetings at the community level (RT/RW/dusun/jorong) to absorb community's aspirations as well as to inform how far have the aspirations been realized
According to respondents, eventhough the village administration system recognizes dusun- and RT-level governants, there are no planned activities in the dusun and RT except for giving information to the people as ordered by the village head
At the dusun or RT level, there are no routine meetings held to discuss problems occurring at the RT or hamlet level
However, in the context of representation system, some people consider that the system is already good because it represents the community's aspirations in general, while some others are unsatisfied because they do not think it is transparent
If explored further, community members who consider that the representation system has already fulfilled their aspirations do not base their consideration on the reality whether or not the system has run well
This kind of attitude is dominantly caused by the social relations that place leaders' domination as something absolute
These are reflected by the following statements
I don't think we need to [take part in making decisions]
We have people representing us already
That should be enough
We all have faith in the RT and dusun heads
They surely prioritize and care about the community's interests
So, we give full authority to the RT and dusun heads
We never [complain]
And whatever the decision is, I accept it
If there are dissatisfied people, it is never more than people whispering to one another, but they do not do anything
(Interview, female, 45, RTM, Kabupaten Ngawi, 24 April 2010) Well, it's already enough if we have wali jorong to represent us because he knows the people's condition better and he has been given the authority to represent the people
(Interview, female, 32, RTM, Kabupaten Solok, 15 May 2010) Rarely do people ask about the decisions from meetings attended by community figures because they have complete faith that they will be represented by the community figures
(Interview, male, 40, RTM, Kabupaten Lumajang, 24 April 2010) If it's about complaints on the village decision, it has never happened before
The community usually accepts the decisions that have been decided because they believe in their representatives in the village institution
(Interview, male, 49, dusun head, Kabupaten Ngawi, 27 April 2010) On the contrary, those who are disappointed with the representation system practices that have been applied all this time have the following arguments
Well, sometimes it is adequate, but sometimes it is not
It's adequate if it can represent the people's aspirations
It's not adequate if they put forward their personal interests or if it is just for the sake of agreeing on any decision
It seems like that
(Interview, male, 49, RTSM, Kabupaten Gresik, 26 April 2010)
It is not enough if the community is only represented, but they have to know the conclusion from the meeting
(Interview, male, 38, middle-class citizen, Kabupaten Bombana, 8 June 2010) The decision all depends on what the wali nagari, jorong head, and other nagari officials want
(Interview, male, 36, middle-class citizen, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, 16 May 2010) The village administration makes policy through a meeting held with concerned village officials without the village community being present
The people should be involved if there is a meeting at the village hall
But here, we are never invited
So, if something happens, we just tell one another
(Interview, male, 46, middle-class citizen, Kabupaten Gresik, 23 April 2010) 
3.4 Complaints, Conflicts, and the Solution Mechanism 
In the sample villages, it can be said that there has never been any serious conflict related to the implementation of the program
The conflicts that occur have never been so massive that they create social tensions or horizontal mass conflicts between community groups
At the village level, this is probably the reason why there has never been any conflict or complaint resolution mechanism to handle conflicts and complaints caused by any program or policy at the village level
When conflicts or complaints happen, the solution is handled sporadically and it is usually the village head who acts as the main actor in solving the problem
These conflicts can generally be solved through explanations and consultations involving community figures
During PNPM implementation, conflicts have ever occurred in several sample areas such as in Nagari Batu Palano and Nagari Sariak (Kabupaten Agam), and Desa Jagir (Kabupaten Ngawi) (the last two nagari/village are not sample villages)
For Nagari Sariak, the case was around the suspicion of the locals concerning the decrease in the water debit because of the PNPM clean water project in Nagari Batagak that took the water from the water source in Nagari Sariak
In Nagari Batu Palano, the case involved Jorong Aceh Baru, Padang Tarok, and Simpang Tigo regarding the use of PNPM roads in Jorong Aceh Baru and Padang Tarok to carry materials for the PNPM road building project in Jorong Simpang Tigo
According to Batu Palano's Wali Nagari, this conflict would not have happened if the nagari administration had been involved in the program implementation, especially in the coordination between jorong, because the jorong administration has no authority whatsoever, except for the extension of wali nagari's authority
Therefore, resolving a problem in and between jorong is more effective if it involves the nagari administration
In Desa Jagir, the case was caused by a disagreement among some of the villagers regarding the talud (breakwater) building proposal that later became the village proposal
Some citizens who disagreed regarded those who formulated the proposal as incompetent (it was likely that the proposal formulation was not transparent)
The first case could be solved well by involving the kecamatan head and the Public Works (PU) Office of Kabupaten Agam
For the second case, the problem could be solved at the nagari level
For the case in Desa Jagir, it is still in the process of finding the solution by kecamatan facilitator
Outside the three conflicts, other PNPM implementation conflicts occur within the village scope such as conflicts between the village administration and TPK, conflicts between TPK/community and certain interest groups, and also conflicts related to the procurement of goods and services
However, these conflicts did not trigger any social tension and the problems could be solved internally at the village level
Pertaining to the complaints of the community towards the performance of the village administration and/or a program implementation, most of the respondents stated that the village community generally says nothing
They tend to keep the matter to themselves or talk about it with their fellow citizens
This condition is, among others, due to the feeling of reluctance and fear towards the officials, as well as the loss of hope because the complaints they conveyed have never been responded to positively
This phenomenon is recorded in the following quotations
Never conveyed any complaints to the jorong or dusun head
I'm afraid that I would be ridiculed or that I would be a gossip target in the community
Rather than being gossiped by others, [it is better] not to convey any complaints
(Interview, male, 51, RTM, Kabupaten Agam, 13 May 2010) I never conveyed it [complaint] to the village administration
The complaint only becomes the talk at the community level
(Interview, male, 38, middle-class citizen, Kabupaten Bombana, 8 June 2010) If there is a dissatisfaction/complaint, people tend to feel shy or reluctant to convey the problem and usually just gossip with one another
(Interview, female, 60, middle-class citizen, Kabupaten Lumajang, 25 April 2010) I usually only tell my friends
If I don't get Raskin, I don't dare to tell the jorong head
And I couldn't stand keeping it to myself either
So, I share the problem with my friends and laugh while talking about it, Sir
(Poor Men's FGD, 44, Kabupaten Solok, 16 May 2010) Even if there are people who are dissatisfied, they just tittle-tattle over the problem, but they don't do anything
(Interview, female, 45, RTM, Kabupaten Ngawi, 24 April 2010) Even if we complain, it will be useless
No one will pay attention because the ones who protest are considered as common people
(Interview, female, 46, middle-class citizen, Kabupaten Lumajang, 26 April 2010) 
3.5 Accountability and Responsiveness of the Village Administration 
In general, in all the sample villages, a systematic mechanism for village administration's accountability and responsiveness is not available
The village administration's accountability still depends a lot on the leadership of the village head, not yet on the institutional system
Made worse by the condition in which the community members who generally still put themselves in the inferior position in the leader-people relation, the village head becomes a dominant figure
The village administration is then identical to the village head
Based on this, the community has different assessments over the accountability of the administration
For a village/nagari that has a capable and responsive village head/wali nagari, the local community generally regards the village government as having a high accountability
On the contrary, for a village/nagari that is lead by a village head/wali nagari whose leadership does not really meet the bar, the community in general assesses their village administration to have a low accountability
This phenomenon appears, among others, because in the village administration practices, the village head never gives the accountability reports regarding the work performance of the village administration openly to the village community
Even if there is an accountability report, it is only submitted to the BPD at the most
In one of the sample villages in Southeast Sulawesi, a BPD member even stated that the BPD had never received any report regarding the income and expenditure of the village administration, including ADD/RAPBDes (Village Budget Plan) funds, from the village head
Not all information has to be reported to the people, especially that involving budgeting
Budgeting issues should not be widely open
(Interview, male, 45, Kabupaten Lumajang, 22 April 2010) Nyo ganjia mah buk, kok ado pitihnyo warga dak tau doh, pi kok nan kabagotong royong capek warga tau mah [This is different, Ma'am
If it concerns money, the people know nothing and don't need to know, but if it's about gotong royong [voluntary mutual cooperation in the neighborhood] the people are informed quickly]
(Interview, female, 54, Kabupaten Solok, 13 May 2010) 
For ADD, the supervision is unlike the usual [strict]
The inspectorate is the one that develops and also controls
So, that is that
But, PNPM is supervised and followed regularly, while the volume has been predetermined
But, if it's another project, such as ADD, there is no supervision, just a program alone, the report, well, you can make it the way you want
You plan it by yourself and implement it by yourself
Yeah, that's our regional head
(Interview, male, 45, Gapoktan head, Kabupaten Konawe Selatan, 9 June 2010) There are ADD financial problems managed by the village, such as unclear budgeting for posyandu; supplement foods for children five and under are also unclear
For Dusun A [the name of the dusun is obscured] citizens, in the end, PKK and activities for children five and under use the pengajian funds
There is a jimpitan rice assistance program
If we want to protest, it's useless
They won't listen to our protest because they think of us as common people
The village head's wife ran for legislative member last year [2009] and lost, and she seemed to have fallen into a lot of debts, so the ADD operational funds as well as the Raskin funds were used first for her businesses
She rented the tanah bengkok [meant for village officials] to other parties when it was still idle
When it was finally going to be used and it was claimed by the respective officials, the lessee forced the village head/his wife to pay back and they even brought police and soldiers along
Being used to dealing with soldiers and police, to them, protests submitted by village people are not worth their attention
(Interview, female, 46, middle-class citizen, Kabupaten Lumajang, 26 April 2010) Aside from the village head's leadership, the community's assessment over the accountability of the village administration is also influenced by political aspirations
The supporters of village head candidates who lost in the election generally tend to give an unsatisfactory assessment towards the elected village head
A village head in di Kabupaten Gresik, for example, stated, We've done our best but they [the supporters of the village head candidate who lost the election] still think that what we've done are all mistaken, let alone if we make real mistakes (interview, male, 40, 22 April 2010)
Community assessment on the village administration's accountability also depends on whether their interest is accommodated or not, without considering other factors
For BLT, for example, the poor people who do not receive BLT will instantly accuse that the village administration is not accountable, shows favoritism, etc.
While in fact, the authority to decide BLT recipients is not in the hands of the village administration
The following quotations give a description on respondents' perception towards the accountability and responsiveness of the village administrations in the sample areas
Most of the village people are already quite happy with the existing services
(Interview, male, 40, RTM, Kabupaten Lumajang, 24 April 2010) The administration has not yet been able to be fully responsible for its community
(Poor Men's FGD, 37, Kabupaten Gresik, 23 April 2010) Once I suggested to the village head to plea to PDAM to install PDAM water pipes up to RT 8
The village head said, God willing, I will propose to it. But, until now, there has been no news from the village head regarding the development of his proposal
(Interview, male, 40, RTM, Kabupaten Ngawi, 25 April 2010) 
3.6 Impact of PNPM on Good Governance in the Village
As seen above, PNPM management model which puts forward participation, transparency, and accountability has not had an impact on the management of the village administration, both on the bureaucracy management and the management of programs received by the village
Based on information from and observation in the villages, it seems that this is caused by the following factors
First, as described in Chapter II, the strong domination of the village elite and the lack of iniative from the community have contributed to the status quo to continuously be well established
Community members are usually afraid or reluctant to suggest changes to the existing mechanisms that are related to participation and, even more, transparency and accountability
Demanding better transparency and accountability means challenging the ruling village elite
After a while, this condition creates indifference among the community members
Second, there is no guarantee for the community that if they duplicate the mechanism applied by PNPM in programs and activities in the village, they can earn something (project)
Participative planning in PNPM will certainly end with a project, while planning involving as much community participation as possible through the musrenbangdes, for example, may not necessarily give birth to a project
This condition is worsened by the fact experienced by those who take part, especially, in the musrenbangdes, that from year to year, their proposals have never been realized
Besides, in certain cases such as the cases in several villages in Southeast Sulawesi, after the proposal that had been designed participatively was realized, in fact those who got to reap the benefits were only certain people from the village elite
On the other hand, for the village elite, such mechanism as the PNPM will obviously be a disadvantage for them, in the sense that their domination will be removed along with the removal of various privileges that they enjoy
Third, there is an indication that the community and village officials lean towards a normative attitude
If a program or certain activity does not require participation, transparency, and accountability, they will not demand it either
Such normative logic is apparently becoming stronger because there is no critical awareness as well as sufficient understanding among community members about what ideal governance is
IV THE DYNAMICS OF POVERTY IN THE STUDY AREAS 
4.1 Poverty and Its Dynamics 
The concept of poverty has evolved from merely someone's inability to fulfill his/her basic needs to the concept that poverty is a complex condition involving social and moral dimensions
As the dynamics of social, economic, political, and cultural lives evolve, the concept of poverty also turns multidimensional
Poverty involves the dimensions of health, nutrition, education, vulnerability, powerlessness, inequality, social exclusion, and voicelessness
In general, it can be said that the problem of poverty is related to political and social ideas that reflect the community's expectations and aspirations
Poverty is a condition where a certain life standard considered decent by the society is not fulfilled
Respondents in the study areas, including those who are poor, generally still perceive poverty in its most basic form, namely someone's inability to fulfill his/her basic needs
This phenomenon probably indicates that the poverty occurring in the sample areas is absolute in nature
The explanations that follow depict the aspects related to the level and condition of the local poverty
4.1.1 Poverty Indicators 
In all sample villages, the poverty has similar indicators/characteristics
Both the FGD and the in-depth interview results reveal that the dominant poverty characteristics are centered upon the aspects of asset ownership, daily needs fulfillment, and types of livelihoods
In the asset ownership aspect, the poor are usually characterized by 
(i) bad/uninhabitable housing conditions; 
(ii) lack of sanitation facilities/MCK (bathrooms, laundries, and latrines), or having them but in an unhealthy condition; 
(iii) lack of assets or valuable furniture/home electronics; 
and (iv) lack of capital goods such as rice fields, plantations, fish farms, or fishing boats
The following quotations illustrate the characteristics of poverty in the asset ownership aspect
In general, the poor live in bad houses
(Village Representatives' FGD, 45, Kabupaten Gresik, 23 April 2010) Tak andik [poor], bamboo houses, woven bamboo walls, dirt floors, clay tile roofs, lamps with electricity from the neighbor's house, small houses
(Village Representatives' FGD, 41, Kabupaten Lumajang, 22 April 2010) The poor families' houses have palm leaf roofs
The ventilation is not adequate
(Village Representatives' FGD, 45, Kabupaten Konawe Selatan, 13 May 2010) They don't have adequate household furniture
(Interview, male, 56, community figure, Kabupaten Lumajang, 23 April 2010) Not having MCK
You've got to run to the stream
(Poor Women's FGD, 45, Kabupaten Bombana, 4 June 2010) A communal MCK, on the river or ponds
(Poor Women's FGD, 28, Kabupaten Solok, 11 May 2010) Lack of arable land
(Poor Women's FGD, 51, Kabupaten Solok, 12 May 2010)
For the bansaik [poor], some have land and some don't
Even if they do, it's very limited
(Poor Women's FGD, 64, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, 12 May 2010) Fishers are poor
The ones who are wealthy are usually boat owners
(Poor Women's FGD, 50, Kabupaten Gresik, 22 April 2010) Ingin bakabun tanah ndak ado, wak tiok pagi lah poi ka ladang urang [I want to farm, but I don't have any land
Every morning, I go to work on someone else's land
(Poor Women's FGD, 37, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, 13 May 2010) Not all respondents agree that the condition of one's house is an important indicator of poverty
Their opinion is based upon the fact that there are some community members who have nice and inhabitable houses, but lack any productive assets or regular incomes, and thus still experience difficulties in fulfilling their basic daily needs
Therefore, the household is categorized as poor
The nice houses are usually built by their relatives or children
In the aspect of daily needs fulfillment, the indicator of poverty is generally associated with difficulties in fulfilling food, clothing, health, and educational needs
The following statements describe the lives of the poor in the sample areas
Enough to buy food for the day, while for the next days, we'll cross that bridge as we come to it
(Poor Women's FGD, 38, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, 4 June 2010) We go to the traditional healer first
If we don't get better, then we go to the puskesmas [community health center]
(Village Representatives' FGD, 43, Kabupaten Agam, 11 May 2010) Well, because of our extreme poverty, we are mostly elementary school dropouts
So, we are unable to find any other job [besides being farm hands]
(Village Representatives' FGD, 40, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, 4 June 2010) [They] can't afford the doctor
(Interview, female, 21, community figure, Kabupaten Gresik, 23 April 2010) Tak andik ..
difficult to get healthcare
Some go to traditional healers; some go to drugstores [to buy over-the-counter medicine such as Bodrex and Mixagrip]
Tak andik ..
Many don't go to school ..
Some go to pesantren [Islamic boarding school] ..
Most are only elementary school graduates
(Village Representatives' FGD, 38, Kabupaten Lumajang, 24 April 2010) Parents educate their children up to junior high school only
(Village Representatives' FGD, 41, Kabupaten Lumajang, 24 April 2010) In the types of livelihoods aspect, the sample communities characterize the poor as a group of people who do not have regular jobs and/or have low-paying jobs such as farm hands, rubber tappers, construction workers, and sand miners
Even though we already do odd jobs
You can say that we do any kind of menial labor
(Interview, male, 49, poor citizen, Kabupaten Gresik, 22 April 2010) The poor and very poor, they receive wages from the wealthy
(Village Representatives' FGD, 53, Kabupaten Solok, 11 Mei 2010) They work as daily laborers
(Middle-class Women's FGD, 45, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, 14 May 2010) They work as tenant farmers ..
In other words, they have nothing
(Interview, male, 31, village official, Kabupaten Gresik, 24 April 2010) Work as rice scavengers from the discarded rice stalks
They don't have any land
They work as farm hands in other people's rice fields
(Interview, male, 47, village official, Kabupaten Solok, 13 May 2010) It's hard [for them] to find a living
They usually search for vegetables in the forest to sell
They don't have regular jobs
(Interview, female, 28, middle-class citizen, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, 5 June 2010) Besides the indicators mentioned above, some respondents in the sample villages also included other poverty indicators
In Desa Belahan Rejo, Gresik, for example, they characterized the poor as a group of people who are self-conscious and do not socialize much with the general population
It is as if the poor â€œisolate themselves so that the village authorities have difficulties in involving them in community activities
But this self-isolation is perhaps a reflection of their pragmatic mindset
The poor usually spend all their time trying to fulfill their basic needs, as described by the statement, â€œThere has been a posyandu for a long time
It is about 300 m from my house
I know that it is scheduled once a month on Mondays, but I never bring my children to the posyandu
I have no time
All my time is spent in the plantation cutting rubber (interview, female, 38, poor citizen, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, 12 May 2010)
To a certain extent, the self-isolation is also perhaps a reflection of their perplexity and even loss of hope as a result of the difficulties they face in their lives, as seen in this following statement
The poor are narrow-minded and are always bewildered because they seem to be hitting brick walls
Aku iki kerjo opo, usaha opo ...
Kok kabeh ora iso [What job should I do
What business can I do
Why can't I do anything?] (interview, male, 63, poor citizen, Kabupaten Lumajang, 27 April 2010)
Sociologically, there may be many factors that can explain the poor's self-consciousness
But it is perhaps simply associated with their relative position in the society
In a community where the proportion of the poor is small, making them the minority, the inclination to self-consciousness increases
In Desa Belahan Rejo where the proportion of the poor is only around 15%, the sentiments of belonging to the failure group are stronger
On the other hand, in Desa Lampeantani, Bombana, where the poor amount to 68% of the population, the poor have no self-consciousness or difficulties in socializing with other members of the community
This is proven by the following statement, There is no significant difference and there is no problem in the social relationships
[It is the poor] who in fact can finish the job whenever they [the wealthy] throw parties
The wealthy just sit around and wait for their coffees to come
Hahaha (Village Representatives' FGD, 44, Kabupaten Bombana, 4 June 2010)
Another indicator that characterizes the poor is that the poor are usually made up of people who are no longer productive due to old age and/or widows, as depicted by the following statement
They are mostly elderly widows or elderly people who can no longer work (Community Representatives' FGD, 39, Kabupaten Ngawi, 22 April 2010)
It also holds true in Dusun Bakung, Belahan Rejo, Gresik, that the poor consists of the elderly widows
In this dusun, from the 25 households, 9 are headed by elderly widows and all are poor
In the past eight or three years, the indicators of poverty have slightly changed
One of the changes recorded in this study is that the poor now have a higher awareness in sending their children to school, at least up to junior high school level
This is brought about by the implementation of the Nine-Year Compulsory Education and BOS (School Operational Assistance) programs which made it possible for elementary and junior high schools to be tuition free
Free schools give the poor a better access to education than ever before
Nevertheless, this does not mean that the schools are completely cost-free
Some respondents said, Education is expensive
It is free on TV only; in reality, it is not (interview, male, 49, poor citizen, Kabupaten Gresik, 22 April 2010)
Some respondents even see education as the factor that causes poverty, as seen from the following statement, â€œAt first, we owned things [we were not poor], but because we wanted our children to get an education, we sold our assets to cover the expenses [and thus we became poor] (Poor Women's FGD, 53, Kabupaten Gresik, 24 April 2010)
As another change in the poverty indicator, in sample villages in East Java, specifically, having a motorcycle is no longer an important differentiating factor between welfare levels
Many of the poor have motorcycles now even though they obtained them through credits
The poor's housing condition has improved as well
Dirt floor is no longer a significant differentiating characteristic because many of the poor's houses have cemented or tile floor, especially in the parlor
4.1.2 The Causes of Poverty 
Poverty is a multidimensional problem; therefore, the factors causing it are also multidimensional
In the sample villages, the factors causing poverty are varied, but no apparent differentiating factors exist between all sample villages
Poverty is generally caused by a combination of the following factors
a) Having limited land or no land at all 
In all sample areas which economically rely on agriculture, an important factor causing poverty is not having any land or having limited land
This makes poor community members who do not have land and lack other skills become seasonal farm hands
Previous quotations state that the income generated by farm hands is not enough to fulfill basic needs
Combined with the lack of any other job opportunity outside the agricultural sector, the farm hands will likely stay poor
b) Limited job opportunities 
The limited number of job opportunities is a dominant factor in all sample areas causing the community members difficulty in freeing themselves from poverty
This in turn makes the poor who work as daily laborers (mostly farm hands) have no other job alternatives that pay better
c) Low education level
The low formal education level, most only being elementary school graduates or dropouts, coupled with the lack of other skills besides agricultural skills, is one of the factors causing poverty in almost all sample areas
Statements such as, The people are unintelligent, uneducated, so it is difficult for them to find a livelihood (Poor Women's FGD, 40, Kabupaten Gresik, 23 April 2010), or, Low education level, so they can't work in factories (Poor Women's FGD, 42, Kabupaten Gresik, 24 April 2010), are depictions of the educational characteristics of the poor who face difficulty to find any livelihood opportunity outside the agricultural sector
d) Limited capital 
In all sample areas, almost all the FGD participants and in-depth interviewees mentioned the lack of both fixed capital (rice fields, plantations, boats, etc.) and liquid capital (funds) as important factors that hamper the poor from escaping poverty
Besides the general factors above, some sample villages have special factors that cause poverty and/or make it difficult to overcome poverty
FGD participants in Desa Jambangan, Ngawi, mentioned high transportation costs as the result of bad road infrastructure as one of the important obstacles in their efforts to raise their income
The nonfunctional irrigation channels also hinder the agricultural productivity of this village
The intermediary traders' domination in the trade system causes the farmers to receive lower prices for their produce
In addition, the hilly terrain and the lack of irrigation in Nagari Bukit Bais, Solok, are the causes of the low agricultural productivity which makes the farmers' income lower and in turn makes them poor
4.2 Factors That Influence the Dynamics of Community Welfare 
Except in Kramat and Jambangan, all the sample villages show a trend of decreasing numbers of poor people, either in a massive or small scale, though not permanent, but dynamic according to the development of factors that cause poverty
Actually, several very important factors that influence the decrease in the number of poor people and/or the level of poverty in sample villages do not differ significantly
The following factors have a role in decreasing the level of poverty in the sample areas
a) The presence of new job opportunities and/or expansion of existing job opportunities 
The following cases reflect the expanding job opportunities which enable the poor to participate
(1) Exploitation of a gold mine by the people of Kabupaten Bombana, Southeast Sulawesi
For the people around the mine, including in Lampeantani and Teppeo, the presence of the gold mine did not only create job opportunities as miners, but also created other job opportunities such as traders and ojek (motorcycle taxi) drivers
The booming job opportunities happened in 2008 and 2009
In Lampeantani, which is approximately 10 km away from the mining site, the gold mine was the sole source of alternative jobs aside from the agricultural jobs
According to a participant of the Village Representatives' FGD in Kabupaten Bombana (39, 4 June 2010), between 2007 and 2009, the number of poor people in Lampeantani had decreased from 78% to 68%
At the moment, gold mining has lessened due to the government regulation that forbids community mining
Without the alternative jobs, there is a possibility that the poverty level will stop decreasing or even increase again
(2) The chance of becoming migrant workers in urban areas, either in cities close to or far from the village
In Desa Belahan Rejo, for example, many of the people become construction workers in Surabaya
Besides becoming domestic migrant workers, some village citizens also work abroad as migrant workers to obtain a better income
(3) Regional segregation (pemekaran wilayah) which creates new economic growth centers (the Dharmasraya case)
This gives a chance to the local people, including the poor, to obtain new jobs aside from getting better prices for their agricultural commodities
(4) The opening of new factories/plantations in the sample communities' surroundings
Some (oil palm) plantation investors in Southeast Sulawesi opened some plantations around the sample villages so that new job opportunities were available for the poor
Besides that, in Desa Belahan Rejo, since 2004, many farm hands have earned extra income from moonlighting as waste collectors thanks to the opening of some plants that receive wastes to recycle in that area
b) The increase in agricultural commodity prices 
The increase in the prices of plantation commodities (rubber, oil palm, and cocoa) and marine catch, especially in West Sumatra and Southeast Sulawesi, give a large contribution to the locals' income increase
This specifically started in the second semester of 2009 after the commodities' prices fell previously due to the global financial crisis
At the time of the crisis, the price of rubber in Nagari Sialang Gaung, West Sumatra, for example, was only Rp1,500/kg, but now it has reached Rp11,500/kg (Poor Women's FGD, 33, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, 13 May 2010)
A similar thing happened to the price of pokea (a sea mussel) in Labungga, Konawe Utara, Southeast Sulawesi
The price of pokea is now Rp7,000/can, quadruple the previous price, Rp1,500/can (Poor Women's FGD, 45, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, 5 June 2010)
c) Infrastructural improvements 
In some sample locations, there have been village road improvements
This condition has improved trade efficiency and eased access to the market
Transportation costs have decreased and the prices received by the farmers have increased
The improvement of welfare due to improvements in road infrastructure has happened in sample villages which previously had terrible roads
In Nagari Batu Palano, West Sumatra, a respondent said, the factor that has an influence on the change in the community's welfare level is transportation
With the transportation running smoothly, the people can reduce the cost of transporting their produce from the rice field to the market (Village Representatives' FGD, 54, Kabupaten Agam, 11 May 2010)
The increase in the quality and quantity of the rural economic infrastructure is a direct result of the programs/projects/assistance provided by the government
Specifically for the rural road infrastructure, some programs that have given a large contribution are the PNPM, JPD (Village Axis Road) program, stimulant funds, etc
d) Increase in agricultural productivity 
The agricultural productivity of some sample villages has increased 
This is due to the construction of irrigation infrastructure and the success of agricultural counseling
For example, in Nagari Sialang Gaung, Dharmasraya, West Sumatra, in 2007, the central government had built a technical irrigation network capable of irrigating 18,000 hectares of rice fields in West Sumatra and Jambi
The construction of these irrigation channels has increased the rice planting frequency from two harvests a year to three to four harvests a year
In Nagari Batu Palano, Agam, a Community Representatives' FGD participant (32, 11 May 2010) stated, The welfare betterment was supported by the change in planting patterns which happened in 1999 and by the smooth marketing
In the past, the people of Batu Palano only planted carrots, but after the training held by the Agriculture Office, they have started to plant tomatoes and corn. 
Besides the positive factors, in some sample villages, there have been factors that negatively influence the welfare level
In Desa Kramat, Gresik, the number of poor people has increased due to the pollution of the fish farms by the waste of factories that operate in the areas surrounding the village
The fishers' catch has also decreased due to the policy of Kabupaten Gresik government that bans the use of trawls, while in fact fishers from other kabupaten still use trawls in the Gresik waters
Thus, the fishers from Desa Kramat lose in the fish-catching competition and their income has drastically decreased
For Desa Sumbersari, Lumajang, one of the causes of the increasing number of poor people is the policy of agricultural mechanization in the Jatiroto Sugar Plant
The possibility for the locals to become seasonal workers in the plant has vanished
The local work force has also been marginalized from work opportunities because the rice wholesalers bring their own workers, shunning the use of locals
4.2.1 Government Programs/Assistance 
In the last eight years, both the central and regional governments have implemented various development programs that have a significant role in reducing poverty, or at least preventing the poor from becoming poorer
These programs can be grouped into two categories according to their targets
First, programs that are narrowly targeted such as Raskin, BLT, various credit assistance schemes, Gardu Taskin (Integrated Movements in Poverty Reduction), BOS, and Jamkesmas (Health Insurance for the Poor); and second, programs that are broadly targeted such as PNPM, JPD, ADD, stimulant funds, fertilizer subsidy, etc
All these programs aim to help make provision for the people and provide a wider space for them to enhance their economic activities
Every sample village has a high level of variance, not only in the number and kind of programs but also in the effectiveness
Nagari Sialang Gaung, Dharmasraya, for example, has received 16 kinds of programs within the duration of 2007-2010
On the contrary, Desa Lampenantani, Bombana, has just received five kinds of programs within the same duration
The difference in the number of programs received will of course give different impacts on the village people's welfare improvement
Besides the number and kind of programs received, the effectiveness of a similar program's implementation in every village is also different
Generally, the difference in a program's effectiveness is a result of the difference in the implementation of the program
Because this study does not deal directly with assessing the efficacy or usefulness of programs, but only assessing them indirectly through informants' perceptions, there is a large possibility of a biased judgment
Based upon this fact, the whole explanation on the effect of government programs in this study is not exclusive
As an example, the Raskin program in Nagari Sialang Gaung is not very effective because the majority of the recipients are not poor
This happens either because the poor are not included in the target group or because they cannot afford the rice
In Jorong Padang Bintungan, there has been no Raskin assistance even though the program was initiated six years ago
The Raskin rice is [supposed to be] for the poor, while in fact the people who receive it are not the poor, but the middle-class people and the rich
(Poor Men's FGD, 63, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, 13 May 2010) I have never received Raskin rice because I don't have enough money to buy it
Today, I only have Rp1,000, and even that was used by my child to buy snacks already
How can I afford Raskin rice
The wealthy people can buy lots of it, up to five sacks
(Interview, female, 38, poor citizen, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, 12 May 2010) One of the causes is because the targeting mechanism is the domain of the village arbiters or the village elite as described in the statement, The head of the jorong decides who gets the assistance
We are not consulted (Poor Men's FGD 52, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, 13 May 2010)
The Raskin program's low effectiveness due to the mistargeting also happened in Nagari Talang, Solok, as described in the following statement, There are still poor people who have not received assistance, while some people who don't deserve it get it (Poor People's FGD, 50, Kabupaten Solok, 14 May 2010)
The implementation of the Jamkesmas program in Nagari Sialang Gaung has also failed to reach its goals
This is depicted by a respondent, My child died because of it, Sir
My child was dying and they told me to deal with all sorts of bureaucracy, so, my child could not make it, Sir (Poor Women's FGD, 33, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, 13 May 2010)
The ineffective implementation of Jamkesmas also occurred in Desa Tempursari, Lumajang, which is seen from the statement, Even though we use Jamkesmas, a family member is still asked to vouch for us
If not, they won't help you (Middle-class Men's FGD, 42, 27 April 2010)
In some other sample villages, the two programs turned out to be highly effective
In Jorong Aro Kandikir, Agam, for example, from the eight existing programs, the local people ranked Raskin as the most effective program in helping the poor
In Nagari Talang, Solok, and Belahan Rejo, Gresik, the free health programs, both Jamkesmas and the local government's health program, were highly appreciated by the locals
The appreciation can be seen, among others, from the statement, free health insurance, so the people's awareness to seek medical assistance is is quite high compared to that of 2007
Now that the people are healthier, the harvests are also higher (Community Representatives' FGD, male, 35, Kabupaten Solok, 12 May 2010)
The same thing goes for BLT
Some sample villages regard it as an effective program because it gives assistance in the form of cash so that the utilization is very flexible, in line with the needs of the recipient's family
In Desa Sumbersari, Lumajang, BLT is the most effective program compared to the others (Poor Women's FGD, 40, 26 April 2010)
But on the contrary, the Middle-class Women's FGD results in Desa Tempursari, Lumajang, and the interview results with the head of Desa Tambusupa, Konawe Selatan, for example, state that BLT is not effective
In general, the reason is because BLT's benefits are short-lived (only to fulfill temporary consumptive needs) and do not help the people improve their economic condition
Based upon that, especially the poor give different responses towards different poverty reductions programs because they are basically heterogeneous
The chronically and persistently poor probably need social assistance more, while the transient poor will perhaps respond better to empowerment programs and opportunity openings, but at the same time need protection from shocks
The perception of the effectiveness of a certain program does not only differ between sample villages
Even in the same village, there are always different perceptions
In Desa Belahan Rejo, Gresik, the Poor Men's FGD came up with a conclusion that the three most useful programs for the people are (i) JPD, (ii) dam dredging, and (iii) Raskin, whereas the Poor Women's FGD chose (i) Raskin, (ii) road construction, and (iii) BOS
The Middle-class Women's FGD voted for (i) fertilizer subsidy, (ii) JPD, and (iii) Raskin, while the Middle-class Men's FGD concurred on (i) Jamkesmas, (ii) PNPM, and (iii) ADD
Once again, this phenomenon indicates that the people's judgment on the effectiveness of a certain program does not follow any pattern
The level of subjectivity is very prominent
This subjectivity level can occur because of personal experiences that may be very different from one another, but may also be caused by the interests of the concerned community groups
4.2.2 Other Activities/Village People's Initiatives 
Poverty is the problem of the entire nation
The country, casu quo the government, in accordance to its mandate, does have an obligation to reduce poverty and becomes the main actor
Nevertheless, government poverty reduction programs will be more optimal if they are supported by all the community elements, the private sector, NGOs, and other parties that care about poverty reduction
In all sample villages, unfortunately, all poverty reduction programs, both the direct and indirect ones, only come from the central and regional governments
For the last eight or three years, there has never been any institution outside the government that takes part in reducing poverty
The nonpoor local community does not have any institution purposely established to contribute to reducing poverty systematically
However, from a different perspective, the nonpoor local community has actually taken part in reducing poverty
This is at least reflected in the statement of a respondent that says that the haves have employed the poor as farm hands all this time
Without the works provided by the haves, the poor will get poorer (interview, male, 40, village head, Kabupaten Gresik, 23 April 2010)
Outside this employer-worker relationship, the community's concern towards the poor is still present in some sample villages
In Desa Gendol, Ngawi, for example, a poor citizen whose house was destroyed in a fire received a new house as the result of the other village citizens' mutual cooperation
Furthermore, the various community groups that exist in the village have no special agenda that targets to reduce poverty
There is only one village or two that have community groups having special activities that touch the life of the poor
In Batu Palano, Agam, there is the Bamus group whose activities, among others, include raising social funds in order to, among others, give financial assistance to orphans
The role of the local community that is very minimal in helping the poor is at least caused by two things
Firstly, the presence of the poor in the village neighborhood is considered as a natural phenomenon and not a social problem that needs to be solved together
Based on this, generally, the local community only feels sympathy towards them without making any real effort to solve the problem
Secondly, almost all informants in the sample villages, both the government officials and the poor, share the same opinion that the effort to reduce poverty is the responsibility of the government
For them, the government's responsibility is in the form of assistance programs
The stance of the people is probably the result of the old paradigm of poverty reduction programs
Most of the poverty reduction programs in the past used to be top-down in nature without including the community's participation
The government placed the community as the party that requires assistance and, on the other hand, it positioned itself as a Santa Claus who gives away charity
In other words, development programs that were aimed at the poor were more like a charity rather than an improvement to the capacity and/or independence of the poor
A development paradigm such as this in practice will create dependence which eventually makes the community suffer even more
4.2.3 Impact of PNPM on Poverty Reduction 
To change anew a development mechanism having a top-down nature, the government implemented PNPM that is participatory
Through this program, the community is given space to formulate development activities that suit its needs
Conceptually, this kind of development approach is expected to bring about greater positive impacts
In sample areas, in the broad sense, PNPM-Rural is divided into two, namely the physical infrastructure development program and capital assistance program in the form of SPP
In line with the form of the programs, the impact of both programs on poverty reduction also has different characters
In this context, development programs in general and assistance programs in particular, no matter how small, certainly benefit the community
What becomes the question is then how much does PNPM affect poverty reduction
Rural Infrastructure Development Program 
The open menu programs of PNPM Mandiri-Rural have so far been focused more on physical infrastructure developments
Consequently, in all sample areas, PNPM activities are usually around the building and/or rehabilitation of roads, bridges, PAUD buildings, TK buildings, and clean water facilities
Overall, these infrastructure developments are certainly advantageous for the local community
Even some informants in many sample villages place PNPM as one of the three programs that greatly benefit the community
The explanation in the previous part showed that the prime causes of poverty in sample areas are related to the scarce capital goods and financial capital, scarce job opportunities, and lowquality human resources
Related to this, Chapter VI (Villages' Primary Needs and Their Fulfillment) also explains that the villagers' primary needs in all sample locations generally revolve around the needs of capital, alternative job opportunities, skills training, free education, and excellent health services that are free
In this context, the various physical infrastructure developments of PNPM-Rural are not the kinds of developments that can directly solve the root of the poverty problem and/or fulfill the villagers' primary needs
Referring to the above facts, it can be said that the role of PNPM-Rural in reducing poverty is not centralized or dominant, but only peripheral
Direct indications regarding this matter are particularly reflected in FGD results and also in in-depth interviews with the poor group
When answering the question about the three kinds of programs that are most beneficial (effective) in improving the welfare of the poor group, the respondents' answers were generally around Raskin program, BLT, and other programs that were quite diverse
In many sample villages, PNPM did not make one of the three programs that were considered to have positif impact on the increase in the poor's welfare
In some sample villages, for example in Desa Sumbersari, Lumajang, the FGD participants even did not mention PNPM as a program that were running in their village because they did not know whether PNPM was eventually implemented or not
According to the FGD participants, they were once invited to formulate their village's primary needs and to decide the people to manage them in the initial stage of the PNPM implementation, but they had never been informed about the realization of the program
In this context, an FGD participant (male, 36, 26 April 2010) said, The poor are only needed in the program proposal stage only, while for the program's realization, they have never been consulted again. This shows that PNPM' existence is unfamiliar to the local poor community, let alone its benefits for them
For the village community in general and some of the poor in particular, the peripheral role of PNPM in improving the community's welfare takes place during the process of physical infrastructure development
This is reflected in the following statement, The poor community gets work opportunities even though they're only incidental
The community in general enjoys the better road condition (interview, male, 40, village head, Kabupaten Gresik, 23 April 2010)
However, the poor actually expect to get alternative permanent jobs, not the temporary ones as such in the PNPM
In addition to providing temporary job opportunities, the road construction in rural areas by PNPM also has had an impact on the decrease in marketing transportation costs as reflected in the statement,
In the past, the cost to carry the produce from the farm to the road was around Rp5,000, plus the transport cost to the market for Rp3,000
Now, with only Rp2,500, the produce can reach the market (Middle-class Men's FGD, 59, Kabupaten Agam, 14 May 2010)
For the poor who own an arable land, this decrease in transportation cost can more or less improve their income
But, for the poor whose profession is only a farm hand, this decrease has had little effect on their income
Therefore, PNPM infrastructure development has no direct impact on reducing the population of the poor
Out of the 90 FGDs and around 216 in-depth interviews, information regarding the role of PNPM in poverty reduction only revolves around this aspect
SPP Program 
In sample villages there are generally three kinds of understanding concerning SPP
First, SPP is considered a mandatory program or a prerequisite for the village to obtain a PNPM physical infrastructure project
Second, SPP repayment performance will determine whether in the following year the respective village will get an infrastructure project or not
Third, SPP is not a program exclusively designed for the poor
Based on these perspectives, SPP implementation emphasizes more on the smoothness of credit return rather than the empowerment aspect
As a result, this program is a bias in favor of the middle-class and wealthy groups
These groups are the ones that have the potency to return the credit smoothly, unlike the poor group
Besides, in some villages, there is a tendency that SPP implementation is only a formality to obtain a PNPM physical project
Based on these phenomena, the realities in the field show that SPP is not a program that aims at reducing poverty
In Desa Jambangan, Ngawi, for example, the number of villagers that became SPP recipients was 21 groups, each group having approximately 10 members
Even though the number of SPP recipients is quite big, it turns out that most of them do not belong to the poor community
In this matter, all respondents, both from the community and village officials, as well as program implementers stated that program recipients targeting was merely based on the smoothness of the loan return aspect, and was not based on the aspect of economic empowerment of the poor
Statements such as I just feel sorry for the poor
If they borrow money, but later cannot return it, they will be burdened with debts (Poor Women's FGD, 32, 22 April 2010) are indications of which community groups are actually the targets of SPP
The same thing was also stated by some village officials
Those who are supposed to receive SPP are the poor, but in practice, it is difficult to do because if one is poor and we give him/her money and he/she does not have any business [open a stall or trade], it will surely be a burden for them to return the money
(Interview, female, 48, village head, Kabupaten Ngawi, 22 April 2010) In this village, anyone can borrow SPP as long as they have a business and have the ability to return the loan
So, there is no stipulation stating that only the poor can get the loan
That's why, for SPP, we announce it in the village that whoever wants to get a loan is welcome
So, there is no appointment because if there is one and something goes wrong later on, we would be blamed
(Interview, male, 31, dusun head, Kabupaten Gresik, 24 April 2010) The design of the SPP program implementation that is not aimed at the poor is also reflected in the fact that in Desa Gendol, Ngawi, for example, the local UPK requires a motorcycle's BPKB (ownership certificate) as an assurance for the poor who want to borrow SPP
The requirement is obviously peculiar because even to fulfill the daily needs, the poor have difficulties, let alone owning a motorcycle
In other words, this requirement is only a way to prevent the poor from borrowing SPP because they are doubted to be able to return the loan
Another fact in Desa Sumbersari, Lumajang, showed that out of the nine Poor Women's FGD participants, only one participant was aware that there was an SPP program in their village
In Desa Tempursari, Lumajang, the poor do not have the courage to borrow SPP because they fear that they cannot return it; they do not have fixed monthly income
Related to this, there are some issues that cause the ineffectiveness of SPP in providing capital for the poor community
First, SPP's monthly instalment scheme does not suit the income pattern of the community who are generally farmers
Their work as farmers usually can only give them earnings every harvest time, that is, once every four months
Second, the kecamatan facilitators (FK) and village cadres (KPMD), who are supposed to raise awareness (conduct empowerment) so that the people will want to make use of the loan and then to guide them in running their business, have not done their job well
Third, it seems that the FK/KPMD who are expected to carry out the empowerment function do not have the required time and skills to guide the creditors so that they can make use of the loan productively
Based on that, all the while, SPP has appeared only as a program to give away funds to the community without accompanied by the aspect of economic guidance or empowerment for the people who receive the loan
For the poor who happen to get the SPP loan, the impression is that the program has instead deceived them into becoming powerless and this surely is against the spirit of PNPM itself that is based on the empowerment aspect
SPP's powerlessness, seen both from its entity and recipients, is depicted by the following quotations
What happened was different from the motto
The motto is poverty reduction
Those who should be given the loan are the poor, but the evidence showed the opposite
The assistance is supposed to empower the poor, but the poor were not given the PNPM loan instead 
(Poor Men's FGD, 46, Kabupaten Ngawi, 24 April 2010) In PNPM [SPP], we have to be good at lying, so we can get the assistance
Meaning that when we are asked about our monthly income to see whether we can return the loan or not, we have to lie by saying that our income is high, so we are considered able to pay the instalment (of SPP)
In fact, our income is not high
This has been proven; there are many members [of SPP] who got a two-million-rupiah loan because they lied about their income
And I know that their income is not that much
As a result, this village had a payment due up to 15 million rupiah so that Desa Lalembo got sanctioned in that it cannot propose a physical development project
The kecamatan head lent his hand in an effort to return the loan
(Interview, male 24, middle-class citizen, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, 7 June 2010) I got Rp500.000
I belonged to the vegetable trading group, but I did not think it was enough for capital
Therefore, I used it to buy rice
So, I quit selling vegetables
To return the loan, I looked for a side job as a log carrier
I was paid Rp40.000 per day
I used this money to pay for the PNPM instalment
(Interview, male, 48, RT head, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, 4 June 2010) 
I had to buy clothes and school equipment for the children
That's why, I was allowed to borrow money from SPP
(Poor Men's FGD, 31, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, 12 May 2010) 
That's the way it is
My wife became a member, but I was the one who managed the capital
My wife could not sell vegetables
(Interview, male, 48, RT head, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, 4 June 2010) Various explanations and quotations above state that SPP program's implementation has been so far unable to reach its objective in supporting the economic activities of poor women and the poor group in general
Yet, the Technical Guidelines for the Operation (PTO) of PNPM Mandiri-Rural state that the visions as well as the objectives of the program which clearly includes SPP are to improve the welfare and job opportunities of the rural poor community
What makes it worse is that because the implementation of SPP is a bias in favor of the middle-class and wealthy groups and it puts forward the smooth flowing of instalment payments as the criteria of success of the program, the existence of the poor is in fact exploited by certain parties for their personal gains
This is proven by the following statement
So, it happened that there was an individual from this village who borrowed money on behalf of several people up to around 10 million rupiah
Then, he ran away
The village office was forced to pay for his debt (interview, male, 31, dusun head, Kabupaten Gresik, 24 April 2010)
ACCESS TO AND QUALITY OF PUBLIC FACILITIES IN THE VILLAGE 
The availability of and access to public service facilities in the study areas are not equal
Out of the three provinces that became the study areas, the Province of Southeast Sulawesi has relatively limited infrastructure, while the infrastructure in the Province of East Java and West Sumatra is adequate even though its quality still needs improvement
This chapter will discuss the access to and quality of various public services in the study areas that cover the infrastructure of market, road, education and health services, clean water, and population administration service
5.1 Access to Market 
Even though they are part of the rural areas, no sample villages can still be categorized as a subsistent village
This means that the villagers surely need the market, both as a physical medium where trade occurs and an institution that mediates exchange, to trade goods and services to fulfill needs
The communities in the sample villages generally do not experience major difficulties in accessing the market in order to get their daily needs because already provided in their surrounding are market facilities which are relatively accessible
The difference is that there are some villages that are closer to the market and there are those that are more distant to the market
Besides, communities that are closer to the city, either the kecamatan or the kabupaten, have more advantages in that they are closer to the markets that are open daily from morning to afternoon
Communities who live in the villages that are relatively distant from city centers can only access the market on market days, which are once to thrice a week, with restricted operating hours
The past eight or three years have shown that there has been a tendency of an easier access for the community to the available markets
The impact of this change is that the community can gain advantage since they can save up their transportation funds, and get a higher sale price for their agricultural produce and a lower buying price for consumer goods
Some comments from the community reflect this tendency
In the last eight or three years, access to the market is really easy because the road facilities are already good and this is supported by the peddlers who sell people's daily needs
(Interview, male, 46, community figure, Kabupaten Gresik, 22 April 2010) It's close, 1 km
Two kilometers is the farthest, from Wawoluri, that is
We usually go on foot together or ride along a neighbor's motorcycle that is going the same direction
We go to the market twice a week on market days, Thursday in the kelurahan, Tuesday in Wawoluri
Usually, I just shop for daily needs in the market because I sell my vegetables directly from the garden
My friends come to buy my vegetables and sell them at the market
This year, it's getting better because there is another market on Saturday in Desa Lembo
So, I can sell vegetables thrice a week at the garden
(Interview, female, 28, middle-class citizen, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, 6 June 2010) I use the car [cigak baruak]
It costs Rp4,000 to Rp6,000, depending on the driver
Some will accept Rp4,000, but there are others who ask for more up to Rp6,000
Now, I ride a motorcycle more often because I have bought one
(Interview, male, 44, RTSM, Kabupaten Solok, 16 May 2010) The community has no problem with the access to the market because there are several markets that can be accessed by the community in this kecamatan
There was even a PNPM implementation whose activity was to rehabilitate the market like the one in Desa Tanjung Widoro
It opens every market day
Looking at it, for the past three years, the access has in fact been getting better because there are markets that are expanded and organized
(Interview, male, 29, FK, Kabupaten Gresik, 21 April 2010) Based on the above comments, there are at least four factors that support easier access to the market
Firstly, the numerous programs of road/bridge infrastructure developments, some of which are PNPM projects, help people from having to go through wet, rock-strewn, and potholed roads in order to reach the market
Secondly, the community has been able to own a means of transportation, such as a motorcycle, more easily (through the lenient requirement to motorcycle ownership credit), which has an effect on the much faster and smoother access to the market
Thirdly, not only can the community access the market easily, but the market can also easily come to the community
This is seen from the increasing number of peddlers who are using motorcycles or cars more often to come to the villages to sell various kinds of consumer goods
Fourthly, the number and frequency of market activities, as well as their quality, are increasing
In the past, markets in some villages were only open once a week, but in the last eight or three years, there have been some that are open twice a week or more, just like what occurs in Kabupaten Agam and Konawe Utara
Besides, the market buildings have been improved and there have even been developments of new markets like what happened in Konawe Selatan, Gresik, and Lumajang
The improving community access to the market in some sample villages is attributed to the role of PNPM that has improved the quality of the market buildings, eased access to the market, and smoothed market penetration to the community or even created a market in the village as described in the following
a) The quality of market is improving because in some regions, PNPM has built new markets and renovate or expand the existing markets such as what happened in study villages in Ngawi, Gresik, Konawe Utara, and Konawe Selatan
b) Community's access to the market to sell agricultural produce or buy consumer goods is getting easier because PNPM has repaired the roads in the village and the roads included in JUT and constructed or fixed bridges connecting the village to the market
This condition occurs in almost all the study villages
c) Market penetration is getting smoother because with the road and bridge repairs, intermediary traders and distributors of consumer goods can directly visit the village to buy the community's agricultural and plantation products or distribute the community's consumer goods directly to the stalls in village
d) PNPM through the SPP program has also contributed to encouraging some villagers who accepted the loans to change or add professions, mostly, to become traders
This is because the business that one must own, as a prerequisite to get SPP, is always understood as a new business, which is different from what they have been doing all this time, namely farming
5.2 Road Infrastructure and Transportation
The condition of road infrastructure in the study locations is generally quite good at present, especially in East Java and West Sumatra
In East Java, the village roads and even the dusun roads are generally already asphalted
In some villages, such as in Tempursari, the pathways have used paving blocks
Although not as good as the roads in East Java, the roads in West Sumatra are adequate
The main road in the villages and several strategic roads in the dusun are already asphalted or at least hardened
In Southeast Sulawesi, except in Konawe Selatan, many of the village and dusun roads have not been asphalted, are damaged, have only been hardened, and, in Kabupaten Bombana, are only dirt roads
Almost along the 100-kilometer road that connects Kota Kendari and Kabupaten Bombana is full with big potholes
What an irony; Southeast Sulawesi, as the biggest producer of asphalt in Indonesia, has many roads that have not been asphalted
In some sample areas were found damaged intervillage roads and they are seemed abandoned
In Tempursari, Lumajang; Teppeo, Bombana; and Labungga, Konawe Utara, some of the intervillage connecting roads are slightly damaged and some others are heavily damaged
According to informants, the reason why most intervillage roads are relatively neglected is because there is no attention from the government being responsible for the roads, both the regional government (for kecamatan, kabupaten, and provincial roads) and the central government (for national roads)
A number of road repair and improvement budgets that has come into the village such as PNPM, JPD, ADD, etc are usually allocated to fixing or building roads that are strategic for the villagers, namely the village axis road
PNPM funds, according to informants at the kecamatan level, can only be allocated to building roads within the village and cannot be used to construct intervillage roads
Another reason why the intervillage roads were neglected is because every village assumes that the road is not their responsibility and thus they feel reluctant to allocate their development budget for it
For villages that have good road infrastructure, it does not necessarily mean that transportation is no longer an obstacle because in these villages, for example, in Tempursari, Lumajang; Kramat, Gresik; and Tambusupa, Konawe Selatan, there is no public transportation that passes the village
This condition heavily burdens the people who do not own any private vehicle such as motorcycles or cars
However, this condition opens up a job opportunity for other community groups, such as ojek and becak (pedicab) drivers, who provide alternative transportation facilities for people who do not own private means of transportation
However, compared to the condition eight or three years ago, the present condition of the roads as well as the transportation in the sample villages has experienced a rapid progress
Most of the repairs of the roads within the villages in the sample villages occurred in the past eight or three years
PNPM's contribution towards the improvement of road infrastructure is mainly related to the construction of inter-dusun roads and farm roads, some of which are also inter-dusun roads, while the main road in the village is usually constructed by using other source of funding, such as the JPD program
The following are comments from the informants regarding the changes
At present, there has just been a road repair because this road is included in the provincial roads that will still be widened
In this village, there is one village road and one farm road
The village road is mud-spattered when it's raining
The farm road is still in good condition; the road was hardened once in 2000s
I forgot the year
The transportation that is usually used is car or ojek
Sometimes people go on foot
Ojek costs Rp5,000 to go to the market
To Kasipute, the ojek rent is Rp20,000 for a round trip
(Interview, male, 44, TPK, Kabupaten Bombana, 5 June 2010) The road in this village is heavily damaged
Since the segregation of Kabupaten Bombana, the road in this village has never been repaired
The current village road is the result of a project when Bombana was still part of Kabupaten Buton 
(Interview, male, 51, RTSM, Kabupaten Bombana, 5 June 2010) There are still dirt roads
For example, the road to Siaro-aro is still full of dirt
(Interview, male, 43, jorong head, Kabupaten Solok, 14 May 2010) In terms of roads, there have been many improvements
Now, they are quite satisfactory
What lacks is the means of transportation
The impact on the economy is the smooth selling of consumer goods
(Interview, male, 28, RT head, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, 5 June 2010) The roads to this market from the villages around Tempursari are already good, except for some roads, such as the road coming from Pronojiwo [passing Desa Kaliuling towards the direction of Pasar (Market) Tempursari]
The problem is that there is no public transportation from the village to the market because what is available is only ojek
The inter-kecamatan access is awful, both for the roads to Pronojiwo [heading to Malang or returning to Lumajang] and to Pasitian heading towards Lumajang
However, PNPM cannot build this road because it is a kabupaten road
(Interview, male, 42, FK, Kabupaten Lumajang, 22 April 2010) 
5.3 Education Services 
For the informants, the availability of basic education facilities from elementary schools (SD) to junior high schools (SMP) in sample villages is quite satisfactory
Compared to eight or three years ago, the condition has experienced an improvement
Of all the sample villages, there is only one village in Konawe Utara that does not have an SD in the village
Aside from that, all villages even have more than one SD
SMP is usually not available in the villages, but available only in the villages that are the centers of the kecamatan
The senior high school (SMA) is even fewer in number
Usually, there is only one in every kecamatan or there is even none, so students from the village have to go to the kabupaten city
Some villages, such as Tambusupa, Konawe Selatan, which are located quite far from the closest SMP had made a breakthrough by building an SD-SMP Satu Atap
The SD and SMP are integrated in the same school, so after the SD students graduate, they can go directly to the SMP in the same school
For SD, there has been one since years ago, but SMP was just opened in 2008
It is still called SMP Satu Atap
Facilities for the SMP are still very much inadequate, both in terms of human resources [teachers] and computers that are lacking
For SMA, up to the present time, there has been none in Sindang Kasih
Students are very active to go to school
(Interview, female, 42, community figure, Kabupaten Konawe Selatan, 7 June 2010) Public facilities such as the road and bridge infrastructure, and means of transportation that have been getting better for the past three years have uplifted the enthusiasm of the students to attend school
(Interview, female, community figure, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, 14 May 2010) The education facilities from year to year have been improving because if it is seen from the physical condition of the school at present, it is much better and tidier
(Interview, male, 75, community figure, Kabupaten Agam, 16 May 2010) Today, it's embarrassing to only graduate from SD
It will be difficult to get a job
It's different from the past
Back then, an SD graduate can be an SD teacher
(Interview, male, 52, middle-class citizen, Kabupaten Ngawi, 26 April 2010) The community's interest in pre-SD education, namely TK and PAUD, today is high
In almost all study villages, there is one or at least a plan to build a pre-SD school
Quite many PNPM/PPK projects have been allocated to the building of pre-SD schools
As seen in Appendix 1, there are 12 open menu projects in 8 villages out of the 18 study villages that build/renovate education facilities for these pre-SD schools
The great interest of the community in pre-SD education is partly caused by the community's awareness that children at a very early age need a medium for education as well as playing
In addition, it is also because it has become the latest trend to enroll children at a very early age; even though this kind of awareness is mostly present among the middle and upper classes
An informant in Konawe Selatan stated, In the past, Sir, children went to school on foot
Now, almost all go to school by motorcycle, wear clean clothes, and wear shoes that are not splattered by mud
It seems that children are more diligent to go to school
What's most evident is actually the impact of the existence of TK
So, children do not have to start from scratch in SD
Well .. that TK which was built by PNPM
(Interview, male, 58, community figure, Kabupaten Konawe Selatan, 5 June 2010) 
In villages categorized as poor with a relatively small number of population, there is usually only one SD or two such as in Batu Palano, Kabupaten Agam; Tambusupa, Kabupaten Konawe Selatan; and Bukit Bais, Kabupaten Solok
Villages that are categorized as wealthy can have more than two or three schools for every education level
Desa Tempursari in Lumajang, for example, has three PAUD, six TK, and five SD, one of which is MIN (public Islamic elementary school) and one Christian SD
For the SMP level, there is one SMPK, one MTsN (public Islamic junior high school) and one MTsS (private Islamic junior high school)
For the SMA level, there is one Christian SMA and SMA Mataram
In addition, in this village, there have been several extension campuses of some universities, namely Unkris (Christian University) which stopped operating in 1999, Unida Malang which had operated until 2009, and STIT which is still operating up to today with lecture days on Saturdays and Sundays
The people in villages that only have one or two schools usually send their children to the nearby schools, while the community members in villages that are relatively close to the urban areas which provide more alternatives of schools are inclined to send their children to schools in the cities considered to have better quality
This tendency appears to occur among the middle to upper class societies who have more aspiration towards the quality, aside from being able to support the extra education costs
An informant depicted, Seen from the physical development, the education facilities in this jorong are getting better, but the number of students is getting smaller because the community prefers sending their children to the cities to their own villages
(Interview, female, 29, middle-class citizen, Kabupaten Agam, 17 May 2010) On the other hand, the enrollment rate of school-age children is getting higher
Particularly for the basic education level, all informants acknowledged that there are almost no children who do not attend school
Male and female discrimination has already been discarded by the community
In addition to the higher awareness of the parents and the more accessible schools are, this high level of enrollment rate is also affected by the existence of the BOS program that helps ease the burden of parents
If there are village people who complain about the cost of education, this is usually related to the fulfillment of school supporting needs, such as uniforms, books, pocket money, and also transportation costs, that are not covered by BOS
Ten out of the 18 study villages expressed that among the village primary needs is scholarship for poor students
For the SMA level, the enrollment rate, especially, of children from poor households is relatively low
This is due to the high education cost at the SMA level and the lack of support of programs like BOS
The following are depictions of education access at the study locations
For SD and SMP, all boys and girls get equal chance to schooling, depending on the children, whether they really want to go to school or not
While for SMA, not all can attend school because the main obstacle is the tuition fee
That's why most boys are unenthusiastic to go to school
(Interview, female, 29, middle-class citizen, Kabupaten Solok, 16 May 2010) 
The enrollment rates for the last three years, both for boys and girls, in SD and SMP have been improving due to the available facilities of SD and SMP buildings in Desa B, besides the support of the BOS program that helps students from poor households with free tuition fee and school equipment [uniform, shoes, bag, stationery] assistance
(Interview, male, 45, village head, Kabupaten Lumajang, 21 April 2010) The direct role of PNPM in improving the access to and quality of education services is by assisting in the building/renovation of school buildings
However, as described above, PNPM projects that are related to education are all allocated for education development at the pre-SD level, such as PAUD and TK/RA
Only one village in Konawe Utara does not have an SD in its area and is planning to build one, although the fact is that it has not been realized yet
The tendency as such is because the primary basic education facilities for the community, namely SD and SMP, are already available in the village or at least easily accessible
The indirect role of PNPM-Rural is by creating a smoother access for students to school through road improvement
As depicted in the above quotations, the community believes that the betterment of roads passing through the schools has increased students' motivation to diligently go to school
5.4 Health Services 
The availability of health services in the study villages is considered quite adequate by the informants, except in some villages in Southeast Sulawesi
In Desa Teppeo and Lampeantani, Kabupaten Bombana; and Desa Lalembo, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, health facilities such as village maternity posts (polindes) along with their midwives are not available
Community's access to the puskesmas is also difficult because of its relatively distant location
In general, health facilities that are usually available in every village is polindes or nagari health center (puskesri), such as those in the nagari in West Sumatra, along with its midwife, while the posyandu is available in every dusun
Some villages that are distant from kecamatan centers and puskesmas, such as Desa Labungga, Konawe Utara, have a secondary puskesmas (pustu)
Only one puskesmas is usually available for one kecamatan and it is located in the village where the kecamatan center is
In addition to the government's health services, in developed villages, such as Tempursari, Sindang Kasih, Talang, etc., there are usually nongovernment health services, such as the private practices of doctors and midwives (not the village midwives), pharmacies, and maternity homes
Related to these health facilities, the people in almost half of the study villages have several complaints, both those that are related to infrastructure availability and health service quality
In the matter of infrastructure availability, not all villages have a permanent building for polindes, let alone posyandu, as in the case of Desa Labungga and Lalembo
Villages that do not own a polindes usually do not have midwives and so the community has to go to the puskesmas
Villages that do not have a building for posyandu activities usually hold the activities in a resident's house or in the village office
This means that villagers who live far from the village office have to travel a relatively great distance
However, in the past three years, some villages have received assistance to build polindes, both from the regional budget and through program assistance such as PNPM
These villages include Tambusupa, Bukit Bais, and Lalembo
In villages such as Bukit Bais, Labungga, Lampeantani, and Teppeo, informants also complained about the unavailable village/nagari midwife
Even if there is one, the midwife does not live in the village/nagari, so the villagers cannot get her service outside work hours
The community also felt that the services received by Jamkesmas card holders are not as good as those given to patients who pay cash
The services referred to are such as giving low quality medicine, prioritizing other patients even though the Jamkesmas holders have come first, or even rejecting patients from getting services at the hospital just like what happened to the residents of a village in Lumajang
Those who use Jamkesmas are treated later
But [that happens] in the hospital
But not here in the puskesmas (interview, male, 35, RT head, Kabupaten Lumajang, 26 April 2010)
Another complaint is the midwife's reluctance to give free services outside her work hours
In some villages, there is even a tendency that during work hours, the midwife prefers to refer patients who come to her for medication to the puskesmas, let alone outside work hours
According to the villagers, this tendency occurs because the midwife does not want to work to hard
Even though some informants complained about some health service aspects, in general, they think that compared to eight or three years ago, the health service condition at present is relatively better
In the past three years, some study villages have received many health infrastructure construction as well as renovation assistance such as those received by Desa Tambusupa, Bukit Bais, and Lalembo
The following quotation depicts these changes
If it's about health, today the condition is better than it was a few years back because there is a midwife in each jorong; there is Jamkesmas for the poor community
Posyandu is held routinely once in two weeks
This health facility improvement has the same impact on men and women because the jorong's midwife does not only provide maternity services, but also serves people who ask for fever medicine
(Interview, male, RTM, Kabupaten Solok, 15 May 2010) What is actually not peculiar is the fact that although health services are already available throughout the villages, the existence of traditional healers still persists
Some community members often still ask for medicine from the traditional healer rather than from a midwife or a doctor
The reasons why there are still people who use the traditional healer's services are not only because their awareness of and knowledge about modern health is limited, but also because of the cost factor
Even though there is no further information about who use the services of the traditional healer, the probability is that these people are the villagers who do not have a Jamkesmas card or those who have it but are hindered to access the available health facilities
An informant elaborated, If it's just a common illness, then I go to the traditional healer
If it's a disease that cannot be cured by the puffing of the traditional healer, then I go to the puskesmas (interview, male, 38, village secretary, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, 6 June 2010)
The direct contribution of PNPM in the health sector in the study areas is the construction of building facilities for the polindes and posyandu
Three out of the 18 sample villages have received projects related to health infrastructure
The indirect contribution of PNPM is the construction of roads that pass through health facilities and thus community' access to health facilities can be smoother and faster
5.5 Clean Water Facilities 
Community's access to clean water is one of the complicated problems in the sample villages
This complication occurs because the problem is experienced only by a small number of people who live in a certain part of the villages that does not have any access to clean water, both the clean water that is provided by the government through the PDAM and the clean water that can be provided by the people themselves such as the traditional well
This access is not available sometimes because it cannot be reached by the PDAM pipe network and/or the area does not have any water content that is passable or fit to consume
In Desa Tempursari, for example, there are two or three RW that cannot be accessed by the PDAM pipe network, while not all the locals who tried to dig up a well could find water and so they had to share the neighbor's well
Desa Lalembo in Konawe Utara, Desa Teppeo in Bombana, Desa Batu Palano in Agam, and Jorong Piruko in Dharmasraya actually have an abundant water supply, but the water is of bad quality because it is salty and muddy, and contains so much iron that it cannot be consumed
The following quotations provide descriptions about this problem
Since the past, the clean water problem has been a problem that cannot be solved in this village
There is no clean water network in this village
The community can only count on the water from the wells in the people's houses
It's just that the well water tastes salty because this village is near the sea
(Interview, male, 55, community figure, Kabupaten Bombana, 6 June 2010) For clean water, the people here could hardly get it
All this time, we get water from the river or a well
(Interview, male, 33, RTM, Kabupaten Bombana, 6 June 2010) [We get] quite good service
Only in some points, it is not, such as in Jorong Giring-Giring and Aceh Baru
But, for Aceh Baru, it has just got access and has got the Pansimas project
(Interview, male, 60, wali nagari, Kabupaten Agam, 9 May 2010) The community members here use their own personal well at their own house, but the water is not really clean because the region is a swamp area
So, 65% of the water is not clean
(Interview, male, 30, RTSM, Kabupaten Dharmasraya, 14 May 2010) There hasn't been any clean water
In this house, there is no motorcycle
So, it's difficult to go to get water from Sawa [Kelurahan Sawa] since it's far away
(Interview, female, 48, community figure, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, 9 June 2010) The PDAM's clean water has been felt inadequate since years ago
The PDAM pipes stopped at RT 7 and they are not continued to RT 8 because of the lack of funds/program from the top
Digging up a well for RT 7 does not seem effective because you have to dig a really deep well to find water
Today, what the community members in RT 8 have been doing is making a simple waterway to channel water from the closest water source from their area to fulfill the community's needs for water
(Interview, male, RT head, Kabupaten Ngawi, 21 April 2010) Some villages that are at present experiencing lack of clean water had once received assistance in the form of clean water pipelining such as Lalembo that received assistance from Yayasan Insani in 2001, but then the pipes were damaged
Desa Tambusupa also received clean water assistance from CRD, but it did not work because the water source was salty
This village also once received water pumping assistance, but, according to some informants, the pumps were controlled by some of the village elite members
Some other villages have received assistance recently, such as Desa Batu Palano which has received the Pamsimas program; the program is underway at present
There are also villages that are making efforts to improve the clean water access through ADD, such as the case in Sumbersari, Lumajang
Only Desa Labungga already received clean water pipelining assistance in 2004 when PNPM was still called PPK
Desa Teppeo and Lampeantani in Bombana had already made a proposal as well, but until now, they have not been granted the budget for its construction
Actually, some people from other villages that have a clean water supply problem have proposed to make clean water access improvement as PNPM's priority
However, some of the proposals did not make it because of a number of reasons
First, after the costs had been estimated, the proposed project required a lot of funds
For example, the project budget proposed by one of the sample villages amounted to Rp700 million so that it was rejected in the MAD
If this project had been passed, this one project alone would have taken up most of the PNPM budget in the respective kecamatan
Secondly, the urgency of the clean water supply was only felt by some people in a certain part of the village, so during the process to determine the ranks of the proposed projects, they lost
This was what happened in Desa Batu Palano, Kabupaten Agam
5.6 Administration 
The people in the sample villages can attend to the administration affairs quite easily and fast
The matters regarding administration that are often accessed by the community are those related to the arrangement of KTP (ID card), KK (family card), and notification letters (letters to notice poverty, buying and selling transactions, and death)
The needs for good and fast administration services have been greatly felt by the community lately
This occurred as a result of several factors such as the direct election process that required KTP ownership, government as well as private assistance that also required complete population administration papers, and the more stringent policy of population administration regulation in general
The following is the elaboration of an informant
For KK, the villagers have only started to make one after the LPG tube [assistance] had started, more or less in the past one or two years
This is because to get the LPG tube, one must have a KK
That's why, this encouraged people to make one
Aside from that, the administrative arrangement of KTP today also requires KK ownership as a prerequisite
This requirement had been more effectively applied since 2009
(Interview, male, RT head, Kabupaten Ngawi, 21 April 2010) 
Some of the administration affairs can be taken care of in the village office, while some others have to be dealt with in the kecamatan office, such as the arrangement of KTP
Some affairs even have to be taken to the kabupaten office, such as the arrangement of KK
If only for the administration services, the expense that is borne by the community is only around Rp5,000-Rp10,000
However, if it includes â€œcigarette money and transportation costs, especially if they have to take care of the matter at the kabupaten office, the people living far from the capital of the kabupaten, such as Batu Palano in Agam, Tempursari in Lumajang, or Tambusupa in Konawe Selatan, have to spend more than Rp100,000
Nevertheless, in general, most informants admitted that compared to eight or three years ago, the present condition is much better, in the sense that it is faster now, although there are a number of problems, such as the presence of officials who asked for cigarette money, lack of discipline in terms of time among the officials, and for KK, the requirement to deal with the matter at the distant kabupaten office
The following statements from the informants from various villages depict their opinions
It's easy because there is a high commitment from the village officials to provide services to the maximum quality
Now, making a KTP is easy without having to wait long
If the community wants to make a KTP, they can ask a village official to take care of it without giving any cigarette money
(Interview, female, 58, RTM, Kabupaten Gresik, 26 April 2010) Arrangement of population administration is handled quickly
Only when the official is not present, the arrangement takes up some time
But now, for the arrangement of KTP, you have to go to the kabupaten and this is burdensome because it is far
(Interview, male, 42, FK, Kabupaten Lumajang, 22 April 2010) I think that administration matters are not difficult anymore because people just need to go to the village head's house and take care of the papers and they can be finished on the very same day
(Interview, female, 54, RTM, Kabupaten Konawe Selatan, 6 June 2010) It's getting easier now because you used to have to go to Unaha [the capital of Kabupaten Konawe]
After the kabupaten was segregated, it is closer now, that is, in Wanggudu
The cost to make a KTP is around Rp30,000-Rp50,000
The cost for KK arrangement is also the same
In the village and kecamatan, you give only as much as you wish
If you don't give any, it's okay
(Interview, male, 28, RT head, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, 5 June 2010) The nagari administration has made improvements such as the services that are getting better
In addition, the officials' working hours have also started to follow the schedule
Three years ago, there were still nagari administration officials who asked for cigarette money to the people for any service
(Interview, male, 34, community figure, Kabupaten Agam, 15 May 2010) In the village, the administration process is simple, but in the kecamatan, such as when taking care of a KTP, it is difficult
It takes up a lot of time
(Interview, male, 40, RTM, Kabupaten Ngawi, 25 April 2010) Well, service of this kind [administration arrangement in the village requiring cigarette money] remains the same
(Interview, male, 49, RTM, Kabupaten Gresik, 26 April 2010) The more improved administration services in various study villages are, among others, because the office is more equipped, the village/nagari officials are more skilled, and the welfare level of the officials is higher
A summary of an interesting comment from a community figure in Lumajang depicts this matter
Improvement of administration services at the village level can be felt by all the village people without exception for the last eight years
This change is caused by several factors, namely 
(1) tools/equipment that are becoming more adequate with a computerized system; 
(2) officials that are more competent; previously, village officials were appointed, but now they go through a selection process; 
(3) the kabupaten officials giving training on village administration
This condition speeds up all villagers' administration affairs
For example, in the past, it took days to get a KTP finished, but now it can be finished in only one day
(Interview, male, 56, community figure, Kabupaten Lumajang, 23 April 2010) Besides the factors mentioned by the informant above, there is also the factor of the officials' salary raise, such as what happened in Batu Palano, Kabupaten Agam
According to its wali nagari, originally, the nagari officials were paid Rp300,000-Rp500,000 a month
At present, their salary is on average more than Rp700,000 a month so that their commitment towards their job and their discipline in terms of time are improving
There is a little change in the services, but it is hard to make a self-judgement at the moment because the present administration has just been working for less than a month, but from the administration side, there has been an effort to improve services through the improvement of the nagari officials' welfare
There has been a salary increase of around 50% from Rp500.000 to Rp750.000
(Interview, male, 60, wali nagari, Kabupaten Agam, 9 May 2010) However, the condition as explained by the informants above does not apply in all villages
Villages whose office has been equipped by computers are only found in East Java and West Sumatra
In Southeast Sulawesi, there are a number of sample villages that do not even have an office such as in Teppeo, Bombana, and thus administration affairs are done at the village head's house
Most village heads in this province run government activities from their house, even if there is a village office
The village office in Desa Tambusupa is even quite spacious and well equipped
In most of the villages, the village administration is run only by the village head
The other village officials only play a complementary role in the structure and almost lack any function
The same thing also happened to the other factors such as competency, training, and salary raise
Not all kabupaten apply the same policy for their village administrations
This seems to be affected by the commitment and capacity of the kabupaten government in providing support for their village administrations
This happens because some things such as salary and training depend a lot on the policy and budgeting of the regional government
If ranked, in general, East Java is the region that has the best village administration, followed by the nagari administration in West Sumatra and finally the village administration in Southeast Sulawesi
The relatively good village administration in East Java is very much related to the big budget commitment of the regional government to encourage improvement in the village administration by increasing the salary of the village officials and by giving honorarium to officials under the dusun administration (RW and RT heads)
In addition, most village administrations in Java will also get extra income from the tanah lungguh which can be quite a lot
The village head in Tempursari, for example, receive an 8-hectare tanah lungguh, the village secretary 6 hectares, and the village affairs heads and the dusun heads 4 hectares each
Even though not all villages in Java have tanah lungguh as wide as the tanah lungguh in Tempursari, the existence of extra incentive for village officials in the Java region in general, among others, explains why the election of village heads in the region is very competitive
Outside Java, the position of a village head is not fought over as fiercely as it is in Java
Some village heads interviewed admitted that they became a village head after they were forced to
There is also a village head who can no longer provide for his family maximally because he became a village head, while the salary that he gets only amounts to no more than Rp600,000 per month which is sometimes not paid every month
In Lalembo, the salary of village officials is even only around Rp200,000-Rp300,000 for two/three months
This happens because of the big number of village officials
An informant described that almost all families in the village had a family member who became a village official
The different institutional capacities between village administrations explain why the administration services outside Java are not as good as those in Java
Therefore, the above quotations regarding the community's satisfaction over the village administration's services must be placed within the framework of this difference in capacity
The satisfaction as expressed by the informants in Java region has different quality nuances from those of the satisfaction expressed by communities outside Java
VILLAGE PRIMARY NEEDS AND THEIR FULFILLMENT 
This part will discuss various village primary needs and their fulfillment
The assumption of PNPM is that rural community empowerment can be observed if the villagers are able to formulate their needs and work independently to fulfill them, both individually and collectively
On the contrary, the inability of rural community to formulate their primary needs and independently fulfill them is evidence that the empowerment undertaken by several programs that claim to conduct empowerment has not succeeded
The various proofs described previously, and more specifically in this chapter, show that the empowerment has not succeeded
The last part of this chapter will give further explanation about the failure of the empowerment
6.1 Priorities of Village Needs 
In general, the primary needs of the poor community in every village are almost the same
There were only a few needs that were specifically suggested by one village only
Most of the needs appeared in four or more villages
The order of needs ranging from the most to the least needed by the village is capital, alternative job opportunities, skills training, free education, and free and excellent health services (for a more complete list on the order of needs based on their frequency of emergence, see Appendix 2)
Both the poor and middle-class groups equally need capital assistance as reflected in the results of FGD with poor and middle-class communities
The difference is that the middleclass group understands that capital assistance has an interest and must be returned
The kind of capital assistance that they seek is the one with low interest and flexible repayment
On the contrary, the poor citizens often perceive capital assistance as something that they do not have to return
It is understandable if there were only few poor citizens that tried to access capital credit assistance offered by such programs as Savings and Loan-Urban Economic Unit (UEPSP) and SPP-PNPM because the capital must be returned along with the interest
Therefore, when they ask for capital assistance, what they mean is capital assistance that they do not have to return
An informant said, What we need is real assistance
Not the one that requires us to borrow the money
If it is assistance, why do we have to borrow the money
Ndadak ngembalikan [Suddenly we have to return it]
The women said, Walah nek ono wong mbantu, sing gak nyaur [If there is assistance, why not assistance that does not need to be returned]
If we borrow money, some of the money must be spent on food
In the end, we can not pay it back
(Interview, female, 57, Kabupaten Ngawi, 26 April 2010) The need for this kind of capital assistance emerges because of their fear of being unable to pay it back
This fear, or lack of courage, to take this kind of risk is natural, not only in Indonesia, but also in Southeast Asia in general, as shown by James C
Scott in his classic book The Moral Economy of Peasant (1977)
The results of an FGD stated, Because of lack of capital and fear of applying for a credit
I don't have the courage to apply for a loan for fear of losses (Middle-class Women's FGD, 26, Kabupaten Bombana, 6 June 2010)
Generally, the poor community wants capital because they want to open a business
However, not all poor people know what kind of business they will open once they get the capital
Most of them see business as something similar to what they see in their surroundings, something that is different from their work as a farmer, namely petty trading
Most of the people in the sample villages, such as the people in Lalembo, Tambusupa, and Tempursari, who had become SPP borrowers used their loan to open a kiosk/stall selling daily needs, a stall near school selling snacks for children, or an itinerant trading business
There were not many SPP borrowers, especially the poor ones, who used their funds to meet agricultural capital needs
This happened, among others, because they were not sure if investing in the agricultural sector would give more results than usual so that they could pay the SPP funds back
Besides, the repayment mechanism of the SPP loan in all villages that is once a month is burdensome to farmers
Agricultural enterprises are not monthly in nature, but seasonal
How can they pay every month if their yield is seasonal
Therefore, several village people suggested that the loan scheme be made seasonal, instead of monthly
The understanding of SPP-PNPM loan as mentioned above, on the one side, encourages job diversification in the rural area
However, on the other hand, this is counterproductive with the traits of PNPM-Rural that is supposed to encourage agriculture-based enterprises
In relation with alternative job opportunities, what was meant by the informants was jobs other that agricultural jobs that have been undertaken by the poor people all this time
The emergence of needs for alternative jobs is driven by the disappointment of working in the agricultural sector all their life but it has never brought them welfare
Moreover, many of those who are involved in agricultural works are only farm hands with income that is far from enough, so aspiration to have a more decent job is increasing
Some other village people who do not have any other options but the agriculture sector need stable prices of agricultural produce
According to them, the prices of agricultural produce have never sided with the farmers
When the harvest season comes, the prices of almost all agricultural produce plummet and the government does nothing to help the farmers
When in fact, they become heavily burdened day by day with the rising expenses of seeds, fertilizer, and processing
The types of alternative jobs that were revealed by the informants tended to refer to steady jobs that gave regular fixed income
What they imagined was a job in a factory or in a plantation
Aside from that, they also considered side jobs (not permanent) that could give extra income to their main job as a farmer, such as stock breeding or trading
The next primary need is skills training
This need is apparently related to the high degree of community's aspiration to alternative jobs
Alternative side jobs such as breeding livestock, selling homemade products, and others are things that are probably not familiar to them, so they need certain skills training
The kinds of training that were mostly mentioned by FGD participants were, among others, sewing, baking, beauty and cosmetology, handicraft, agriculture (for special plants), and animal husbandry skills
These top three primary needs actually show a quite solid course of ideas about the desire to leave the current working condition that is not favorable
To start a new job, what they really need are financial capital and knowledge and skills capital
Besides these three needs, two other needs with a high frequency of emergence are the needs for good and free education and health services
The high aspiration for both of these needs arises because the jargon frequently used by the government regarding free education and health services has not been felt by the poor community in reality
In relation with basic education, the village people still have to bear quite an amount of money for educational support needs, such as uniforms, books, transportation costs, and pocket money
For higher education levels, it is clear that all needs must be borne by each individual
Some village people realize that it is impossible for the government to fulfill all their needs related to education
Such needs as pocket money must surely be the responsibility of the parents
However, there are actually costs that the people do not have to pay if the government improves the educational system
For example, in almost every region, whenever it is near the (national) final exam, there are additional learning activities from teachers to help students to prepare for the exam
For that, parents must spend money which is usually quite considerable
If the learning-teaching process ran effectively and efficiently, this kind of activity would not be needed and parents would not have to spend more money
Related to the health aspect, not all villagers have received Jamkesmas and Regional Health Insurance for the Poor (Jamkesda) cards
Apart from that, especially for Jamkesmas/Jamkesda cardholders, the service that they receive is occasionally unsatisfactory
For example, they are treated as second-class patients, who are served after patients who pay for the service; given medicine which, according to the people, is not of good quality; and even rejected for treatment at the hospital
Besides these five common needs, there are other needs that only few villages mentioned, such as the needs for sembako (nine staple foods) assistance, irrigation, roads, agricultural counseling, agricultural tools assistance, and seed assistance
Aside from these relatively common needs in each village, there are also needs that are specific to and contextual in certain villages
At least, there are three villages that have specific needs
The specific need of Desa Labungga, Konawe Utara, is to have electricity during day time
This need arises because in this village, electricity is only available for six hours at night
Outside this period of time, if they need electricity, they have to use a genset (electricity generator) and only the rich people in the village have it
The people of Desa Tambusupa, Konawe Selatan, specifically need water pumps to flow water to their rice fields
They need the water pumps because most of the rice fields are rain-fed rice fields
Although the village is passed by two major rivers, during the dry season, the river water is used up by the village located at a higher ground, namely Desa Margacinta
Therefore, the alternative solution to flow the rice fields with water is by pumping water from the wells that are plenty in their rice fields
The people of Desa Kramat in Kabupaten Gresik need a local government policy to prohibit fishers from using trawl nets
The use of trawl nets is unfavorable for traditional fishers because the trawl users can catch all fish and the traditional fishers with regular fish nets cannot catch any fish
They need the policy because the Local Government of Kabupaten Lamongan, their neighboring kabupaten, has forbidden the use of trawl in their area, making the trawl users move their operations to the waters around Desa Kramat
6.2 Fulfillment of Primary Needs
The needs discussed above in general have never been formulated together at the village/nagari level
Before the PNPM-Rural (or PPK for areas that received it) existed, the formulation of village/nagari needs was usually conducted in a technocratic way, i.e., limitedly formulated by the elite circle consisting of village officials, BPD, and several community figures
The formulation of needs was usually conducted in the musrenbangdes/nagari
However, in several regions, such as the nagari in Sumatra Barat, there have been efforts to create a synergy between the need formulation model in musrenbang and the participatory need formulation model as implemented by PNPM
The fulfillment of various village needs discussed above has generally been or is being conducted
Several villages had accepted capital funds, for instance, through the SPP-PNPM, UEP-SP, Gardu Taskin, Female Cooperative (Kopwan) in East Java, Baitul Maal wa Tamwil (BMT, or Islamic microfinance institution) in West Sumatra, Cooperative Work Group (KUBE) and Bantesa (capital loan from the Sintesa NGO) in Southeast Sulawesi, etc
The need fulfillment of alternative job opportunities have only been conducted through labor-intensive programs that are usually only available for a limited time, just like in PNPM projects
Aside from that, residents acknowledged that there were no programs or assistance that aimed at making the people able to access alternative jobs
Besides that, the need for skills training is the least fulfilled need
In the research locations, there was only one jorong, namely Jorong Piruko in Kabupaten Dharmasraya, where its people received skills training, i.e., baking skills training
Other basic needs, such as education and health, have generally been fulfilled in all villages
However, the people have not felt satisfied because there are still many burdens that they have to bear in order for the needs to be completely fulfilled
Some of the specific needs of each village had also been fulfilled, while others had not
The need for water pumps in Tambusupa, for example, had been met through government assistance
However, according to the people, the water pumps are mostly controlled by the village elite, so the general community have not felt the benefits
The need of Desa Kramat, Gresik, for a policy that forbids the use of trawl net has been discussed with the Local Government of Gresik and the government has promised to act on it
However, until now, the people still find the use of trawl net in their sea
Besides that, the specific need that has not been fulfilled is the electricity need during the day in Labungga
The people of Labungga had already submitted the request to the authority, which is PLN in this case
However, due to limited electrical power supply, up to now, they can only enjoy six hours of electricity every night
As described above, there are many parties involved in the fulfillment of village primary needs
According to most villagers, the fulfillment of village primary needs is firstly the responsibility of the government, followed by the individuals, and lastly community groups
Some villagers considered that the fulfillment of individual needs, such as jobs, basic needs, etc., is the responsibility of the individuals, then the government, and finally third parties (community, NGOs, the rich people, etc.)
6.2.1 Role of the Government 
The government's role is hugely accounted for in fulfilling the people's needs
In general, there are two models of government role, through routine budgets and through programs
The first model is carried out by providing ADD with 30% of it for village operational activities and 70% for community empowerment
However, in the study locations, there were only few programs making use of ADD budget to fulfill the above village primary needs
In fact, in many villages, the people questioned the use of ADD because the amount received and the allocation of the budget had never been announced
In the second model, the government provides programs, both programs with specific recipients, such as BLT, PKH (Family of Hope Program), Raskin, and Jamkesmas, and general programs, such as PNPM, BOS, JPD, and other implemented programs
The village primary needs are apparently fulfilled more through this second mechanism
In the last eight or three years, all villages in the study areas have received plenty of programs (for more detailed information about programs received by the community, see Appendix 3)
6.2.2 Role of the Community 
Community role refers to the efforts that have been made individually or collectively, but are not organized through certain institutions, to help fulfill village needs
The individual role of the people is very much related to their capacity, especially in terms of economy
According to the informants, the rich people in the village have a big role in giving assistance, both in the form of charity, such as donations, and giving help in a professional context, such as providing jobs for the poor
Some of them also provide fund assistance, but just like what happens in Ngawi, they apply a very high interest rate
Instead of helping people who need capital, they apply loan shark practices
The collective role of the people is by working together, commonly known as gotong royong or mutual assistance, to do something in the interest of the village or certain people in the village
In Desa Kramat, for instance, recently the people worked together to build a house for the member of their community whose house was burnt down by fire
Both individual and collective roles of the people are usually unplanned and sporadic in nature
Related to various primary needs elaborated above, the community's role is only in the fulfillment of the needs of alternative jobs and capital
6.2.3 Role of Social Groups
There are many and diverse social groups in the study villages
Some groups are very specific, while others can be found in almost all villages (for more detailed information on social groups in every village, see Appendix 4)
There are three groups that are very common or can be found in all villages
Quran recitation group, farmers' group, and PKK
Besides that, there are also groups that become the vehicle for certain assistance recipients' groups, such as SPP female groups, Bantesa, etc
More specific groups are usually associated with the local culture
For example, in West Sumatra, there are clans (or buhua arek) that act as a means for villagers that come from the same clan to meet
Other than that, there is Bundo Kanduang, an instrument of nagari government structure that consists of female leaders
In Southeast Sulawesi, there are mepotaka groups, which are similar to arisan groups that consist of only male members
There are arisan groups for various community groups in East Java, including those that are connected by a relationship of blood (trah, Javanese)
Generally, the informants put the Quran recitation group as the most important group to them
This is perhaps the reflection of a religious community
However, if it is associated with the village primary needs, the most important social group is the farmers' group because only the farmers' group that facilitates them to be able to get various agricultural needs, such as fertilizer, seed, and poison
However, the farmers' groups in several villages exist only to fulfill the requirement to obtain the above-mentioned assistance
In fact, these groups have no day-to-day activities
In addition, the informants stated that they were extremely helped by becoming a member of the arisan group because in this group, members can borrow some money when they are in dire need, besides benefitting from the group's revolving savings
In certain regions, there are also religious groups that not only conduct religious activities, but also give economic support to their members
There is a Quran recitation group in Tempursari that includes arisan and savings and loan in their activities
According to FGD participants, the fund that can be borrowed by the members of the group is quite big, as much as Rp5 millions
However, unfortunately, this group has stopped lending capital for the last two years
Groups that are formed as the vehicle for borrowers of a program usually only function to consolidate borrowers in order that they can receive information easily, especially regarding the payment of instalment
This study does not find SPP borrowers' groups that conduct productive activities together
The group is actually designed for members to bear responsibility collectively in the case that a member cannot pay the installment, but the study did not find this in the study villages
In case of arrears, it is the village government that will pay for it, as happened in Kramat, Gresik, and a village in Kecamatan Moramo, Konawe Selatan
The village officials are willing to pay for it because they understand that if the SPP repayment in their village is in arrears, the village will not receive the physical programs
6.2.4 Role of PNPM 
In fulfilling the primary needs of the village, PNPM's role is very limited
As described at the beginning of this report, most of PNPM projects in the study areas are related to infrastructure development, while according to the people, the primary needs of villages are not infrastructure, but capital, alternative jobs, skills training, and education scholarship and quality health service
All the village primary needs are not directly in contact at all with PNPM activities in every village
Indirectly, PNPM infrastructure program did create job opportunities for some poor community, even though only with limited workdays and payment
The SPP program had also given several people access to capital
However, the poor people have not become the main target in these infrastructure and SPP programs
This is due to the fact that in the infrastructure program, the workers were not specifically recruited from the poor community in the study areas and, in most regions, their payment was deducted due to self-help reason
Other than that, in the SPP program, most of the recipients were not the poor people because the program executors were afraid that if the SPP funds had been given to the poor, they would not have been able to return the money
The tendency to allocate PNPM projects to fulfill infrastructure needs happens everywhere
There are no discrepancies found between villages that have received the program for a long time and villages that are new to the program, or between advanced and poor villages
It means that the community in villages that have already received PNPM-Rural (PPK) since 2002 or have better welfare level has the same aspiration as that of the community that has just received the program in 2009 or has a worse welfare level
In fact, it is only logical if the villages that have already received the program since 2002, or the K1 villages, are able to divert their development focus from infrastructure after several years of receiving this program
Moreover, the K1 category villages in this study are mostly villages with a high level of welfare
Main infrastructure availability in these villages with a high level of welfare is usually quite sufficient
What then encourages villages that have received PNPM for a long time and/or have a high level of welfare to keep allocating PNPM funds to the infrastructure sector
In general, the tendency towards infrastructure and the similarity between old and new regions receiving PNPM funds can be explained by several things related to the objective condition of study villages as described next
a) Minimal village infrastructure Based on field observation, especially in poor villages outside Java, the main infrastructure (roads and irrigation) before there was PNPM-Rural was still limited
In fact, in several villages in Kabupaten Bombana and Konawe Utara in Southeast Sulawesi, there are still main roads or inter-dusun roads that are still not yet asphalted or are heavily damaged
The same thing happens to irrigation ducts
Most of the irrigation networks are still the primary ones, and are rarely the secondary, or even the tertiary, ones
When PNPM arrived, the community could easily achieve an agreement over its allocation to infrastructure development
A respondent in Kabupaten Bombana, Southeast Sulawesi, pointedly stated, It fits perfectly
Do not terminate PNPM please
Every development activity carried out in this village, we owe it all to PNPM (Middle-class Women's FGD, 26, Kabupaten Bombana, 6 June 2010)
b) PNPM is considered as a program for the general community The community feels that PNPM-Rural is intended for the villagers in general without looking at their welfare status
To them, this program is different from such programs as BLT, PKH, and Raskin, that are specifically designed for poor people
From the 72 FGDs conducted with the poor and middle/rich communities, most of the participants stated that the target of this program was the village community in general
Only a few of them thought that the program was intended for unemployed labors or sellers with no capital
Because this program is meant for all villagers, it must be allocated for something that can be beneficial for all members of the community and that is the main infrastructure of the village
In fact, in several study villages, the PNPM infrastructure project did not hire workers that were specifically recruited from the poor, but any willing villagers
But, since the amount of wage given was the same for every worker and was usually according to or under the standard wage of labors in the local villages, there were almost no poor people who were willing to participate
Some of the following quotations illustrate the community's opinions
For PNPM program, it is already right on target
All community members enjoy it, not only the poor people
(Poor Men's FGD, 50, Kabupaten Agam, 13 May 2010) The whole community, but they should ask whether the people want to borrow the fund [SPP] or not
(Middle-class Women's FGD, 50, Kabupaten Bombana, 6 June 2010) All members of the community
(Middle-class Men's FGD, 30, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, 5 June 2010) In PNPM, there is Jalan Usaha Tani (farm roads), so everyone will take benefit from it
(Poor Men's FGD, 40, Kabupaten Konawe Utara, 4 June 2010) The most effective is PNPM because in a broader sense, it can be felt by the community, the poor get jobs and payment even though only incidental, and the community in general enjoys the improvement of the road
(Interview, male, 40, village head, Kabupaten Gresik, 22 April 2010) In my opinion, in terms of regulation, PNPM is the best
PNPM is a direct program
From the beginning, its purpose is to cover all the community
Other programs are only limited to certain groups
(Interview, male, 45, village head, Kabupaten Lumajang, 22 April 2010) c) To avoid conflicts caused by segmented programs (such as BLT, Raskin, etc.) Before PNPM became a mass program, the community had received programs in which the recipients were segmented, especially to the poor, such as BLT, Askeskin (now Jamkesmas), and Raskin
In most of the study areas, these programs had generated problems, such as jealousy or even conflict between community groups
These problems occurred mostly due to the household targeting mechanism that was considered dissatisfactory, where people that should have been given the right to assistance did not receive it, and vice versa
When PNPM was launched and inexplicitly targeted the poor group (community targeting), the village community was inclined to guide it towards something that can be enjoyed by all community in order to avoid protests from those who did not receive it
The following citations illustrate this tendency
In my village, from the time PNPM was launched in Kecamatan Tempursari, we decided in every village consultation meeting that it must be used for infrastructure development, roads, and bridges
(Interview, male, 45, village head, Kabupaten Lumajang, 22 April 2010) For data census, it is better if the RT does it
There was once someone from the kecamatan that did the census, but it wasn't relevant
The data was not completely compiled
Many people protested
The enumerator ran way
The RT was skipped
(Middle-class Men's FGD, 35, Kabupaten Gresik, 24 April 2010) Sometimes the census was conducted based on kinship
(Middle-class Men's FGD, 30, Kabupaten Gresik, 24 April 2010) There was once a conflict in the village hall due to social jealousy in the disproportion of PKH reception
At that time, one of the citizens threw a chair above which broke that ceiling [pointing the ceiling]
(Poor Men's FGD, 37, Kabupaten Gresik, 23 April 2010) d) Bias of the elite and nonpoor villagers The role of the elite is very significant in determining program types in the village
This can be seen from the proposed program types and FGD result about who has the most influence in decision-making process in the village
However, not all of the significant role of the elite can be categorized as elite capture because in several regions, the participation of the elite is direly needed to silence the conflict resulted by the acutely different aspirations concerning development project proposal
The elite mainly consists of officials at the village, dusun, and even RT levels, and community leaders
In the study areas, their significant role can be found in several stages of the program, which are in (1) the selection process of facilitators
In one of the provinces, there is information from a kecamatan facilitator that most of the kecamatan facilitators in that province came from the same region as the head of provincial satker (work unit); (2) socialization activities
In all regions, those that were invited to receive the early socialization of the program were the village elites, such as the village officials cum BPD and community leaders, who were all appointed by the village head; (3) the proposal selection process at the village/nagari level
In several nagari in West Sumatra, nine people from the village elite have a huge role in deciding which program will be taken to the inter-nagari consultative meeting (MAN); and (4) the proposal selection process at the kecamatan level
In several kecamatan in all provinces, there is an indication that the MAD/MAN is just a formality; the lobby between village heads highly determines the project that will be approved
The bias of the nonpoor group can be observed from the selection of proposed projects
The infrastructure projects, such as road, irrigation, and TK/PAUD building projects, are utilized and enjoyed more by the nonpoor group
In the proposal formulation process in the Musdus (dusun consultative meeting) or Musdes, in most regions, most of the people attending it were the middle up to the rich groups
Poor workers were also not favored in the implementation of the project
more than often their pay was deducted from the given standard due to self-help reason
For the moment, the existing program is inclined to be an infrastructure one, right
So, the nonphysical programs are abandoned, or lacking
For poor community, the good program is fund aid program from UEP-SP
That is for poor people
As for the middle-rich, they pay attention to physical sector
(Interview, male, 45, village head, Kabupaten Lumajang, 22 April 2010) Road is only for those who can trade
We can't do that
So, the only good thing is that the road is no longer wet
(Poor Women's FGD, 39, Kabupaten Lumajang, 24 April 2010)
6.3 PNPM Empowerment That Is Not Fully Effective 
PNPM, among others, aims to liberate the community from poverty
However, the fact that there is only a little difference in welfare between villages having received PNPM since 2002 and those having just received the program in 2007 or 2009 shows that PNPM empowerment is not fully effective
The failure of PNPM to empower these villages have caused them to be unable to fulfill their primary needs and has had little impact on the management of the village administrations as well as programs other than PNPM
Besides the various problems previously discussed in the preceding chapters, there are another two problems that are considered to have caused the ineffective PNPM empowerment, both being conceptual and technical in nature
6.3.1 Empowerment as a Very Mechanistic Concept
In general, PNPM conceptualisation of empowerment is as the effort to create/enhance community capacity, both individually and collectively, in solving various problems related to efforts to improve quality of life, independence, and welfare (General Guidelines for PNPM Mandiri, p 20)
Technically, the understanding of empowerment as the effort to enhance community capacity is then embodied into a series of community development activities that are believed to be able to create a prosperous and independent community
These activities are Community development components [that] cover a series of activities to build critical awareness and independence of the community that consist of the mapping of potentials, community problems and needs, participatory planning, organizing, resource utilization, monitoring, and maintenance of achieved results
(General Guidelines for PNPM Mandiri, p 29)
The series of activities above is then formulated in PNPM implementation stages as described in Chapter II above
Hence, technically, what is meant as empowerment by PNPM is conducting a series of activities in PNPM implementation stages
The assumption is clear; by carefully implementing the program stages, the output of the empowerment process will certainly be created, i.e., a prosperous and independent community
Clearly, PNPM empowerment concept displays a mechanistic view of change, that is, the community will change according to the given stimulus
PNPM expects the community to be participative, transparent, and accountable
For that, they will get an amount of fund that can be used in the development of their village
In the context of a homogeneous society and that there is no interest group threatened by changes, this kind of program might work
However, in a more complex situation where many actors are involved and have interest in these various changes, programs that attempt to change the foundation of life embraced by the majority of the community, such as PNPM, will encounter many challenges
What is not adequately anticipated by the program is the very complex social reality in the village
The low level of participation, transparency, and accountability; the poor quality of village governance; the difficulty of welfare improvement; and the low level of villagers' independence are not simple problems that can be solved in a year or two by a program such as PNPM
There are still many aspects of social relationships that remain untouchable by PNPM, such as the dominance of village elites, the strong patron-client relationship, the established familial relationship, and the lack of the poor's courage and confidence
These relationships have been created in the living process of the community for hundreds of years and have become the foundation of established social interactions
Poor farmers can survive because of, among others, the moral support, and social and fund assistances from the elite, which then becomes their patron
In many cases, they also depend on their family and relatives
Conversely, the elite receives something in return from the poor in the form of legitimacy, trust, and absolute obedience
This kind of relationship is stable because both give and take
This relationship model becomes the pattern that defines the roles and responsibilities of each party and various social institutions are created later on to strengthen and eternalize it
In East Java, for example, there is abot sawangane that socially, culturally, and economically becomes the patron of the general community, especially the poor
In West Sumatra, the role of ninik mamak (tribe chief), even though already having shifted, cannot be suppressed by the change of era
In Southeast Sulawesi, the elders and the rich in the village are the ones that decide on every matter related to public interests
The arrival of PNPM basically shakes and even demolishes the stability of these social relationships
PNPM's idea about liberal participation that encourages individual to be directly responsible for all decisions in the village related to their own interests, on the one side, means the elimination of the elite's dominance
However, on the other hand, this idea also gives more responsibility to the poor because due to the loss of domination of the elite, the incentive from them as the patron of the poor is also eliminated
When the poor are in desperate condition, both economically and socially, the elite has no more obligations to help
Various quotations in the participation part in Chapter III suggest this fear of the poor
Furthermore, PNPM's idea about transparency and accountability will also mean the loss of privilege of certain groups to the village's resources
By all accounts, the lack of transparency in the decision-making in the village is, to a certain degree, beneficial to certain parties, be it the village officials or people who receive benefits from it
The notion of accountability, especially related to village finance, is even riskier
Demanding transparency and accountability not only deals with government administration and management aspects, but also moral aspects
Demanding transparency and accountability means accusing concerned parties to have been hiding and even swindling certain resources and that is a morally serious accusation in the rural area
This will also bring a very serious implication because, no matter what, the elite's legitimacy in the rural area is mostly built upon moral aspect, rather than formal aspect (legislation)
Based on the above explanation, it is clear that implementation of participatory programs like (but not only) PNPM can create negative consequences to social relationship stability, even though it will not cause chaos
Therefore, resistance will come from both the elite and the poor, because PNPM's ideas endanger not only the position of the elite but also the poor
As described by James C Scott (1985), resistance occur not only in offensive actions but also in defensive actions by way of silence
Silent resistance has been observed in the field, namely the low level of poor people's participation in various activities other than PNPM
The fact that the poor are relatively participative in PNPM is because the program requires them to be so and their participation is mobilized by the elite and is not entirely on their own accord
6.3.2 In Contradiction with Local Specialties
Another issue that is considered related to the ineffectiveness of PNPM empowerment is that because, to a certain degree, the concept of PNPM empowerment is not suitable for or even against the local features
The most apparent evidence regarding this is the difference between the participation concept of PNPM and that in the Minangkabau custom in West Sumatra
Like mentioned above, PNPM encourages the creation of liberal participation, in which every individual has to represent himself/herself in any activity that is related to his/her personal interest
A representation system will only strengthen the dominance of the elite
Conversely, West Sumatra, which since the start of the reform era has enthusiastically revitalized their old customs, possesses a different participation concept
With the spirit of going back to the nagari (concept), they have developed a participation pattern that can be described as communitarian participation
In this communitarian participation, the community, and not the individual, is thrust forward
In practice, in various decision-making processes related to public interest, the ones involved are the communities or tribes where individuals become the members
In this model, the tribe chief automatically becomes the personification of the tribe
This is different from the representation concept in which the representative is just a person who is appointed to represent the interest of individuals through an election process
According to a wali nagari in Kabupaten Agam, the revitalization of the communitarian concept is part of their effort to bring back the traditional values existing in the old nagari governance that they consider ideal
In the nagari in West Sumatra, this communitarian concept is institutionalized into the decision-making process in nagari
For example, in Nagari Batu Palano, Kabupaten Agam, the formulation of nagari regulations involves all tribes which consist of 58 tribes
The implementation technique is as follow
First, the nagari government designs a nagari regulation together with the Nagari House of Representatives (BPRN)
The temporary draft is then distributed to each tribe through its tribe chief
The draft regulation is then deliberated by each tribe, the result of which is to state their agreement/disagreement over the design
After all tribes concur, the regulation is then taken to the nagari plenary meeting which is attended by nagari officials, BPRN, and the representatives of all tribes in the nagari
The coming of PNPM that brings along the liberal participation concept to a certain level challenges the communitarian concept that is in the process of being established in West Sumatra
Even though the two are against one another, both can still run on their own
Liberal-individual participation takes place during the PNPM activities, while communitarian participation goes on outside PNPM
However, if PNPM continues to encourage liberal participation and is hoping the mechanism to be adopted as a public practice for all decision making processes, this may lead to a collision
The incompatibility between participation concept that is promoted by PNPM and participation concept that is being established in this region explains why the PNPM version of individual participation cannot infect other decision-making processes in the nagari
6.3.3 Facilitators and Facilitating Problems
The facilitator is the spearhead of PNPM empowerment
It is the facilitator who ensures that the stages in the program that are the instruments in the empowerment are properly applied in the field
However, as depicted in Chapter II, there is a difference in the capacity of facilitators from different regions which affect the success of program implementation
There are quite a number of facilitators that have no experience and some of them are even fresh graduates
In fact, facilitating which is mostly related to the efforts to invite, persuade, and motivate requires special skills that mostly develop from one's long experience
In addition, there is also an issue that in a certain province, some facilitators are originally from the same kabupaten as the satker officer
This means a high nepotism level in the facilitator recruitment
In such a situation, it is understandable if the quality of the facilitators is neglected
In the sample areas, facilitators' activities are mostly occupied by technical and administrative matters, that is, facilitating various community meetings as well as making numerous reports about the implementation of PNPM in the field
The more villages they have under their responsibility, the more time is used up for technical and administrative matters
There has not been any case where a facilitator does extra work to strengthen the existing social organizations or to assist SPP recipient groups
As mentioned in Chapter II, these facilitators admit that they run out of time to finish various technical and administrative matters of the program
Besides the problem of quality and the heavy load of technical/administrative work, there is another problem, that is, the frequent rotation of facilitator from one region to another
On the one hand, this rotation policy probably has some advantages, for example, to anticipate community's dependence on the facilitator and to give new atmosphere and experience to the facilitator
However, on the other hand, this policy becomes a problem because facilitation efficacy is also affected by how deep a facilitator understands the area where he works
In fact, there is a kecamatan in the study area that does not have any facilitator at all because its facilitator has been transferred to another kecamatan and there has not been a replacement yet
VII CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.1 Conclusions
a) In general, the PNPM-Rural has been implemented quite well, except in the followings
(1) Socialization activities were not effectively undertaken resulting in various understandings over PNPM
For example, PNPM was considered as a general program, not as a poverty reduction program, so the poor did not have to be prioritized
(2) The competition to win a PNPM project at the kecamatan level tends to result in deviation
In many villages, the competition was manouvered resulting in the decision to split the projects evenly
(3) The facilitators had different understandings about the program causing diversity in program implementation
(4) Many facilitators considered that their workload was too excessive due to the large number of villages/jorong that became their responsibility
b) Some aspects in program implementation in the field were very much in contrast to the spirit of poverty reduction
These aspects are as follows
(1) not specifically determining that the workers in the PNPM infrastructure project had to come from the poor community
(2) deducting the workers' wage in the PNPM infrastructure project due to self-reliance reasons or others
(3) limiting the poor people's access to obtaining SPP loan by applying requirements that they could never meet
(4) making SPP realization in the village as a prerequisite to get an open menu program
and (5) making the realization of 25% cost sharing funds from the kabupaten as a provision to attain the program fund from the central government
c) PNPM-Rural was considered beneficial by the community, especially in providing infrastructure in rural areas
Almost all of PNPM-Rural open menu programs were in the form of infrastructure projects
There were only few projects in the form of activities such as skills training for the community
d) As a mechanism for the distribution of development fund from the central government to the village, this program is very effective and efficient
In study areas, there was almost no deviation found in the use of PNPM budget
However, as a community empowerment instrument or as a poverty reduction program, the program has not been able to accomplish many things due to the following reasons
(1) The program's design does not fully support empowerment
(2) The human resources (facilitators) for empowerment are lacking
(3) There are many disparities in program implementation
(4) There are sociocultural obstacles, such as
(a) the dominance of village elite's role
(b) the strong familial system or relationship
and (c) the presence of patronage relationship between the village elite and the poor
e) There is a decrease in poverty level in almost all of study villages, except in two villages
However, the role of PNPM-Rural in decreasing poverty in the sample villages was not considered significant by the people
PNPM-Rural is considered to participate more indirectly in poverty reduction by repairing community's access to various public services
f) The creation of job opportunities in PNPM-Rural infrastructure projects is not enough to help the poor
The reason, apart from the very limited days and the fact the workers were not obligated to come from the poor community, is the deduction of wage that was regarded as the form of community participation in the program
SPP is believed to be highly beneficial to expand community's business, but the poor had difficulties in accessing it since the program implementers required the presence of productive business ownership
Almost all poor people do not have it
In addition, the community was also afraid to utilize SPP because their economic capacity could not give them a guarantee that they could return the loan within the determined schedule
g) The participation of the community, both males and females, in the PNPM-Rural stages tends to increase
However, the participation was seemingly performed only to fulfill program's requirements
In various decision-making forums in the village, or in programs other than PNPM that did not require people's participation, the village elites were still very dominant, whereas the community, especially the poor, was almost not involved
h) Numerous PNPM-Rural projects were not suitable with the needs of the village's poor people
PNPM-Rural projects were dominantly in the form of infrastructure projects, while the three main needs of the poor people in the village are skills training, alternative job opportunities, and capital assistance
PNPM actually had the opportunity to fulfill these needs through the open menu program and SPP
However, in reality, it did not happen because
(1) the open menu programs were almost always physical and there were almost no skills training activities
(2) in the infrastructure projects, the workers did not always come from the poor community and there was wage deduction as a form of self-reliance
and (3) SPP could not be accessed by the poor because there are burdensome requirements or because the poor themselves are afraid of applying for the loan
7.2 Recommendations 
a) It is necessary to consider avoiding uniformity of design and/or program implementation for all regions
There are inharmonious indications between the program's general character that puts forward individual participation (direct participation) and local cultural pattern that leans towards communitarian trait (representative participation)
b) It is necessary to expand and intensify the socialization of the program and its mechanism in general and, specifically, open menu option, SPP requirements and mechanism, and the position of poor people as the target group in the program
For that, it is essential to maximize the facilitators' role in facilitation activities at every stage of the PNPM implementation, especially during the formulation of needs and program implementation
In order to achieve this, more facilitators are needed
c) It is necessary to encourage the integration of development planning through PNPM with development planning through musrenbangdes
From various practices in the field, the best model is implementing both in one deliberation to formulate village needs
This integration will encourage musrenbangdes to be more participative, aspirational, and open
d) It is highly necessary to re-formulate the mechanism for and amount of SPP funds return that can ease the burden of the poor people, and it is necessary to have more systematic and intensive efforts to make the people realize the benefits of SPP as well as to eliminate their fear of applying for the loan
e) It is extremely necessary to formulate a mechanism/institution that is credible and forceful to ensure that program regulations are implemented according to plan
f) It is necessary to review the proportionality of the number of facilitators to their workload, reduce the technical administrative workload of facilitators, and increase their social empowerment work portion through their intensive involvement in various group activities in the village
g) It is necessary to consider program design improvement so that it can touch agricultural issue more profoundly
h) It is necessary to conduct continuous assessment and development to find various community empowerment models that are suitable for all communities with diverse social conditions
In particular, it is also necessary to develop an empowerment instrument for the chronic poor by treating them as an inseparable part of their community

ABSTRACT
The Effectiveness of the Raskin Program
The Raskin program is a subsidized rice program for poor families which provides 10 kg of rice per poor households at the price of Rp1,000 per kg
This report describes the findings of the study undertaken by the SMERU Research Institute to uncover the effectiveness of the Raskin program in achieving its objectives as well as to obtain lessons learned to improve the program
This qualitative study uses three different approaches to data collection
document review and secondary data analysis or meta- evaluation; interviews of key informants at the central level; and field study
The findings suggests that, in general, the Raskin program indicates relatively low effectiveness, that many problems emerge in the distribution of the rice from the primary distribution point to the beneficiaries, and that the issues faced are actually similar each year
The low effectiveness of the program is indicated by the lack of program socialization and transparency; inaccurate targeting, amount, and frequency of rice received by beneficiaries, as well as price of rice; high cost of program management, ineffective monitoring and evaluation; and ineffective complaint mechanism
Keywords
Raskin, program evaluation, poverty reduction program
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Raskin program is a national program aimed at helping poor households to fulfill their food needs and reducing their financial burden by providing subsidized rice
The program is a continuation of the Special Market Operation (OPK) program launched in July 1998
In 2007, Raskin plans to provide 1.9 tonnes of rice for 15.8 million poor households with the total cost of Rp6.28 trillion
Each targeted household should receive 10 kg of rice each month with the price of Rp1,000 per kilogram at the distribution point
The State Logistics Agency (Bulog) is responsible for the distribution of rice to the distribution points, while the local government is responsible for distributing the rice to poor households from the distribution points
The Raskin program has been modified several times, but the program's effectiveness is still debatable
In light of this, the National Development Planning Board (Bappenas) asked The SMERU Research Institute to study the effectiveness of the Raskin program and to draw lessons that can be used to improve the program
The study used the meta-evaluation method (document review and secondary data analysis) supported by interviews with key informants at the central level and field research
The following describes the main findings of the study
In terms of rice distribution up to distribution points, Bulog has conducted its task relatively well as mandated by the program guidance
Nevertheless, the program's success cannot be assessed solely based on this fact because Raskin is a program to distribute subsidized rice to poor households
The problems with Raskin's implementation often occurred from distribution points up to household beneficiaries
According to the Raskin General Guidelines, Raskin's success can be measured based on the level of achieving the 6T indicators
correct target, correct amount, correct price, correct time, correct quality, and correct administration
In general, the results of the study on Raskin program's implementation show that the program's effectiveness is still relatively low
This is shown in the program's lack of socialization and transparency; inaccurate targeting, prices, amounts, and distribution frequencies; high management cost; below optimal monitoring; and poorly functioning complaints system
A. Socialization and Information Transparency
Program socialization is one of the keys to a successful program, but Raskin's General Guidelines do not regulate socialization activities in detail
This has led to the varied socialization activities aimed at local officials in the regions and the program's weak socialization to the community
1. The document review concludes that the Raskin program was socialized to implementers at various levels of government using a structural-bureaucratic approach
There were no specific meetings to socialize the program; rather it was discussed in general meetings
This is in line with field findings that the socialization was conducted in stages based on the level of government and usually at the same time with monitoring and evaluation activities
Socialization at the provincial level was conducted twice a year
At the district/city level, socialization activities varied depending on each regional government
2. It can be concluded from the document review and field visits that one of the program's weak points is the informal method of socializing the Raskin program to the community via village/kelurahan officials and local people distributing the rice to the beneficiaries
Generally, the community and Raskin beneficiaries have not received comprehensive program information
In fact, many were not aware of general information about the program, such as what the program name means, how much rice beneficiaries are entitled to receive, what the government-stipulated price of the rice is, and how often or how many times a year they should receive the rice
Nevertheless, the community was widely aware of the essence of the program that Raskin is rice assistance from the government for poor communities
3. Limited socialization influences the program's transparency to the community and has the potential to cause corruption, inaccurate targeting, and the inaccurate perception held by regional governments that Raskin is a central government program which negatively influenced their commitment to supporting the program's implementation
4. The results of both the document review and field visits show that the program is still relatively opaque
This can be concluded by the poor availability of general information on the program, lists of beneficiaries, and pricing
SMERU did not come across any information about the Raskin program posted in public places in any of the sample regions
Only in Kabupaten Agam, West Sumatra, where the community had access to information on beneficiaries
B. Beneficiaries, Targeting, and the Amount and Price of Rice 
In general, there are still problems with the distribution of Raskin, such as under-coverage (the maximum number of poor household (RTM) beneficiaries is below the total number of RTM), inaccurate targeting, shortfalls in both the amount of rice that the majority of beneficiaries received and how often they received it, and inconsistencies in the price that beneficiaries paid
1. Until 2005, the Raskin program targeted households falling into the preprosperous (KPS) and prosperous I (KS-1) economic classifications based on data from the National Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN)
Since 2006, the program has targeted households categorized as poor households (RTM) according to the results of the BPS PSE-05 (2005 Household Socioeconomic Survey) data
As RTM are spread across all administrative levels of all regions, the Raskin program operates in all regions, without differentiating between regional poverty conditions
Nevertheless, the document review reveals several cases where subdistricts (kecamatan) or villages/kelurahan did not receive Raskin for a certain period due to outstanding payments, implementational deviation, or a request from the subdistrict
2. The Raskin program's targeted number of RTM is increasing by year
But is still lower than the total number of RTM
For instance, the program targeted 19.1 million RTM in 2007, but the central government only agreed to 15.8 million RTM
Consequently, 3.3 million RTM did not receive a Raskin rice quota
Based on the document review and field visits, the allocation shortfall led to the emergence of various implementational problems, such as targeting issues, inaccurate amounts, and inconsistent distribution frequency
The insufficient national allocation as well as the inaccuracy of BPS's RTM data that is, some poor households were not listed while nonpoor households were listed as RTM were often used by regional governments to justify their divergence from the stipulated distribution mechanisms and target beneficiaries
3. Raskin's 2001-2005 General Guidelines stated that household beneficiaries should be determined during community consultative meetings at the village level (mudes) by referring to BKKBN's KPS and KS-1 data
However, Raskin's 2006-2007 General Guidelines do not stipulate that mudes must now refer to BPS RTM data
Furthermore, in the chapter on determining beneficiaries, there is no statement that beneficiaries must be poor households
Implementers can use these oversights to justify the distribution of Raskin rice to nonpoor households or the even distribution of Raskin rice to all households, as long as the decision is made during a mudes
4. The document review also reveals that mudes are not implemented in all villages/kelurahan
If a mudes does take place, the process is not ideal, does not involve most of the community members, and is generally not aimed at improving targeting
This is supported by field findings that mudes are only held in the sample villages in East Java and only with the aim to obtain agreement to distribute the rice evenly to all households regardless of their economic status
5. The document review shows that targeting is Raskin's weakest point, as some poor households are not listed as beneficiaries while nonpoor households are listed
Results of the analysis of Susenas data support this finding
a. Raskin is received by households from all prosperity groups (all quintiles of households based on household expenditure per capita)
Households in quintile 1 and 2, the least prosperous, only account for 53% of all beneficiaries; in other words there is 47% leakage
The three sample provinces in the study all demonstrate similar figures
b. During 2005-2006, the proportion of poor households reached by the Raskin program increased by 19.8 percentage points, from 62.9% to 82.7%
Unfortunately, the increased coverage of poor households was accompanied by an increase in the coverage of nonpoor households by as much as 8 percentage points, or an increase from 23.8% to 31.8%
c. The correlation between Raskin beneficiaries and RTM status between 2005 and 2006 increased from 40% to 48%, but the figure is still relatively low
6. Field findings show varied targeting accuracy
Targeting in West Sumatra is relatively accurate
In this region, BPS data is used, but minor adjustments are made as the data is considered to be slightly inaccurate
In East Java, rice is evenly distributed to all households regardless of socioeconomic status
In Southeast Sulawesi, targeting is inaccurate in some areas due to even or alternating distribution and accurate in other areas where the rice is only distributed to poor households
7. There have been several changes to the allocation of rice for each beneficiary household
The document review shows that when the stipulated allocation of rice was 20 kg per beneficiary household, beneficiaries received varied amounts that were generally below the stipulated levels, with some recipients only receiving two liters
The analysis of Susenas data shows that Raskin rice has been distributed to up to two or three times more beneficiaries than targeted, which has resulted in each household receiving less than the stipulated amount of rice
The results of field visits show that in 2007, with the stipulated amount of 10 kg, beneficiaries do not always receive their full allocation, with differences between the sample regions
In West Sumatra beneficiaries generally receive the correct allocation of 10 kg, while in East Java they only receive 4-7 kg and in Southeast Sulawesi they receive 4-10 kg
8. In theory, beneficiaries should receive Raskin rice each month, except in 2005 when it was determined that beneficiaries were to receive it only 10 times in a year
However, in practice, several documents show that beneficiaries do not receive the Raskin rice every month, and some have only received it once during a year
Results of the Susenas data analysis show that in 2003, beneficiaries only received Raskin rice five times over the course of a year on average
Field findings show that the frequency varies between regions
In West Sumatra and East Java, households generally received rice every month over a year, while in Southeast Sulawesi households received rice every 1-4 months
9. The General Guidelines stipulate that the price of Raskin rice at the distribution point is Rp1,000 per kilogram
The results of document review show that beneficiaries have paid between Rp1,000 and Rp2,900 per kilogram
The Susenas data analysis shows that beneficiaries paid more than the stipulated rate of Rp1,000 per kilogram, and the average price paid increases from year to year
Rp1,160 per kilogram in 2004, Rp1,225 per kilogram in 2005, and by 2006 it had risen to Rp1,253 per kilogram
Field findings show that the varying prices between regions were caused by the difference in cost of transporting rice from the distribution points and by the different policies used by local implementers
In West Sumatra, the established price was around Rp1,200-1,300 per kilogram, in East Java Rp1,000 per kilogram, and in Southeast Sulawesi the price ranged between Rp1,000 and Rp1,440 per kilogram
C. Funding Since 2002, the program has been funded by the national budget (APBN) or government internal resources (rupiah murni)
Moreover, some district/city governments allocate varying amounts of APBD funds to implement the Raskin program
Beneficiaries also contribute to program costs when they paid more than the stipulated rate
In general, the use of Raskin funds, whether sourced from the APBN, APBD, or the community, is still ineffective and inefficient
1. There have been several changes to the funding source of the Raskin program since the program was first implemented
During the first eight months, all program funding came from the APBN or rupiah murni
Following that until 2001, the program became part of the Social Safety Net program which was funded by the World Bank under the Social Safety Net Adjustment Loan (SSN-AL)
Since 2002, the funding has again been taken from the APBN or rupiah murni
2. The APBN allocation for the Raskin program has increased from year to year, reaching Rp6.28 trillion (approximately USD690 million) in 2007
During 2002-2007, the majority of Raskin program funds from the APBN were spent on rice procurement (41-57%) and cost for carryover stock histories (22-43%)
Other cost components were bank interest (7-9%), exploitation funds (5%), management fees (3%), and packaging costs (1-3%)
In this context, the APBN only funds program costs related to paying for rice from Bulog warehouses and getting it to distribution points
Regional governments are responsible for funding the operational costs of getting the rice from the distribution points to the beneficiaries through the APBD
3. The national average distribution cost for 2007 is around Rp173 per kilogram
The cost varies between regions, ranging from Rp105 per kilogram for Java and Rp1,855 for Papua
This includes not only transportation costs, but also supporting costs such as administration fees and the cost of reporting, program socialization, bonuses, official travel, and honorariums
4. Some district/city governments allocate APBD funds to cover the cost of their responsibility to distribute Raskin rice to beneficiaries from the distribution points
In West Sumatra, all district/city governments have provided funding in 2007 with varying amounts
As an example, Kabupaten Pasaman allocates Rp1.3 billion, while Kabupaten Agam only allocates Rp110 million
In East Java, only five districts provide such funding
Kabupaten Probolinggo (Rp62.8 million), Kabupaten Lamongan (Rp250 million), Kabupaten Lumajang (Rp112.7 million), Kabupaten Jember (Rp90 million), and Kabupaten Nganjuk (Rp156 million)
In Southeast Sulawesi, not one district or city provides special funding for the implementation of the Raskin program
5. The document review on the effectiveness of the use of Raskin funds showed two main opinions
The first is that the use of Raskin program funds is inefficient and ineffective because
(i) the program's targeting is inaccurate, resulting in the leakage of funds to households that are not entitle to receive the benefit
(ii) the program's operational costs are considered to be too high
and (iii) the difference between Bulog's cost price in obtaining rice and its selling price is too high
In 2003, from Raskin's budget of Rp4.83 trillion, only 18% benefited poor households, 52% benefited nonpoor households, and 30% was used for operational expenses and Bulog's profit
In the same year, it only cost Bulog Rp2,790 per kilogram to procure the rice, while they sold it to the government for up to Rp3,343 per kilogram
The second opinion states that the Raskin program is efficient as the operational or management costs are only 3%, lower than the operational or management costs for similar programs in other countries
6. Field findings support the opinion that the use of Raskin funds is ineffective and inefficient
This is shown by the inaccurate targeting and the allocation of honorariums to local officials
As an example, Bulog's subregional divisions in several regions provided funds of Rp25,000 per distribution to each distribution point, while the subregional division of Bojonegoro gave an honorarium to several officials at a total cost of Rp2,060,000 per month, or Rp24,720,000 per year
APBD funds for the Raskin program in Kabupaten Agam were also used to pay honorariums to implementing officials at the subdistrict level
These kinds of practices not only caused inefficiencies but also violated the guidelines governing the use of Raskin funds
Implementing the Raskin program is part of the job description for the aforementioned officials; as such they should not receive additional honorariums
7. The Raskin program also uses funds from the beneficiaries inefficiently
In West Sumatra for example, transportation costs of around Rp200-300 per kilogram of rice have been imposed on Raskin beneficiaries when the real costs were only around Rp44-125 per kilogram
Distributors and other village officials divided the excess funds between themselves as profit
In this case, the beneficiaries subsidized the distributors, who were generally not categorized as poor
D. Capacity Building The Raskin program did not specifically include a capacity building aspect for implementing institutions or the community
Although Bulog has provided assistance through tertiary institutions, the capacity building for implementers was not effective
1. Document review results show that in 2005-2006, Bulog asked ten universities to conduct a study and provide assistance in 12 provinces
The assistance aimed to help program officers at the village/kelurahan or distribution point level with program socialization, targeting, and distribution
These activities did not effectively build the capacity of program implementers as they were focused more as research activities and the areas that received assistances were very limited
For example, of the 900 villages in West Sumatra, Andalas University only provided assistance in 6 villages/kelurahan in 2005 and 12 villages/kelurahan in 2006
2. The field visits reveal that no efforts were made to give assistance to and to build the capacity of implementers or the beneficiaries in any of the three sample regions in 2007
E. Monitoring and Evaluation Various groups, both internal and external, have conducted monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities of the Raskin program and have given various feedbacks for the program
However, the feedbacks have generally not been followed up, that cause the implementation of the Raskin program is still not effective
1. Results of the document review and field visits reveal that internal M&E is carried out in stages based on the level of government by the central, provincial, and district/city Raskin teams regularly or as required, in a limited number of sample regions
The internal M&E activities are part of the control for the program and are aimed at evaluating how effective the Raskin program's implementation is according to the 6T performance indicators
However, in practice these M&E activities are conducted more like general investigations and complaint receiving exercises, and consequently have not achieved their intended objectives
Internal M&E activities have also tended to focus only on financial and administration aspects
2. Various institutions have conducted the external M&E, including universities, nongovernment organizations, research institutes, and international institutions
Most have evaluated the program's implementational processes, while evaluations of the program's impact are still limited and tend to look at the macro-level
In general, external M&E activities have provided information about program implementation on a case by case basis according to field findings and on a macro-scale based on analysis of secondary data
3. The field visit findings show that M&E activities in the sample areas do not reach the community level, stopping at the Raskin implementing officer at the subdistrict level
M&E activity is only found in one sample village in Southeast Sulawesi, but this was only in the form of a single visit by an NGO in 2007
4. The various M&E activities have resulted in feedbacks that resulted in some changes to the program regarding the data used as a targeting reference, the process of verifying beneficiaries through mudes, and the amount of rice allocated to each beneficiary
Nevertheless, any improvements to the program's design have not been followed up properly during implementation
Consequently, the Raskin program continues to be implemented in an inefficient and ineffective manner
F. Program Audit Program audits are conducted routinely in accordance with national regulations
Bulog has responded to the audit results appropriately with regard to the problems and the auditor's recommendations
1. Program implementation audits are regulated, inter alia, in Law No.15, 2004 on State Financial Responsibility Management Audit and the annually revised Minister of Finance Regulation on Bulog's Budget
The BPKP (the Financial and Development Supervisory Board) conducted the audits until 2004 and BPK (the State Audit Agency) took over the task in 2005
The two institutions have audited different aspects of the program
BPKP focused on aspects concerning the achievement of the program's implementation targets while BPK emphasizes on financial aspects
2. The results of the 2004 BPKP audit show that in 2003, the Raskin program's implementation performance at the national level reached 78.2% (from the ideal of 100%)
Raskin's performance on the targeted number of poor households only reached 59.4%
On the amount of rice was only 61.42% and only 68.5% on correct price
BPKP also found that distribution transaction documents were not sufficiently detailed, that a number of district/city governments had still not published technical guidelines, and the monitoring of rice distribution was weak
3. The 2006 BPK audit on Bulog's rice procurement and storage expenses for 2004 found several basic accounting errors
Before the audit, Bulog's claim to the government for procurement and storage expenses reached Rp350 billion, but after the audit, the total figure changed to Rp249 billion, a negative correction of Rp101 billion (29%)
This correction was necessary as Bulog had included other costs in the rice procurement and storage expenses
Bulog followed up the results of the audit in line with the findings and the auditor's recommendations, which included creating guidelines for goods/service procurement and sending reminder notices to regional governments with Raskin-related outstanding payments
G. Complaints and the Complaint Handling System
The complaints secretariats are ineffective as the community is not generally aware of their existence
Community members usually lodge any complaints with local implementers or village/kelurahan officials
Almost all complaints have not been resolved
1. In accordance with the Raskin General Guidelines, the Raskin program provides a community complaints secretariat at the provincial and district levels
The results of the document review reflect that the existence of the secretariats has not been socialized to the community and consequently they do not know where they should go to register their complaints
2. Even when there are problems, the community does not officially file their complaints
If community members have complaints, they usually lodge them with a village/kelurahan official or with a local implementer, and almost all complaints are not resolved
In general, complaints are not passed on to higher levels, except if they are related to rice quality
3. The field findings support the results of the document review
H. Level of Satisfaction and Program
Benefits Program implementers generally stated that they are not satisfied with the performance of the Raskin program
While beneficiaries generally stated that they are satisfied as they obtain a direct benefit from the program
1. The document review reveals that not a single regional government expressed satisfaction regarding Raskin's implementation
Instead, many stated that the regional governments are not satisfied with the program's implementation as it is not inline with the program objectives
One village official had complained that the program has negatively impacted the community's spirit of mutual cooperation (gotong-royong) and creativity
Although beneficiaries considered the program's targeting to be inaccurate, they considered Raskin's service quality to be satisfactory
2. Field visits results show that various informants from the provincial level down to the village/kelurahan level assessed several aspects of the program's implementation as still weak
Primarily the socialization of the program to the community, targeting, and the less than functional complaints mechanism
3. Although regional government officials are not satisfied with Raskin's implementation, they have differing attitudes towards the program's continuation
In East Java, some officials are of the opinion that the program does not need to be extended as its impact does not justify the cost
Whereas in West Sumatra and Southeast Sulawesi, some regional government officials are of the opinion that the program is still needed to help provide food for poor households
4. The results of FGDs with beneficiaries reveal that the most satisfying aspects of Raskin's implementation are price, payment methods, and distribution
Although a high proportion of beneficiaries pay more than Rp1,000 per kilogram for the rice, they do not object as it is still much cheaper than the market price, which was around Rp4,200 per kilogram during the field visits in August 2007
5. The FGDs with beneficiaries reveal that the most unsatisfying aspects of the program are the monitoring system, complaints system, and the amount of rice
The community was not satisfied with the program monitoring since there had not been any monitoring activities in their region
They were not satisfied with the complaints system as they were unaware of the community complaints secretariats and the official complaints mechanisms
The community was also not satisfied with the amount of rice they received as it was far below their household needs
6. The document review results reveal that Raskin is beneficial for beneficiaries because it can lessen their economic and rice need burdens and improve the quantity and quality of their consumption
It does this by providing in-kind income transfer to beneficiaries worth Rp20,500 per month, based on the assumption of a total transfer of benefits worth Rp3.25 trillion per year and of a total number of 13.2 million beneficiaries
In addition, Raskin is considered to be able to increase poor households' access to rice
7. The analysis of the field findings results shows that the economic benefit of Raskin for beneficiary households from income transfer is relatively small because the amount of rice that households receive and the frequency at which they receive it are below the stipulated levels
Moreover, beneficiaries often pay more than the stipulated price
Theoretically, each month Raskin beneficiaries would receive a subsidy equal to the difference between the market price and Raskin rice price of rice per kilogram multiplied by ten
At the time of the study, the average market price of medium quality rice was Rp4,200 per kilogram
Beneficiary households should be receiving a subsidy of Rp32,000 per month or Rp384,000 per year
In practice however, income transfer to beneficiary households in the sample areas ranges between Rp12,800-Rp29,000 per month or Rp38,400-Rp348,000 per year
This is because beneficiaries pay Rp1,000- Rp1,440 per kg, receive 4-10 kg, with a distribution frequency of 3-12 times per year
8. FGD participants mentioned several kinds of benefits they receive from Raskin
The three primary benefits of Raskin are assistance with food expenses, peace of mind for beneficiaries and their families, and assistance with school fees
Raskin reduces food expenses, so beneficiaries can have extra income that can be used for other necessary expenses such as school fees
Moreover, the FGD participants also mentioned that the Raskin program is able to hold back price fluctuations at the village level
I. Lessons Learned
Both negative and positive lessons can be drawn from the findings of this study in order to determine how successful the Raskin program has been in achieving its objectives
1. Positive Lessons 
a. Targeting accuracy is highly dependent on the level of commitment and roles of the regional government and implementers at the local level, socialization which stresses that the Raskin program is only for the poor households, the use of BPS data that has been verified at the local level, and the transparency of the list of beneficiaries
b. Price accuracy is dependent on whether or not rice is distributed directly to recipients from (primary) distribution points, the distance between the (primary) distribution point and the beneficiaries, and the size of the contribution from the APBD
2. Negative Lessons
a. The shortfall between the total allocation of RTM and the total number of RTM has caused targeting inaccuracies as well as inaccuracies in the amount of rice distributed to beneficiaries and distribution frequency
b. Targeting inaccuracy is influenced by weak socialization, community indifference, the lack of commitment from regional governments, and the shortfall in total rice allocation compared to the total number of RTM
c. The regional government's lack of commitment is influenced by their saturation with the already long-running program which has become routine, program implementation that does not reflect the objectives, and weak socialization
d. Price inaccuracy is influenced by whether or not rice is distributed from the primary distribution point and how far the distribution point is from household beneficiaries
e. Distribution delays are caused by outstanding payments from the distribution points
f. Distribution delays affect the community's readiness to allocate the time and prepare the funds to purchase the rice
g. The accuracy of distribution frequency and amount of rice that beneficiaries receive is not always a good indication of successful program implementation
Distribution frequency may be correct every month, but the amount of rice received may be below the stipulated amount, or vice versa
J. Recommendations
The Raskin program has been running for nine years and has used a significant amount of funds and involved many parties, but it is still not performing effectively
Therefore, Raskin should only be continued if the following conditions are met
a. The program needs to be revitalized
This can be done by implementing a guided national information campaign (socialization) to increase the awareness and real understanding of the program's essence for all stakeholders, including local implementing agencies and the community
These socialization activities must be clearly regulated in Raskin's General Guidelines
b. The allocation for beneficiary households at the national level must be firmly stipulated and in accordance with the total number of households in the targeted group
The target household category must be clearly defined, including whether it is limited to very poor households only or is to include poor or near poor households
c. One institution must be appointed to oversee those responsible for the distribution of rice starting from procurement down to distribution to the community in order to clarify the respective tasks, responsibilities, and performance evaluation
d. Local governments must be responsible for dividing rice allocation and ensuring accurate targeting of beneficiaries
To ensure accurate targeting, regional governments should verify the BPS data on RTM or other data which is used to determine targets at the national level
e. The maximum number of beneficiary households determined by verification at the village/kelurahan level must correspond to the total allocation the village has obtained in order to guarantee that each household receives the stipulated amount of rice
The subdistrict should be responsible for formally approving and validating the list of targeted households
f. Arrangements must be made for (primary) distribution points to be located closer to household beneficiaries so they can distribute rice directly to beneficiaries
g. A policy is needed to force regional governments to seriously support Raskin implementation through both providing funding support (through the APBD) and helping to achieve the program objectives
h. An incentive and penalty system should be introduced and implemented to ensure that the program is implemented in accordance with the guidelines
A reward should be given to regions or program implementers that successfully implement the program in line with the regulations, based on a set of predetermined indicators
Incentives could be in the form of an award
While penalties could take the form of media announcements identifying unsuccessful regions, or the dismissal, transfer of duties, or demotion of the implementing officials
i. A serious, planned, and accountable practice of monitoring and evaluation activities by independent and credible external institutions will help to guarantee the appropriate implementation of Raskin and will support the incentive and penalty system
The results of monitoring activities must be widely presented to various parties including the public and systematically used for the improvement of the program's implementation
j. All stipulations regarding the program's implementation, such as those concerning socialization, targeting (verification and data reference), and monitoring and evaluation must be clearly regulated in the program's guidelines
If those conditions are not met, Raskin should be ended and in-depth studies, including on the following aspects, will be required
a. the impact of Raskin's phase out on the food security of poor households;
b. the transfer of Raskin funds to another program that will provide better assistance for poor households;
and c. Bulog's role in the procurement and stabilization of the national price of rice, as currently more than 80% of the rice procured by Bulog has been distributed through the Raskin program
I INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
Raskin (rice for poor households) is a national program that aims to help households to fulfill their food needs and reduce their financial burden through the provision of subsidized rice
Since 2007 the Raskin program has been coordinated by the Coordinating Minister for the People's Welfare
The Logistics Agency (Bulog) is responsible for distributing the rice to the distribution points, while local governments are responsible for channeling the rice from the distribution points to poor households
In 2007 the Raskin program aimed to supply 1.9 million tons of rice to 15.8 million poor households
Each targeted household was to receive 10 kilograms (kg) of rice per month at the price of Rp 1,000 per kilogram at the distribution point
The total budget of Rp 6.28 billion was funded by the national budget (APBN)
The Raskin program is a continuation of the Special Market Operation (OPK), which was launched in July 1998 as part of the Social Safety Net (JPS)
The program has been evaluated several times since 1998, and the findings have provided feedback for how the program's concept and implementation could be improved
Various adjustments have been made, including changes to the program name, the quota of rice per household, distribution frequency, the sources and types of data on targeted beneficiaries, and the designation of institutions to provide assistance to local implementers
In 2002, the central government changed the name of the program from OPK to Raskin in order to reflect the change in the program's nature; whilst initially the program was an emergency program intended to overcome the impact of the economic crisis, it had since become part of the social protection program for poor households
The monthly quota of rice per poor household, which was originally set at 10 kg but in subsequent years varied between 10 kg and 20 kg, once again became 10 kg in 2007
In 2006, the distribution frequency, which had previously been 12 times per year, was reduced to 10 times per year, but in 2007 it was again raised to 12 times per year
Targeting had previously relied on data for preprosperous (KPS) families and prosperous level-1 (KS-1) families collected by the National Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN)
Since 2006, Statistics Indonesia (BPS) data for poor households collected in the PSE-052 has been used
In addition to these changes and in an attempt to improve the performance of the program, Bulog worked together with ten national universities in 2005 and 2006 to provide assistance teams for the implementation of Raskin in 12 provinces
Even though the government has endeavored to improve both the concept and implementation of Raskin, many still question the program's effectiveness
In light of this, the National Development Planning Board (Bappenas), with the support of the World Bank and the Decentralization Support Facility (DSF), has conducted an independent evaluation to study the effectiveness of the implementation of the Raskin program
The SMERU Research Institute, which has conducted a number of studies on Raskin, was given the task of undertaking this evaluation
1.2 Study Aim
The general aim of this study is to investigate the extent to which the implementation of the Raskin program has been effective and to examine implementation practices so as to obtain lessons relevant to program improvement
More specifically, this study seeks to answer the following main questions
Has implementation achieved the purpose of the program
Has the program reached the poorest members of the community
How have program monitoring, evaluation, and auditing been carried out
How is program funding structured and how effective is it
What is the level of stakeholder satisfaction with program implementation
How beneficial has the program been for the community
1.3 Methodology
The present study was conducted over a period of five months from July to November 2007
The main activity of the study was an examination of documents and secondary data analyses (meta-evaluation)
To complement meta-evaluation activities and at the same time obtain the most recent information, the study was supported by interviews with key informants at the central level and field research
In meta-evaluation activities, SMERU researchers examined 44 documents consisting of 7 Raskin General Guidelines, 23 research and evaluation reports made by a number of institutions, 4 audit reports, 4 presentations, 3 articles and 3 ministerial regulations
Although these documents were published throughout the implementation of Raskin, the majority (73%) appeared in the 2004-2007 period (Table 1)
A document review examined a number of decrees and circulars issued by governors, district heads, subdistrict heads and village/kelurahan heads and of the results of village consultative meetings (musyawarah desa or mudes)
In data analysis, SMERU researchers examined secondary data from Susenas for the years 2002-2006 as well as data from Bulog
Interviews with key informants at the central level were conducted with several stakeholders, such as government institutions, research institutes, universities, and nongovernment organizations (NGO)
A question guide was used to in the interviews to gain in-depth information about the implementation of Raskin and to discuss the results of research and evaluation carried out by the institution concerned
To obtain the latest information about Raskin's implementation, SMERU researchers conducted field studies in three provinces between 20 and 30 August 2007
One district (kabupaten) was selected in each province
Kabupaten Agam (West Sumatra), Bojonegoro District (East Java), and Kolaka District (Southeast Sulawesi)
The three districts were chosen purposively based on variations in location, level of rice production, Raskin rice allocation, poverty level, and availability of an accompanying institution from a university (Table 2)
In each sample district, one subdistrict (kecamatan) that received a fairly high and regular allocation of Raskin rice and at the same time had a high level of poverty was chosen
Two villages/kelurahan were selected in each subdistrict
one an urban or semiurban location or otherwise located close to the subdistrict capital, and the other a in rural location or otherwise far from the subdistrict capital
In all, field studies involved visits to six sample villages/kelurahan (Table 3)
During field visits the research team used several rapid survey methods such as direct observation, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions (FGDs)
Observations made at the community level involved, among other things, taking note of local living conditions, especially those of respondents
In-depth interviews were conducted with a number of stakeholders at the provincial, district, subdistrict, and village/kelurahan levels
Interviews were conducted with representatives from institutions such as Bulog regional divisions and subdivisions, government officials, universities, NGO, the local media, as well as local program administrators (the persons responsible for handling Raskin at the village level)
In-depth interviews were also held with recipient households and nonrecipient households, selected purposively based on housing distribution considerations
A semi-structured interview guide was used in all interviews with informants and respondents
Interviews sought information covering a number of aspects related to the implementation of the Raskin program, such as socialization, allocation, targeting, distribution, amount of rice received, price of distributed rice, capacity building, monitoring and evaluation, the complaints system, satisfaction levels, and program usefulness
One FGD was conducted in each village/kelurahan, totaling six FGDs
Approximately 16 beneficiaries attended each FGD
Participants consisted of roughly equal numbers of men and women (7-9 of each in each FGD) who normally purchase the rice or at least understand how Raskin is implemented in their village
All FGD participants were selected from separate households
The FGDs obtained information about the implementation of Raskin in the village concerned, participant knowledge about program management, satisfaction levels, and program usefulness
The data and information collected from the document review, in-depth interviews, and FGDs were analyzed using qualitative methods, while secondary data from the BPS Susenas were analyzed using quantitative methods
The study was carried out by seven SMERU researchers, consisting of two advisors, Sudarno Sumarto and Asep Suryahadi, and five researchers, namely, Hastuti, Sulton Mawardi, Bambang Sulaksono, Akhmadi and Silvia Devina
The study also involved one guest researcher, Rima Prama Artha, and three local researchers, namely, Joni Saputra (West Sumatra), Heri Rubianto (East Java) and Laode Udin (Southeast Sulawesi)
SMERU's librarian, Ratna Dewi, conducted the document review
The study findings are presented in four chapters
The introductory chapter describes the study background, objectives and methodology
The second chapter presents the findings concerning program implementation, covering the aspects of socialization, allocation, targeting, prices and payment, the funding structure, monitoring and evaluation, the auditing system, complaint handling, levels of satisfaction, and the usefulness of the program
The third chapter presents the positive and negative lessons that have been drawn from the evaluation of the program implementation
The fourth and concluding chapter offers recommendations for the future implementation of the program
II RESEARCH FINDINGS
Two agencies are responsible for the distribution of Raskin
Bulog and local government
Bulog is responsible for getting the rice to the distribution points, while the local government is responsible for distributing the rice from the distribution points to the target households
To date, Bulog has performed its task relatively well and in accordance with the implementation guidelines
This partial evaluation, however, cannot be used to evaluate the success of the program, as Raskin is a program that provides subsidized rice to poor households
Findings from the document review and field studies indicate that most of the problems associated with the implementation of Raskin occur between the distribution points and the recipient
According to the 2007 Raskin General Guidelines, there are six indicators (known as the 6 Ts) by which the level of Raskin success is measured, namely, accuracy in targeting, in amounts of rice, in pricing, in timing, in quality and in administration
On the whole, the results of the present study show that the effectiveness of Raskin program's implementation has been poor
This can be seen from the lack of socialization and transparency; the inaccurate targeting of recipients; inaccurate pricing, amounts of rice, and frequency of rice distribution; the high cost of program management; deficient monitoring; and the poorly functioning complaints mechanism
The following sections present details of these problems
2.1 Program Implementation
The performance of Raskin can be evaluated by looking at the aspects of socialization and transparency in information, allocations, targeting, distribution frequency, the amount of rice received by beneficiaries, rice prices and the payment system, and the use of funds
One way of measuring the performance of each of these aspects is to compare the extent to which the actual achievements revealed in information from the document review, the analysis of secondary data and field findings conform to Raskin's General Guidelines
2.1.1 Socialization and Transparency in Information
Socialization is one of the keys to successful program implementation
Nevertheless, the General Guidelines do not deal with this important activity in detail
For example, they do not clearly state the frequency and time of socialization at each level of government or at the community level, nor do they state who is responsible for implementing and funding the activity
Detailed rules should have been set down in the instructions for program implementation (juklak) prepared by provincial and district/city governments
Only a limited number of local governments prepared instructions for the program's implementation
The contents are merely a copy of the General Guidelines without any further detailed stipulations about various aspects, including socialization
The absence of any such stipulations, among others, has led to regional variations in socialization activities for local government officials and has caused the weak socialization to the community
This weak socialization has caused a lack of program transparency among the community
According to the 2007 Raskin General Guidelines, the purpose of socialization (or the dissemination of information) of the program is for the community, and specifically poor members of the community, to learn about the background, implementation mechanism, community rights and obligations, and complaints mechanism
Information can be disseminated through coordination and socialization meetings, the mass media, and other means such as booklets, brochures and stickers
Additional informal socialization can be carried out through revolving credit groups (arisan), customary (adat) gatherings, and religious gatherings
Socialization among the bureaucracy
According to the documents, socialization among those responsible for implementation in local government circles depends on a structural approach within the bureaucracy, that is, in a tiered manner down to the district or subdistrict levels
There were no specific meetings to socialize the program; rather it was discussed in general coordination meetings (rakor) (Anak Bangsa Peduli 2005
Institute for Empowerment and Development Studies 2005
There is the impression among the bureaucracy that socialization is not an important aspect because Raskin is merely a follow-up program to the OPK
Consequently, there is no specific agenda for socialization; rather it is based upon need (Hastuti and Maxwell 2003:12)
Field studies in the three sample districts show that coordination meetings are held at each level of government, from the provincial down to the village/kelurahan levels
At the provincial level these meetings are usually held twice a year
One of these is held at the beginning of program implementation, where the division of supplies to districts/cities is also discussed and in the middle or at the end of the year to plan the program for the following year and at the same time to evaluate the current year's program
These meetings are attended by persons from the agencies on the provincial Raskin team as well as representatives of district/city governments
At the level of the sample districts, implementation for coordination meetings varies and depends on the respective local governments, but at the very least a meeting is held at the beginning of program implementation to specifically discuss the division of supplies to each subdistrict and village/kelurahan
In Kabupaten Agam, coordination meetings are conducted at the beginning and end of the year
In addition, a routine quarterly meeting is held between the Bulog subdivision and Raskin administrators from the district government level
Raskin implementation and problems associated with the program are also discussed at every meeting of the district poverty eradication team
In Bojonegoro District, a coordination meeting is conducted twice a year but additional meetings are usually held if particular problems or topics need to be discussed
In Kolaka District, a coordination meeting is held only at the beginning of program implementation
This district-level meeting is normally attended by the district Raskin team and representatives from the subdistricts
Not all subdistricts conducted socialization activities in 2007
Tanjung Raya in Kabupaten Agam was the only sample subdistrict to carry out socialization at the beginning of the year of the program's implementation
The participants, who were all village heads (known locally as wali nagari) and neighborhood heads (known locally as wali jorong), met together to discuss the system of distributing the rice and the method used to determine the selling price to beneficiaries
At the village/kelurahan level, annual socialization is not conducted because Raskin is regarded as a long-running program that does not undergo much change from year to year
If any socialization meetings are held, usually only village officials and community leaders attend, without community involvement
The document review shows that socialization activities in the form of dissemination of the Raskin General Guidelines are generally limited to the district/city level (Lembaga Demografi FEUI 2003 33-34; PT Daya Makara UI 2006 85)
Although there are provinces and districts/cities that have prepared instructions for the implementation of Raskin, distribution of these instructions does not extend to lower levels of government (Lembaga Demografi FEUI 2003 33-34)
Field study findings also reveal that the distribution of the General Guidelines is very limited
Although some sample regions have prepared instructions for implementation, namely, the provinces of East Java and Southeast Sulawesi and the district of Kolaka, distribution does not reach down to the village/kelurahan level
As a result, program implementation at the village/kelurahan level normally depends more on verbal instructions issued at subdistrict or district level meetings
The same is also true at the community level; local distributors, who are actually spearheading the Raskin program implementation for households
In performing its duty, the staff usually guided only by verbal instructions that are normally issued informally by the village/kelurahan head or the subdistrict staff
At the same time, information channels like community service announcements on television and the distribution of brochures or posters, which were common several years ago, are no longer used
The community members who were respondents in the present study have never even heard of the brochures or posters that should have been placed in public places
A study carried out by Anak Bangsa Peduli (2006 40) in West Java reveals that socialization by local governments through the mass media only occurred in Garut District, which used the printed media and the radio
Andalas University (2006 3-6) reported that in West Sumatra socialization had at one time been carried out in the form of interactive dialogue on TVRI and through the printed media
Socialization among the community It was concluded from a review of a number of documents that socialization of the Raskin program among the community varies and on the whole is not optimal
The findings of a previous SMERU study indicate that at the village level there is no special socialization among the community (Fillaili et al 2007 70)
According to Andalas University, not one of the 12 villages for which assistance was provided had previously undertaken socialization (2006 3-15)
Brawijaya University stated that in Madiun District, a large number of villages did not undertake socialization, at 42% (2006 61)
The field findings show that there has never been any formal socialization among the communities in any of the sample villages/kelurahan
Variations in socialization activities caused variations in the sources of information about the program for the community
The village/kelurahan head is the initial source of information for the community, but information is generally forwarded informally and indirectly
According to LP3ES, the responsibility to pass on information about the program to the target families is entrusted entirely to the village head (2000 51)
However, according to Hastuti and Maxwell the village head generally does not give information directly to the community but rather passes it on to the hamlet head, the neighborhood (RT) head or community figures (2003 12)
Fillaili et al found that the community learned about the Raskin program not from the head of the village/kelurahan but rather from the RT head, neighbors and television (2007 92)
The field study findings also show that generally the village head is not the direct source of information on the Raskin program
On the whole, the community obtained information from the persons who handled Raskin distribution, such as RT heads and Family Empowerment and Welfare Team (TP PKK)
Socialization activities to the community were usually below optimal levels, which meant that many members of the community, including beneficiaries, do not understand the program as a whole
Hastuti and Maxwell, for example, reported that the information given to the community is limited to implementation aspects, such as the quota of rice per family, the price per kilogram and the methods of cost collection and payment (2003 13)
Additionally, information about the purpose of the program and the targeting of poor families are not emphasized
As a consequence of the lack of information, the change in name from OPK to Raskin, which had been hoped to sharpen targeting, was pointless
At the time of their study, Raskin was still better known among the community as a government distribution of sembako (the nine basic foods/materials), which meant that families not included among the target households still demanded to receive a share 
The field study findings similarly show that socialization is still weak and has not been carried out to the full
The result being that many people, including beneficiaries, do not understand the overall program
In fact, beneficiaries do not even have general information about the program, such as the meaning of the name Raskin, how much rice they should receive, the stipulated price of the rice at the distribution point, and the number of times per year that they should receive the rice
Nevertheless, the essence of the Raskin program as assistance in the form of rice from the government for poor households is understood by the wider community, even though this knowledge was not automatically applied in program implementation
Transparency of information The influence of limited socialization can be seen in the low level of program transparency to the community
Only one of the documents that were examined, stated that certain villages in one sample subdistrict placed information about Raskin on the village notice board (Brawijaya University 2006 69)
Efforts to provide transparency in the list of beneficiaries were reported in only a few documents
According to Hastuti and Maxwell, certain villages once had the list of recipients placed in the village head's office, but it was torn down by persons who demanded to become beneficiaries (2003 13)
In other villages the list of names was deliberately not put up because it was feared that an announcement of this kind would give rise to community claims
Meanwhile, the Institute of Demography (FE-UI 2003 89) and PT Daya Makara UI (2006 87) reported that the list of poor households was intentionally not announced for security reasons and to prevent the occurrence of undesirable consequences
These findings are supported by the field findings, which indicate that no information about the Raskin program is posted in public places or in places accessible by the community in most of the study areas
Accessible lists of Raskin recipients were found only in the sample villages in Kabupaten Agam
Local distributors made the lists of beneficiaries available and it was planned to put them up very soon in local mosques, in accordance with local efforts to use the mosque to announce poverty reduction programs
Weaknesses in program socialization and transparency has caused a number of negative effects to emerge, including
(i) the potential for corruption due to a lack of community control as a consequence of the lack of understanding of the program (Olken, 2006 856);
(ii) inaccuracy in targeting because community members who are not poor have demanded a share of benefits (Universitas Indonesia 2004 160);
(iii) the appearance of complaints, criticisms, and unrest or conflict in the community (Anak Bangsa Peduli 2006 47);
and (iv) a perception on the part of local governments that Raskin is a central government program and is therefore not their responsibility (PT Daya Makara UI 2006 84)
This false perception on the part of local governments influences their commitment to supporting the program's implementation, including the provision of funding support
2.1.2 Allocation Quotas and Target Households
According to Susenas data for 2002-2006, the proportion of Raskin recipients from all households in Indonesia has fluctuated between 36% and 45%
In West Sumatra, the proportion ranged from 11% to 24%, in East Java from 41% to 53%, and in Southeast Sulawesi from 35% to 59% (Figure 1)
These conditions are in line with the proportion of poor households in the respective regions
National decisions about the allocation of Raskin rice quotas are based on the availability of the budget for subsidies and on the number of target beneficiaries
At the national level, quotas are allocated to each province based on data on targeted beneficiaries after considering proposals submitted by the regional governments
After that, provincial governments decide on the allocation for each district and city, while the district and city governments subsequently determine the allocation for their respective subdistricts and villages/kelurahan
These shares are all set in proportion to the data for prospective recipients in each area
From the beginning of the OPK program until 2005, target beneficiaries were determined by the data for preprosperous (Pra-KS) families and prosperous-1 (KS-1) families obtained from the results of the BKKBN data collection, but since 2006, BPS data on poor households (RTM) has been used
The Raskin program is conducted throughout Indonesia without any distinction based on regional poverty level as poor households are found in all parts of the country
This is supported by the document review and data analysis
All regions, down to village/kelurahan level, receive a Raskin allocation
In actual implementation, however, some areas have not received Raskin for several months at a time
Hastuti and Maxwell found that some villages and subdistricts did not participate in the program for a long period of time, in some cases for more than a year (2003 14-15)
Reasons for this include being in arrears with payments, procedural deviations, or due to a request from the subdistrict
The subdistricts concerned regarded Raskin as a nuisance and felt that the rice that they received was not in proportion to the labor required and the risk that had to be borne
Fillaili et al also reported that as a consequence of disruptions in Raskin payments at the kelurahan level, several subdistricts in Tangerang did not submit proposals for Raskin rice allocations during 2004-2005 (2007 77)
The total national Raskin rice quota increased each year until 2002, after which it decreased, but in 2007 it rose again slightly
Meanwhile, the number of poor households that the program targeted has tended to increase from year to year
Although the proportion has risen, the total number of target households is still lower than the total number of poor households (Table 4)
For example, in 2007 the total number of poor households was 19.1 million but the the Raskin program target was only 15.8 million poor households, which meant that 3.3 million poor households did not receive a Raskin allocation
The implications were apparent in implementation problems such as targeting, and inaccuracy in the amount of rice received by beneficiaries as well as distribution frequency
In the three study regions, the allocation quotas and the numbers of targeted poor households changed, but the trends differed as can be seen in Table 5
In West Sumatra, allocation quotas and the number of target households increased
The rise in allocations is explained by the shift from BKKBN to BPS data and the subsequent increase in the number of poor households
Up to the subdistrict level, the number of targeted poor households was smaller than the total existing number of poor households, but the opposite happened in the sample villages
This can be explained by the fact that adjustments at the subdistrict level were made to the allocations per village based on information from village and neighborhood heads
In the sample neighborhoods however, the slight reduction in the number of target households was not a problem because changes had occurred in the economic situation of households and because some poor households had moved away or household members had died
This is also true for the increases in the number of targeted poor households, since some poor households had not been registered as being poor
In East Java the Raskin rice allocations experienced a fall in 2005-2006 but rose again in 2007
This, however, was not reflected in Bojonegoro District or in the sample subdistricts and villages in the same province
In these areas the 2007 allocation actually dropped by comparison with the amount provided in the previous year
This was caused by the small increase in the number or poor households in Bojonegoro district against the overall fall in the number of poor households in the sample subdistricts and villages in Bojonegoro in 2007
As in East Java, the Raskin rice allocation for Southeast Sulawesi was also reduced in 2005-2006 but rose again in 2007
In both East Java and Southeast Sulawesi, the quota for the number of targeted poor households was lower than the existing number of poor households
The document review showed that the shortfall caused several problems to emerge
The Institute of Demography) states that because the Raskin rice supply was insufficient for the total number of poor households the rice was distributed evenly, with beneficiaries taking turns to receive rice once every 2 to 3 months and with a reduction in the quota of rice per recipient (FEUI 2006 47
The same thing has been reported by Anak Bangsa Peduli (2006 12), PT Daya Makara UI (2006 95), IPB (2006 slide 4), and the University of Indonesia (2004 142, 149, 161)
Meanwhile, according to Brawijaya University, the shortfall in supply not only meant that recipients were given less than the stipulated amount of rice but also that it caused horizontal conflicts when the rice was distributed (2006 38, 121)
The Institute for Empowerment and Development Studies also reported that the fact that the supply was less than needed for the number of poor households created social jealousy and disharmony at the community level, at the same time causing difficulties for those handling village-level distribution when it came to prioritizing who most needed the rice (2005 74)
Field studies showed the same tendencies
The shortfall in the amount of rice supplied was used as an excuse by local-level program administrators to deviate from the official mechanisms for distributing the rice and determining targets
These deviations, which included reducing distribution frequency, rotating recipients, increasing the number of recipients and distributing the rice evenly
All of the deviations meant that target households did not receive the stipulated amount of rice
Deviations were also encouraged by inaccuracies in BPS data, that is, poor households that were not registered while on the other hand non-poor households that were registered as being poor
2.1.3 Determination of Target Beneficiaries
Village consultative meetings (mudes) According to the 2006-2007 Raskin General Guidelines, the BPS list of poor households, which represents data for the target households intended to benefit from the program, is to be used as the basis for setting allocations down to village/kelurahan level
At this level, a village consultative meeting is used to determine beneficiaries in a transparent and participatory manner by involving the various components of the community, including representatives of poor households
The 2001-2005 Raskin General Guidelines states that village meetings to determine target households are to refer to data on target families, at that time BKKBN data for KPS and KS-1 families
The 2006-2007 Raskin Guidelines, however, do not stipulate that the village meeting must refer to the BPS data on poor families
In fact, in the section entitled 'Determination of Beneficiaries', it is not stated that beneficiaries must be poor households
The absence of such a requirement can be used by program administrators as justification for distributing Raskin not only to poor households or for sharing it out equally, provided that the decision to do so is made during a village meeting
Although in the introduction to the Raskin General Guidelines it is stated that the Raskin program targets poor households, it is quite possible that program administrators do not use the guidelines in full
Especially since, as stated above, distribution of the Raskin General Guidelines itself is still very limited and does not extend to those handling implementation at the community level
The findings of the document review show that village consultative meetings are not held in all villages/kelurahan
Even in cases where such meetings were conducted, their implementation was still below optimum because there was insufficient community involvement and because on the whole the meetings did not seek to sharpen the targets
Andalas University reported that only one of the 12 villages (nagari) which they assisted had ever held a village meeting for this purpose and that the implementation was not complete (2006 3-15)
According to Hasanuddin University, not all villages/kelurahan have conducted village meetings to determine Raskin beneficiaries (2006 40)
In fact, IPB states that there have been virtually no village meetings for allocation, and, where there have been held, they have involved only the village head and the heads of villages and neighborhoods (RW and RT) (2006 slide 15)
Brawijaya University reported that village meetings have been conducted in two sample districts, but in one other district only a few of the villages held such meetings (2006 73, 79)
According to Hastuti and Maxwell, discussions were held in some villages; however, only village staff participated and the discussions were only intended to justify that the decision-making process had proceeded in accordance with the stipulations (2003 40)
University of Indonesia (2004 142, 150) and PT Daya Makara UI (2006 86) had similar findings, both stating that village meetings did not actually involve the community and that village meetings, which was really to verify data, did not fully realize their intended function
In fact, Hastuti and Maxwell (2003 30), Andalas University (1999 IV-25) and the University of Indonesia (2004 142) all reported cases of village meetings at which it was decided that the supply of rice should be shared out equally among all families, rich and poor alike
Field work revealed a situation fully in line with the findings of the document review
Of the six sample villages/kelurahan, only the two East Java villages held village consultative meetings
Even then, the aim of the meetings in these two villages was not to sharpen or verify the data concerning beneficiaries, but rather to decide that Raskin rice would be shared equally among all households
According to Brawijaya University, lack of funds and time limitations are the reason for why so many villages do not hold village meetings, or else they believe that it is sufficient for discussions to be held at subdistrict level (2006 74)
The Institute of Demography found that one reason for why village meetings are not conducted is that a list of recipients provided by BKKBN officials already exists (FEUI 2003 86)
Methods of determining beneficiaries As a consequence of the fact that village consultative meetings are not conducted in all areas and implementation is far from optimal, the method by which beneficiaries are determined varies from place to place
Some villages set targets through a village meeting, some use national reference data as the basis (BKKBN data or BPS data for poor households), and in some cases decisions are made by RT and RW heads or by village/kelurahan heads
In many cases these various methods ultimately result in a decision that the rice should be shared out equally among a greater number of households or among all households
The different reasons behind these decisions include prevention of conflict, insufficient supply of rice than is needed for the number of poor households, avoidance of social jealousy, the existence of demands from persons who were not entitled to receive the rice, and the need to reach deadlines for the sale and payment of the rice
Field studies also revealed variations in the ways in which beneficiaries are determined
In Kabupaten Agam, West Sumatra, the local government has put pressure on all Raskin administrators to use the BPS list of poor households
In the sample villages, program administrators at the community level have adjusted the list with the agreement of the village head because they regard the BPS data as inaccurate
They have adjusted the lists of beneficiaries by asking relatively well-off households to transfer their quota to unregistered poorer households
In some cases replacement of beneficiaries is done with the knowledge of the registered poor households although not routinely in each distribution
There are also those who make adjustments by increasing the number of recipients in such a way that beneficiaries obtain Raskin rice in alternate months or else they receive only a small quota of rice
Distributors at the village/kelurahan level select replacement or additional recipients after considering the socioeconomic situation of the households in question
The sample villages in East Java conduct village consultative meetings involving the community
However, these meetings are held only to decide that Raskin rice will be shared out equally among all households, without taking the economic status of the individual households into account
In one hamlet, only public servants, members of the army or police force and pensioned individuals are excluded from the equal distribution because they are considered to have a regular income and to be financially well-off
The policy of distributing equal shares is intended to prevent any social tension as a consequence of demands by nonpoor members of the community who believe that Raskin rice is a gift from the government and hence every household has the right to receive it
In the sample villages in Southeast Sulawesi, the Raskin rice distribution system differs from one village to another and even from one neighborhood to another
In Kelurahan Wolulu, officials in one neighborhood have applied a system of equal distribution among all households in an attempt to prevent any conflict and tension among residents, meaning that beneficiaries do not receive the full Raskin rice quota
In another neighborhood, a rotational system has been applied, which means that recipients do not receive rice every month
In the village of Sumber Rejeki, Raskin rice was only divided among a set number of beneficiaries in keeping with quota, determination of which referred to BKKBN data
Accuracy in targeting Several documents have concluded that the determination of target beneficiaries is the main weakness of the Raskin program because not all poor households receive Raskin rice while many nonpoor households do
The University of Indonesia came to the conclusion that in terms of effectiveness in implementation, Raskin has many problems related to targeting accuracy (2004 159)
Hasanuddin University stated that the problem with beneficiary targeting is still the main issue because there are poor households that do not receive Raskin rice and vice versa (2006 35)
The same finding was expressed by Andalas University, which stated that one of the weaknesses of the Raskin program is the fact that there are nonpoor recipient families that receive the rice (2005 3-16)
According to Sumarto and Suryahadi, Raskin reached 52.6% of poor households but the number of nonpoor households that benefited was also relatively high at 36.9% (2001 13)
The World Bank has even reported that more nonpoor than poor households receive Raskin rice (2006 215)
A number of other documents contain similar statements regarding inaccurate targeting
The results of the secondary data analyses point to the same conclusion
The analysis of Raskin targets and achievements in Table 6 shows that according to both Bulog and Susenas (BPS) data for 2002-2006, Raskin rice was distributed to a greater number of recipients than the number of target households
According to Bulog data, the ratio of recipient households to target households ranged from 128% to 147%, while data from Susenas indicate that the proportion was between 214% and 284% or approximately two to three times greater
If Raskin rice had only been distributed to the poorest households recorded in Bulog data, the program would have been able to reach 70% to 95% of existing poor households, while according to BPS data it would have even exceeded the number of poor households (127% to 152%)
Furthermore, with a total number of 50-59 million households between 2002 and 2006, the Raskin program should have been able to provide benefits for approximately 40% of households in Indonesia, and could have reached all households at the lowest level of prosperity, although the amount of rice would have been below the stipulated level
According to the Susenas results, however, Raskin rice was received by all household groups where grouping is based on quintiles of per capita expenditure
Households in quintiles 1 and 2, which are the least prosperous groups, constituted only 53% of total recipients
A similar pattern was found in the three sample regions, where Raskin recipients belonging to quintiles 1 and 2 constituted only 44% to 63%
By contrast, Raskin rice was received by households classed as nonpoor in quintiles 3 to 5, despite the fact that these households should not have obtained Raskin rice at all
This means that leakage of 47% occurred at the national level and between 37% and 56% in the sample regions (Table 7)
The extent of targeting accuracy can also be judged by comparing the proportions of poor and nonpoor households that the program does or does not reach
Analysis of Susenas data shows that in the 2005-2006 period, the proportion of poor households reached by the Raskin program rose by 19.8 percentage points from 62.9% to 82.7%
Unfortunately, this increase in poor beneficiaries was accompanied by an increase of 8 percentage points in the nonpoor households that benefited, namely, from 23.8% to 31.8% (Table 8)
Between 2005 and 2006, the correlation between Raskin recipients and poor households in Indonesia increased from 40% to 48% but the value remained low
The correlation between Raskin recipients and poor households in the three sample regions also increased
The correlation in Southeast Sulawesi increased quite a lot from 43% to 65%, whereas in West Sumatra and East Java the rises were relatively smaller, moving from 36% to 50% and from 41% to 47% respectively (Table 9)
The results of the field studies show interregional variations in the determination of targets
Targeting is relatively accurate in the sample villages in West Sumatra, but even so a small number of poor households still do not receive Raskin rice while some nonpoor households do
Targets in the sample villages in East Java are not accurate because a system of equal distribution is applied, which means that households in all categories receive rice
In the sample villages in Southeast Sulawesi the accuracy of targets varies
One sample village applies a rotational system and an equal share system, as a consequence of which both poor and nonpoor households are recipients
Targeting in the other sample villages is relatively accurate because Raskin rice is only distributed to households entitled to receive it
The document review reveals the existence of villages that have implemented the Raskin program relatively accurately as far as targeting is concerned, although only in a limited number of areas
Hastuti and Maxwell showed that targeting accuracy is influenced by the determination and commitment of the village head to distribute Raskin rice only to poor households (2003 47)
The local community accepted this policy because the village head socialized the fact that Raskin rice is intended only for poor households and because transparency existed on the part of recipient households
It proved possible to carry out this practice despite the fact that there was a tendency in neighboring villages for Raskin rice to be shared out equally among all households
Field findings in West Sumatra also show that targeting accuracy is influenced by commitment on the part of program administrators
In this region, governments from the provincial down to the village/kelurahan level support the Raskin program as part of the attempt to activate the poverty eradication program
Local governments include the successful handling of the Raskin program as an indicator in the performance evaluation of lower-level governments
Local governments stress to program administrators the need to use BPS data for poor households when identifying Raskin beneficiaries
Lists of beneficiaries are provided down to officials handling distribution
The community knows about the data and has easy access to these lists
Targeting accuracy is also encouraged by the efforts of various parties to increase community understanding that Raskin rice is the right of poor households
In addition, an award was recently (2007) given to the district/city government that best managed Raskin rice distribution, with the expectation that an award of this kind will encourage all of districts/cities to try to obtain similar recognition in coming years
In Southeast Sulawesi, targeting in one study village was accurate because the supplied amount of rice was in accordance with the existing number of poor households
In addition, efforts are often made to include socialization of the Raskin program for the community at village meetings
2.1.4 Frequency of Distribution and Receipt of Rice
Since July 1998, rice allocated through the Raskin program has been distributed every month or 12 times a year, except in 2006, when it was distributed only 10 times (Table 10)
Distribution frequency for 2007 was set at 12 times, yet there is a possibility that in reality the frequency will be lower because of the increase in the price of rice
When the National Budget was approved the price of rice supplied by Bulog was set at Rp3,550 per kg, but in reality there has been a price increase since June
At the time of the research the price had reached Rp4,000 per kg
Consequently, there is a possibility that Raskin rice will not be distributed for the month of December unless the government increases the budget
Several documents state that distribution frequency is in line with stipulations in the majority of regions
Nevertheless, there are some regions where frequency has been lower for various reasons
Hastuti and Maxwell (2003 29), the Institute of Empowerment and Development Studies (2005 56) and the University of Indonesia (2004 161) have all reported the existence of regions that have requested that Raskin rice be distributed once every two months because of allocation shortages
According to Tabor and Sawit, in West Nusa Tenggara Raskin is only distributed in the preharvest period because during the harvest season there are plenty of employment opportunities and foods is available (2006 35)
In that case, the region had actually received the correct amount of Raskin rice according to the quota for one year, but it was not distributed every month
Brawijaya University states that some villages have not received Raskin rice every month because of administration and payment problems (2006 94)
Field visits have indicated that Raskin rice is distributed regularly and in accordance with stipulations in the three sample regions, except in Kolaka District
In this district the amount of rice that is received is smaller than needed for the total number of poor households and so a decision has been made to distribute the allocation only nine times a year
One district in West Sumatra Province does not carry out monthly distribution, namely, the District of the Mentawai Islands
There rice is distributed once every four months because the area is located far from the provincial capital and can only be reached by sea transportation, which is greatly affected by weather conditions
Distribution frequency at the regional level is not always the same as the frequency with which target households receive the rice
Target households may not always access Raskin rice at each distribution because a rotation system may be in place
In other cases households cannot obtain the rice because they do not have the money to pay for it or because they have not been informed that the rice has arrived
Documents reveal that while beneficiaries do not always obtain Raskin rice every month, there are even some cases where they have received it only once in a year
IPB states that frequency of rice receipt in its study areas varied from 1 to 10 times a year rather than 12 times IPB (2005 slide 12- 13)
Anak Bangsa Peduli also stated that quite a lot of respondents (20% to 23%) only purchased Raskin rice 1 to 3 times in 2005 (2006 37, 45)
The Institute of Demography (FEUI 2003 39) and Andalas University (2006 3-22) also found that beneficiaries in several villages could not buy Raskin rice every month or else they bought it only once in 2 or 3 months because recipients took turn to do so
At the same time, when distribution frequency was fixed at 10 times a year in 2006, Fillaili et al reported that respondents received the rice once 1 to 6 times in that year (2007 94)
Analysis of Susenas data supports the document review findings
The frequency at which households at the national level and also in the three sample provinces received rice ranged from 1 to 8 times
This means that no households in the Susenas sample received Raskin the full 12 times during 2002
On average, households received the rice only 4 or 5 times a year, or less than 50% of the stipulated frequency (Table 11)
In the study regions, the majority of beneficiaries were able to obtain rice at each Raskin rice distribution
In the study areas in West Sumatra, most recipients obtained the rice once every month
Beneficiaries who did not obtain rice at each distribution were found in one hamlet where a rotation system was applied for certain households that were not regarded to be among the poorest households, which meant that they received Raskin rice every second month
Beneficiaries in the sample villages in East Java on the whole obtained Raskin rice every month
In the sample villages in Southeast Sulawesi, some recipients were able to obtain the rice in accordance with the distribution timetable, that is, 9 times per year
But in areas that applied an equal allocation system or a rotation system, beneficiaries received rice only 3 to 4 times a year
2.1.5 Amount and Quality of Rice Received by Beneficiaries
Each year, the distribution of the Raskin rice allocation at the national level is almost fully realized, at the rates of 95.13-99.97% (Table 12)
Bulog distributes the rice allocation to the distribution points all over Indonesia, which numbered more than 50,000 in 2007
However, this alone does not adequately reflect the program's distribution success; rather, the accuracy of both the quantity and quality of the rice received by beneficiary households must also be taken into account
Quantity of rice received by beneficiaries The quota of Raskin rice per targeted household per month has experienced several changes
After being set at 20 kg for several years, the Raskin monthly quota per household fell to 15 kg in 2006 and to 10 kg in 2007 (Table 13)
The rice quotas per household in 2001, 2005, and 2006 are different with the General Guidelines
That is, for those years, the General Guidelines did not firmly set the amount of rice for each targeted household but put it within a certain range
In 2005, for instance, the General Guidelines allowed the distribution of between 10 and 20 kg per beneficiary household, whereas the allocation was set at 20 kg
While on one hand this gave program administrators room to reach poor households that do not receive a quota, but on the other hand, it opens up opportunities for deviation
The document review reveals that the quantity of rice that beneficiary households receive varies and is generally less than the allocation to which they are entitled
In fact, when the rice quota was set at 20 kg, some beneficiaries only received 2 liters
The World Bank (2005 3) has suggested that on average, beneficiaries only received 6-10 kg per distribution
University of Indonesia (2004 142) stated that the figure is 8-16 kg per distribution
Andalas University (2006 3-22) also reported that some beneficiaries only received 3 kg
Bogor Agriculture Institute (IPB) found that beneficiaries in Kabupaten Bogor received an average of only 2-4 kg per month and those in Kabupaten Sukabumi received an average of 6-8 kg per month (2005 slide 12-13)
The result of the analysis of Susenas data shows that Raskin rice is distributed to more than 2 to 3 times the targeted number of beneficiary households and that consequently each beneficiary received less rice than they should have (Table 14)
According to Bulog data, beneficiaries received 9.8-14.9 kg per month, while according to BPS Susenas data they received 5.7-8.9 kg per month
These amounts only reach 65%-78% and 35%-45% of the total allocation quota per beneficiary respectively
Similar findings were also obtained during the field visits, which showed that since the rice allocation has been determined at 10 kg, beneficiaries have not always received the correct amount, with differences found between regions
In the sample villages in West Sumatra, beneficiaries usually receive the stipulated quantity of 10 kg per month
Beneficiaries who received less Raskin rice than is stipulated, at only 10 liters, were only found in one neighborhood
This was caused by the fact that distributors had added unregistered poor households as beneficiaries, with the approval of the village and neighborhood heads and with the knowledge of registered beneficiaries
In one sample village in East Java, beneficiaries received 4-7 kg per month because Raskin rice was distributed evenly among all households
While they received less rice than they should have, the community did not fault this as they emphasized the importance of togetherness
In the case of Kabupaten Kolaka, Southeast Sulawesi, variations in the quantity of rice received did not only occur between villages or kelurahan, but also between hamlets
In one hamlet which alternated distribution, beneficiaries received the correct amount of 10 kg, but did not receive the rice during every distribution
In another hamlet of the same village which evenly distributed the rice, beneficiaries only received 4 kg each distribution
In a different sample village the number of beneficiaries was the same as the target, and so each beneficiary household received the correct amount of 10 kg in each distribution
Rice Quality According to the General Guidelines, Raskin rice is to be of medium quality and in good condition without any blighting or pests, in accordance with the government purchase quality standards as regulated in legislation
The document review shows that beneficiaries received rice of varying quality, with the majority of a satisfactory condition but occasionally spoiled
According to FEUI Demography Institute, only a few sacks contained rice of an unsatisfactory quality (2003 24)
During the initial stages of the OPK program the quality of the rice was often criticized
However, over the following years the quality of Raskin rice tended to improve
According to Hastuti and Maxwell, the quality of Raskin rice in the sample regions was of an acceptable standard (2003 25)
IPB (2005 slide 25), the West Java Raskin Program Monitoring and Evaluation Team (2005 slide 10, 16, 27), and Andalas University (2006 3-24) reported that the majority of respondents stated that the rice they received was suitable for consumption
University of Indonesia (2004 145) also reported that the quality of Raskin rice was not particularly different to quality of the rice that beneficiaries usually consume
The field study results support the results from the document review
Respondents in the three sample regions stated that the Raskin rice they had received to date was of a good quality or equal to the quality of the rice they usually consume
However, in past years they had sometimes received poor quality rice that smelled bad, was infected with pests, or was yellow in color
2.1.6 Price Paid by Beneficiaries and Payment Systems
Since the program was initially implemented in 1998, the price of Raskin rice has been set at Rp1,000 per kilogram at the distribution point
The results of the document review show that in reality, beneficiaries pay prices varying between Rp1,000-2,900 per kilogram
The majority of the documents state that there are beneficiaries who pay the correct amount of Rp1,000 per kilogram
But all of the documents also state that some beneficiaries have paid above that amount
In fact, according to IPB (2006 slide 12), in some of their sample regions the price reached Rp3,750 per kilogram (Table 15)
Based on the Susenas 2004-2006 data, the national average for the price paid by beneficiaries has exceeded the stipulated rate and has increased from year to year
This is also reflected in the three sample provinces (Table 16)
Out of the three sample regions, West Sumatra recorded the highest prices and East Java the lowest
The field findings show that beneficiaries pay varying prices per kilogram among the three sample regions
In the sample villages in West Sumatra, beneficiaries paid between Rp1,200- 1,300, in East Java they paid Rp1,000, and in Southeast Sulawesi they pay between Rp1,000 and Rp1,440
In East Java, the price is in accordance with the stipulated price as distribution points are located in each village and hence also function as direct distribution points
The price is higher in West Sumatra as the primary distribution points are only located in subdistrict offices, which are located up to 25 kilometers from where the rice is distributed
In Southeast Sulawesi, depending on whether the rice is distributed to beneficiaries from direct or secondary distribution points, prices are either accurate or inaccurate
It can be concluded from the above facts that the factors contributing to the accuracy of the price of Raskin rice include the distance of the distribution point from beneficiaries and the function of the distribution point, that is, whether it is only a primary distribution point or whether it also functions as a secondary point from where the rice is distributed to beneficiaries
Several studies have found that the price of Raskin rice is determined by transportation costs
Differences in the price of Raskin rice can be influenced by the provision of packaging (plastic bags, sacks, buckets) from beneficiaries (Institute of Empowerment and Development Studies 2005 34; Institute of Demography (FEUI 2003 22) and the size of the contribution from the regional budget (APBD) (Andalas University 2006 3-23)
Price variations have also been influenced by the policies that determine the price, the majority of which have been decided by local implementers
Hastuti and Maxwell reported a tendency for village heads to have the greatest role in the determination of the Raskin rice price (2003 35)
According to USESE Foundation (2006 56, 64, 69) and FEUI Demography Institute (2003 19, 88-89), price determination methods vary, sometimes including community meetings, or otherwise prices are decided by RT/RW heads, PKK members, or the village head
However, according to the Institute of Empowerment and Development Studies (2005 67), PT Daya Makara UI (2006 93), and Hasanuddin University (2006 39), the village head and beneficiaries determine the price together
The field findings show that various methods are used to decide upon the price
In the sample villages in West Sumatra and Southeast Sulawesi, the village head or distributor determines the price, while in East Java a village meeting is held for that purpose
While beneficiaries are not involved in the price determination process in all locations, they generally accept the suggested price as it is always less than the market price
Beneficiary households generally pay for their Raskin rice with cash (cash and carry)
In several cases households pay before the rice arrives, but in other cases they can pay after they have collected the rice
The requirement to pay for the rice with cash can mean that beneficiaries are not able to purchase it when the rice arrives
According to FEUI Demography Institute, if a poor household were unable to redeem rice, then their quota would be offered to other households who are not necessarily poor (2003 18)
Distributors transfer the money collected from beneficiaries to program administrators at the distribution points
The administrators will then transfer the money to the Bulog subregional division directly or via bank transfer
Usually, the implementers at the distribution points are given leeway of up to two weeks after the rice distribution to transfer the funds
The disbursement of funds from the distribution points determines the timing of the following disbursement of rice
Bulog will not distribute the rice if the funds have not been received
2.1.7 Capacity Building
The Raskin program does not have a special agenda to increase the capacity of implementing institutions or the community
It is only designed to provide subsidized rice for poor families in order to reduce their food expenditure
Nevertheless, in 2005-2006, Bulog invited 10 tertiary institutions to conduct a study and assist in 12 provinces
To carry out their assignment, the universities placed students in several villages/kelurahan to assist the Raskin administrators with aspects of socialization, target determination, distribution, and payments, and also provided feedback to Bulog
The assistance from the tertiary institutions to village/kelurahan -level administrators is not effective as it is a research-focused project and the areas of assistance are limited
For instance, Andalas University only provided assistance in 6 villages/kelurahan in 2005 and 12 villages/kelurahan in 2006, out of a total of 900 villages/kelurahan in West Sumatra
In addition, the assistance was only provided for 2 months each year
The field study did not find any assistance or capacity building efforts for implementing institutions or beneficiaries in the three sample regions
In fact, in one sample village in East Java that should have received assistance from a tertiary institution, there was no sign of information that confirmed the village had actually received any assistance
Nevertheless, although not specifically provided, capacity building can also result from the experience of implementing the program
Program implementers can obtain additional knowledge and skills, such as planning, target determination, distribution methods, management, complaint handling, and reporting
For other groups, such as tertiary institutions, NGO, and research institutes, Raskin implementation can be used as a source of knowledge through the implementation of research or monitoring and evaluation activities
Tabor and Sawit have stated that Raskin functions as a laboratory that is beneficial for building the capacity of civil society at various levels via monitoring activities and program accountability (2006 61)
2.2 Funding Structure
In accordance with the national scale of program operations, the central government is primarily responsible for the Raskin program's funding
There have been several changes to funding sources since the program's initial implementation
According to Tabor and Sawit, during its first eight months the program was entirely funded by APBN routine funds (rupiah murni) (2006 98)
After that and until 2001, the program was included as one of the Social Safety Net (JPS) programs and was entirely funded by soft loans from the World Bank, IMF, World Food Programme (WFP), and grants and bilateral aid through the Social Safety Net Adjustment Loan (SSN-AL)
In 2002 the program split from the JPS and since then it has again been funded by APBN routine funds
In addition to the APBN, Raskin's implementation is subsidized by funds sourced from regional budgets and the community
2.2.1 Funding Amounts
The government has increased its allocation of funds for the Raskin program from year to year in line with the increases in the number of targeted RTM
In the program's first year (1998- 1999), Rp2.67 trillion of APBN funds was allocated (Tabor and Sawit 2006 107)
In 2007, Raskin funding had increased to Rp6.28 trillion (Table 17)
Average annual increase of 15%
The General Guidelines ask that regional governments allocate APBD funds in line with their responsibility to distribute rice to beneficiaries from the distribution points, 
Provincial governments are asked to provide a budget for program support, coordination, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
District/city governments are asked to allocate a budget for operational costs from the distribution points to the beneficiaries, as well as for the establishment of a Community Complaints Unit (UPM), coordination, and M&E
According to University of Indonesia, regional government commitment via the APBD is needed to provide advance funds (dana talangan) and the cost of distribution and socialization (2004 153- 156)
Only one of the five sample districts provided advance funds and not one provided operational costs
Anak Bangsa Peduli stated that they found one sample district that provided operational costs and another that provided improvement costs (2006 33, 40)
Conversely, Andalas University stated that all districts/cities in West Sumatra had provided co-funding but in varying amounts and that only one city provided advance funds (2006 3-26 and 3-27)
The field findings show that regional government funding support for the Raskin program varies
The regional governments of the sample regions in West Sumatra are reasonably responsive in providing Raskin funds, with all districts/cities contributing but in varying amounts
As an example, in 2007, Kabupaten Pasaman provided Rp1.3 billion while Kabupaten Agam provided Rp110 million
In East Java, according to the Community Empowerment Board (Bapemas) for August 2007, only five districts have allocated a budget for conducting Raskin activities
Kabupaten Probolinggo (Rp62.8 million), Lamongan (Rp250 million), Lumajang (Rp112.7 million), Jember (Rp90 million), and Nganjuk (Rp156 million)
However, not one district/city government in Southeast Sulawesi allocated APBD funds to support the Raskin program
The General Guidelines also encourage the community to contribute towards the cost of distributing the rice from the distribution points to beneficiaries
This is realized in the form of payments for the rice that are higher than the official price of Rp1,000 per kilogram at the distribution points
The results of the document review and field study show that these community contributions vary, as outlined in subchapter 2.1.6 on the price that beneficiaries pay for the rice
2.2.2 Use of Funds
Technically APBN funds for the Raskin program are used to fund three main activities, which are procurement, storage, and distribution of the rice to the distribution points
Table 17 details the use of APBN funds for Raskin, the majority of which are used for rice procurement, during 2002-2007
According to Tabor and Sawit, during 2002-2004, the majority of the Raskin budget was used to fund rice procurement (41-57%) and historic stock carryover (22- 43%) (2006 41)
Other components include bank interest (6.7-9.0%) and exploitation cost (5.1-5.3%)
Management costs, often used as a measuring rod for the efficient use of funds for a program, only accounted for 2.5-2.8% of the budget
For 2005-2007, Bulog's data on the use of APBN funds indicates a similar pattern
Nevertheless, during the period 2002-2007, the different funding components show different tendencies
The procurement and packaging costs fluctuate, while operational costs, management fees, bank fees, and interest all experienced significant increases
In the provincial and district/city levels, the cost of distributing the rice to the distribution points still falls under the responsibility of the APBN
Nationally, in 2007 the average distribution cost reached Rp173 per kilogram
At the provincial level, distribution costs from the APBN vary between Rp105 per kilogram for Java to Rp1,855 per kilogram for Papua
In West Sumatra, distribution costs are around Rp141 per kilogram, with the exception of the Mentawai Islands (Rp411 per kilogram), which are difficult to access
In East Java, distribution costs are maintained at Rp102 per kilogram, and Rp114 per kilogram for Bulog's Bojonegoro subregional division, which includes three districts
In fact, distribution costs from the APBN are not only used for transportation fees, but also for supporting costs such as administration fees, reporting costs, socialization, official travel, and honorariums
For example, in the Bojonegoro subregional division in East Java, the total Raskin operation costs for July 2007 reached Rp280.8 million to distribute 2,456 tonnes of rice to 1,232 distribution points
The majority of the funds are reserved for the cost of transporting rice from Bulog to the distribution point (43% or Rp49 per kilogram) and costs at the distribution point (25% or Rp28 per kilogram)
There are also supporting costs, mostly consisting of the cost of honorariums and official travel (Table 18)
The cost of honorariums includes honorariums for members of regional Raskin teams and other related parties
The policy regarding the provision of honorariums is not formally regulated by Bulog, rather it depends on the respective regional or subregional division and the consideration of conditions in each region
One subregional division gives program administrators honorariums of Rp25,000 per distribution
While another gives honorariums to the relevant official or agency
Regarding the use of APBD funds, several documents that report that regional governments provide APBD funds for administering Raskin do not provide details regarding the use of the funds
The documents only state that APBD funds are used for operational costs, improvement costs, and as advance funds
Nevertheless, Andalas University reported that APBD funds in Kabupaten Pasaman are used for the cost of distributing rice, so that beneficiaries only pay Rp1,000 per kilogram (2006 3-23)
The field study shows that APBD funds are generally used to fund the activities of the Raskin administration team
In West Sumatra, Rp18 per kilogram of APBD funds are used for incentives for subdistrict-level program administrators
In the sample subdistricts, there are six program administrators including the subdistrict head, so each of them receives Rp75,000 per distribution
In East Java, the majority of APBD funds are used for the operational costs of Raskin coordination teams in each district, not for distributing the rice or to make up for shortfalls in the amount of rice received
The funds sourced from the community from payments for the rice that exceed the stipulated price are generally used for the cost of transporting the rice from primary distribution points to the secondary distribution points
Transportation costs also include loading and unloading and incentives for officials
According to Tabor and Sawit, from 2002 to 2004, the community contributed Rp190 per kilogram, Rp210 per kilogram, and Rp250 per kilogram, totaling Rp425 billion in both 2002 and 2003 and Rp515 billion in 2004 (2006 41)
2.2.3 Effectiveness and Efficiency of Funds Usage
The performance of a program is determined by the effectiveness and efficiency of its use of funds
Indicators for this include the appropriateness of the use of funds, the unit cost of activities, and the outcome of the activities
Based on the document review, there are two opinions concerning the effectiveness and efficiency of the use of Raskin funds
The first opinion states that the use of Raskin funds is ineffective and inefficient (World Bank 2003 63; 2005 3; 2006 215) 
The arguments behind this view are
(i) the Raskin program's targeting is flawed as it has resulted in the leakage of Raskin funds to households who are not entitled to receive the benefit
In 2003, poor households only benefited from 18% of the total budget of Rp4.83 trillion
The majority (52%) of the budget actually benefited nonpoor households
This is supported by the Susenas data covered in section 2.1.3, that targeting leakage has reached 47%
(ii) program operational costs including Bulog's profit are considered to be too high, accounting for 30% of the total Raskin budget
(iii) the difference between Bulog's procurement costs and the price they charge the government for rice is too high
In 2004, the government paid Rp3,343 per kilogram, whereas rice could be obtained from private enterprises for Rp2,800 per kilogram
Table 19 shows the differences between the cost of procurement and Bulog's selling price
The difference between the two prices ranges between 12% and 20%, or an average of 16% per year
The second opinion, which states that the implementation of the Raskin program is effective and efficient, is only based on the proportion of program management costs to total program cost (Tabor and Sawit 2006 39-42)
From 2002-2004, Raskin management costs only accounted for 2.66%, 2.38% and 2.43% of the total budget
These figures are quite low when compared to the standard management costs of international social assistance programs
A management cost ratio of 10% is usually considered to be good according to international standards
The management costs of some social assistance programs in Europe even reach 12-15%
Although they stated that management costs are low, Tabor and Sawit (2006 42) also stated the need to significantly reduce the cost of the Raskin program as it uses short-term commercial credit, it has higher distribution costs than needed, the quality of rice in the program is lower than it should be, it has a higher historic stock carryover than needed, and Bulog use temporary workers to manage the program
According to Tabor and Sawit, inaccurate targeting, which accounts for a significant portion of the program's implementational costs, cannot yet be used to evaluate the efficiency of Raskin funds usage (2006 35-37)
They noted that there are still weaknesses in the data and differing perceptions regarding poverty and food security, and as a result it is difficult to conclude whether or not the Raskin program's targeting is appropriate
The field study results indicate that the use of Raskin funds is ineffective and inefficient
This can be concluded from the inaccurate targeting and funds utilization (see section 2.1.3)
The inappropriate use of funds is indicated by the use of APBN Raskin funds for honorariums for local officials and agencies
As an example, several Bulog subregional divisions provided funds of Rp25,000 per distribution point
In a more extreme case, another gave honorariums to officials and agencies administering the program from the district level to the village level, totaling Rp2,060,000 per month or Rp24,720,000 per year (Table 20)
If this practice was carried out nationally it would absorb Raskin funds of around Rp40 billion per year
The inefficient use of funds in the Raskin program is not limited to the use of APBN funds, but also occurs with APBD funding
An example of this was found in Kabupaten Agam, where APBD funds were used to provide honorariums to subdistrict program administrators
Apart from being inefficient, the practice of giving honorariums also breaches the regulations for the use of the budget
As the role of each official involved in the implementation of the Raskin program is part of their respective job descriptions, they should not receive any additional honorarium or incentive
The field findings also show that funds sourced from beneficiary households are also used inefficiently
In a sample village in West Sumatra, for example, beneficiaries pay between Rp1,200 and Rp1,300 per kilogram
Which means that Rp200-300 per kilogram is budgeted for the cost of transporting the rice from the primary distribution point to the secondary distribution point
However, as the real transportation cost is only Rp44-125 per kilogram, there are excess funds of Rp154-175 per kilogram
The community is not informed about the excess funds from beneficiaries in a transparent manner, and the money is considered to be the rightful property of the distributors
Some distributors use the funds for their personal use while others divide the funds between other parties such as the PKK, community health posts, and village heads
With only 34-66 beneficiary households for each secondary distribution point, distributors and others involved at the local level have obtained excess funds of around Rp53,000-118,000 in each distribution
This is not only a case of the inefficient use of funds, it is a moral issue
Irrespective of the amount of funds involved, poor households are subsidizing to distributors, who are generally not poor
The emergence of the inefficient and/or misuse of the Raskin budget, be it sourced from the APBN, APBD, or the community, are a result of various factors, including the fact that the Raskin program is not fully funded by the central government, that is, the cost of distributing Raskin rice from the distribution point to beneficiaries is not covered
The Raskin General Guidelines indeed spell out that regional governments are responsible for distributing Raskin from the distribution points to the beneficiaries
On one hand, the central government has not seriously issued an imperative policy that is able to force regional governments to provide funds to support the implementation of Raskin
On the other hand, most officials at both the provincial and district level treat the Raskin program as they do other central government projects
This means that their involvement in the Raskin program depends on the provision of operational funding
Considering that the Raskin program is a central program, there is a tendency among local government to expect that all costs incurred as a result of the program are the full responsibility of the central government
2.3 Monitoring, Evaluation, and Complaints Handling
According to the 2007 General Guidelines, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is part of program control and aims to review and evaluate Raskin's implementational effectiveness based on the 6T performance indicators
As one aspect of M&E, the community can convey complaints, criticisms, and suggestions for improvements regarding the program directly to the UPM or via electronic media
2.3.1 Monitoring and Evaluation Activities
The Raskin program has both internal and external M&E
The central, provincial, and district/city Raskin teams conduct internal M&E, while institutions external to the Raskin team conduct the external M&E at either the request of the Raskin team, at the own initiative of relevant institutions, or at the request of a third party
According to Bulog's 2006 M&E report, internal M&E is conducted in a limited number of sample regions for only one district/city per province
These M&E activities could be better characterized as the handling of general complaints from officials administering the program, while the intended M&E function of detecting and evaluating the program's effectiveness according to the 6T indicators is not optimum
According to the Institute of Empowerment and Development Studies, in Banten province, internal M&E is conducted in stages according to the level of government (2005 71-72)
Anak Bangsa Peduli stated that regional governments periodically conduct monitoring (2006 33, 41)
Hastuti and Maxwell (2003 40-41), Olken (2006 855), and Fillaili et al (2007 100) considered that internal M&E is inclined to focus on financial and administrative aspects
BPKP (2004 21) and IPB (2006 slide 22) stated that monitoring is not yet optimal
According to Brawijaya University, the ineffective monitoring is caused by a lack of concern from stakeholders in the various levels of administration as no one is specifically responsible and no special funds are allocated for program management (2006 135)
According to Tabor and Sawit, however, the Raskin program can have a role in building public capacity to monitor a government service program (2006 61)
It can be seen from the review of several documents that external M&E has indeed been carried out by various institutions, including tertiary institutions, NGO, research institutes, and international organizations
The majority of the activities have focused on the Raskin program's implementational processes by analyzing secondary data and conducting field visits
External M&E looking at the program's impact is extremely limited and has only been done on a macro scale or using national-level secondary data
Since the program has been running, the Central Raskin Team has several times assigned various institutions to conduct M&E
Among them LP3ES, CEFFNAS, and UGM in 1998-1999, 35 private and public tertiary institutions in 2003, and ten tertiary institutions in 2005 and 2006
The field findings show that M&E in the study regions has been conducted by the regional Raskin teams
In addition, the regional and subregional divisions of Bulog have their own M&E teams, but their activities are only focused on the aspects falling under the interests and responsibilities of Bulog, such as payments, distribution timetables, weights, and rice quality
Internal M&E has only been done to the level of subdistrict officials administering Raskin
In West Sumatra, M&E is done in stages according to the level of government by either Bulog or regional government groups
M&E sometimes also encompasses socialization activities
There are no routine M&E activities in East Java as no specific funds are allocated for that purpose
Internal M&E tends to be incidental, done whenever community complaints are received
In Southeast Sulawesi, internal M&E is conducted via a staged reporting mechanism beginning from the lowest level of government in the Southeast Sulawesi regional division and from direct observation in the field
External M&E also varies between the regions
In West Sumatra and East Java, both assisted areas, the university assistance groups conduct M&E, but it is limited
In East Java, external M&E tends to be conducted only at the specific request of Bulog
In Kabupaten Agam, M&E has only been done in 2007, and this was not intensive
Only one day was set aside to visit one district, one subdistrict, and one sample village
In Southeast Sulawesi, external M&E at the community level was only found in one sample village, and only extended to one visit by an NGO in 2007
The results of M&E have provided information about the program's implementation, both casuistic based on field findings and on a macro level based on the analysis of secondary data, as found in the document review and discussed in the main findings
Generally, M&E results provide input for the improvement of the program's design, such as the need for increasing the accuracy of target determination through the change in the program's name from OPK to Raskin, the change of the source of data from BKKBN to BPS, the implementation of village consultative meetings, and the need for program and targeting transparency
Nevertheless, such design improvements have not been fully adopted in the program's implementation
This results in the program's implementation to be not optimum
2.3.2 Auditing System
Audits of the Raskin program are regulated in Law No 15/2004 on Audit of State Financial Management and Accountability and Minister of Finance Regulation on Bulog's Budget which is reissued each year
For example, in Minister of Finance Regulation No 117/PMK.02/2007 in Chapter 8, section 3, article 19 clause (1) states that
The cost of maintaining the rice as defined in article 8 clause (3) and the Raskin program food subsidy as defined in article 11 clause (6) is to be audited by an auditor that is authorized in accordance with the valid stipulation.â€ During the time that Raskin has been running, the auditing institution has changed based on the change in Bulog's legal status from a nondepartmental government institution to a public company (perum)
BPKP (the Financial and Development Supervisory Board) conducted the audits up to 2004, and in 2005 BPK (the State Audit Agency) took over the task
The two organizations have audited different aspects of the program
BPKP focused on aspects of the program's implementation, whereas BPK concentrates on fiscal aspects
The BPKP's report on their audit of the program's 2003 implementation was published in 2004, showing that the national performance of the Food Sector Fuel Subsidy Reduction Compensation Program (Raskin), or PKPS BBM Bidang Pangan (Raskin), reached 78.2% of the ideal of 100%
The overall performance achievement figure is based on the figures for accuracy of household targeting (59.4%), amount of rice (61.42%), and realization of the amount paid by beneficiaries (68.5%)
In addition, the BPKP stated that the distribution transaction documents did not contain sufficient detail, that there were still a number of district/city governments that had not published technical guidelines, and that the actual monitoring of rice distribution was weak
BPKP also stated that the results of the functional monitoring officials' audit had not been followed up, and so deviations in rice distribution had continued in that year's program implementation
The BPK audit of Bulog's rice storage costs (biaya perawatan) for the 2004 financial year was published in 2006 and reported several basic accounting discrepancies
Before the audit, Bulog's claim to the government for rice storage totaled Rp349,980,847,938.02, but after the audit it was revised to Rp248,792,012,813.14, a negative correction of Rp101,188,835,124.88, or 29%
The discrepancy was created as Bulog had included other costs in the storage costs claim, such as
(i) the cost of asset construction and construction management costs that had been included in building maintenance costs
(ii) the cost of wages, and functional, official, and operational allowances, holiday allowances, and the one month's wage bonus in personnel management costs
iii) the inclusion of electricity, water, and telephone expenses for officials' residences, contributions, and the maintenance of their commercial operations warehouses in procurement management expenses
and (iv) the cost of WFP rice, incentives, allowances for the operational team, representative allowances, and official travel for commercial operation, as well as celebratory costs and contributions external to public service obligation (PSO) activities, to operational management costs
The BKP 2004 audit of Perum Bulog and its adherence to legislative regulation and internal controls found several issues related to Raskin's implementation, such as regional governments that are in arrears, the embezzlement of 598 tonnes of rice from the Kabanjahe warehouse worth Rp2.2 billion, and the misuse of the proceeds from Raskin sales of Rp148 million by officials in Bulog's Semarang subregional division
According to the BPK, Bulog has followed up the majority of audit reports in accordance with the findings and recommendations
Follow-up measures have included the creation of guidelines dealing with the procurement of goods and services and informing regional governments with Raskin payments in arrears
2.3.3 Complaint Handling System
Community feedback regarding the program's implementation in the form of complaints, criticisms, or suggestions for improvement can be lodged with the UPM, which is coordinated by the village community empowerment board (BPMD)
According to the General Guidelines, UPMs are established at the provincial and district/city level
The units receive written feedback, telephone feedback, or community members can visit the UPM secretariat
Several documents stated that each province and district/city has a community complaints unit
Nevertheless, communities are not informed about the existence of the service so they are barely functional
PT Daya Makara Universitas Indonesia stated that UPM are still functioning at a minimum as the community is not fully aware that they are in place (2006 99-100)
LP3ES stated that the majority of the community is not aware that they are permitted to lodge complaints (2000 27)
The field findings support the document review findings that each region already has a UPM
In addition, Bulog regional and subregional divisions also provide a complaint facility through a post office box and a free-call telephone service
However, again, as information regarding the services is not provided to the community, the services are hardly functioning
Due to the lack of socialization, the community is largely unaware of the existence of community complaints service, feedback mechanisms, and to where or with whom they should lodge their feedback
On the other hand, the community is generally also reluctant to complain even if there is a problem
According to PT Daya Makara Universitas Indonesia, communities are unconcerned about problems in the Raskin program in their region and some are apathetic to complaints as government programs have a bad stigma (2006 99-100)
The LP3ES report states that the majority of respondents (89%) have never lodged a complaint about program implementation problems (2000 34)
Brawijaya University stated that the community has generally never complained to anyone about the Raskin program (2006 108-109)
If a member of the community does have a complaint, they usually only lodge it with village/kelurahan officials, Raskin rice distributors, or the community leader in the region
Anak Bangsa Peduli stated that the majority of complaints are lodged with the neighborhood heads (ketua RT/RW) (2006 38, 45)
According to Institute of Empowerment and Development, community complaints are redirected to the Raskin official at the RT level (2005 76)
LP3ES reported that complaints are lodged with village heads, distributors, or community leaders (2000 35)
The field study supports these findings generally the community does not file complaints
If they do they lodge them with the distributor or a village/kelurahan official
The complaints that do emerge from the community are generally related to the issues of quality or quantity of rice that the beneficiaries have received, targeting accuracy, and the accuracy of the weight of rice in each sack
Anak Bangsa Peduli reported that complaints from the community are generally regarding rice quality, the packaging, inadequate quotas, and uneven division of allocations (2006 38, 45)
Institute of Empowerment and Development stated that the complaints are generally regarding the quality of Raskin and totals of rice below 20 kg per sack (2005 75-76)
LP3ES stated that the problem dominating complaints is related to the policy regarding rice amounts and targeting accuracy (2000 35)
Almost all complaints are never resolved
Brawijaya University stated that although a small proportion of community members have complained, none have received a response from a village/kelurahan official (2006 109)
LP3ES reported that very few respondents stated that their complaints had been resolved
This is because their complaints were policy-related, usually concerning the amount of rice or targeting accuracy, and as such did not fall under the authority of the village head or local program administrators
According to the field findings, the community is reluctant to complain as they are afraid of a negative impact on the continuation of their status as a Raskin beneficiary
If someone does wish to make a complaint, they would only lodge it with the distributor
A small number of complaints are resolved at the local level, but the majority of complaints which are not resolved are never passed up to a higher level
The complaints that are passed on to a higher level (to a Bulog official) usually only concern rice quality
2.4 Attainment of Results, Level of Satisfaction, and Benefit of the Program
The government has spent quite a large amount of money every year on the Raskin program
Besides that, the program has also involved a number of government agencies from the central level down to the village/kelurahan level
Several institutions outside the program such as research institutes, universities, and NGO have conducted extensive research and evaluation in order to provide feedback for program improvement
With all the resources that have been involved and the efforts that have been made, it is hoped that this program can be implemented properly to the point where attainments are high, where the various parties are satisfied, and where it proves beneficial for beneficiaries
An explanation of the results that the Raskin program has achieved, stakeholder satisfaction with program implementation, and the extent to which the program has proved useful for recipient households is provided below
The explanation is based on the results of the document review, secondary data analyses, and field studies
In the field studies, satisfaction levels and program benefits for recipient households were evaluated during FGDs in the six sample villages
FGD participants were asked to rate their opinions on a scale of 0-10, with 0 indicating the lowest level of satisfaction or benefit and 10 indicating the highest level
FGD participants were divided into two groups by sex, which meant that 12 varying assessments were obtained
2.4.1 Attainment of Results
The objective of the Raskin program, according to the General Guidelines, is to reduce the burden of expenditure on poor households by helping them to fulfill part of their food needs by providing subsidized rice
If a poor household obtains the full quota of 10 kg a month, approximately 25% of their rice needs will be subsidized since on average a household consumes around 40 kg of rice per month
The document review, secondary data analyses and field studies show that so far the Raskin program has not achieved its goal
The main reason being targeting inaccuracy
The number of households to which Raskin rice is distributed is greater than the stipulated figure and it also reaches nonpoor households, meaning that the quota of rice obtained by poor households is far below the stipulated amount
The situation has been made worse by reductions in distribution frequencies, the fact that there are still poor households that are not Raskin beneficiaries, and the high prices at which households have to purchase the rice
For example, the World Bank has stated that on average the value of the Raskin rice subsidy received by beneficiaries is only around 2.1% of per capita expenditure and that most of the subsidy does not reach the right households (2005 3)
It can be concluded from the above description that the Raskin program has been unable to provide any significant assistance for poor members of the community by reducing their household expenditure
If the objective of reducing expenditure has not yet been attained, the Raskin program has likewise not yet made a contribution to poverty reduction
Andalas University stated that although 53.3% of government officials and 42.3% of community figures believe that Raskin has been successful by comparison with other programs, significant results are not yet apparent if the program is viewed from its effectiveness in reduction poverty (2006 3-27)
According to the Institute of Empowerment and Development Studies, Raskin is a Bulog project or core business that prioritizes the distribution of rice, and hence it has not reached its target of poverty reduction (2005 74)
2.4.2 Level of Satisfaction with the Program
Out of all the documents that were reviewed, not one makes mention of a local government that is satisfied with Raskin's implementation
Instead, the documents mentioned local governments that are dissatisfied
According to PT Daya Makara UI, some local governments are apathetic towards Raskin because its achievements are still far from its objectives (2006 84)
LP3ES also reported that there are village officials that were not satisfied with the impact of the program because of its effect on mutual cooperation and creativity among the communities (2000 47)
According to Hastuti and Maxwell, some village heads believed that the Raskin program is not that beneficial for the community (2003 56)
During the field studies, various respondents from the provincial level to the community level expressed the opinion that certain program implementation activities are still weak, particularly those related to socialization to the community, targeting, and the complaints mechanism
One aspect that was positively assessed by a number of parties is the quality of the rice provided
Seeing the reality of program implementation in the field, local government officials had different attitudes towards and perceptions of the Raskin program's existence
On the one hand, there are officials who believe that the program is still needed to help with the provision of food for poor families
On the other hand, there are those who consider that the program is no longer necessary because its effects are not commensurate with the money that has been expended on it
The opinion that the program should not be continued was also found in a number of documents
Hastuti and Maxwell encountered village heads who did not agree with the Raskin program and felt that it would be far better to discontinue it (2003 56)
Institute of Demography stated that some village heads do not agree with the program because it teaches the community to develop a begging mentality (FEUI 2003 40)
LP3ES reported their concern that the community will become dependent on rice assistance and that this will give rise to social jealousy (2000 47)
Conversely, beneficiaries are relatively satisfied with Raskin
Andalas University reports that 95% of respondents are satisfied with the method of service (1999 IV-33, IV-34)
Bojonegoro University reports that the quality of service in the disbursement of Raskin is in the very good category with a community satisfaction index of 82.25 (2006 56)
An analysis of FGDs involving members of beneficiary households shows that women participants on average gave a higher evaluation rating than did men
According to women participants, the price of the rice is the most satisfactory aspect of the Raskin program, while the least satisfactory aspect is the complaints mechanism
According to male participants, the most satisfactory aspect is the method of payment, while the least satisfactory is monitoring (Figure 2)
Discussions in the combined male-female FGDs indicate that the most satisfactory aspects of Raskin implementation are the price level, payment methods, and the distribution system
Even though most beneficiaries pay more than Rp1,000 per kg for the rice, they have no objections and regard the price as appropriate because it is extremely low when compared to the prevailing market price of around Rp4,200 per kg
Especially when they realize that the price they have to pay already includes the cost of transportation from the primary distribution point to the secondary distribution point
Payment methods are considered to be quite satisfactory because it does not constitute a burden on beneficiary households
In fact, beneficiaries could sometimes ask distributors that they be allowed to postpone their payment if they did not have adequate money ready at the time of distribution
Meanwhile, the distribution methods usually adopted by the village officials, hamlet, RW, or RT heads, or PKK office-bearers are also regarded as quite good because they divide the rice fairly and with a suitable measuring system (Figure 2)
The aspects regarded as least satisfactory by the combined FGD participants are the monitoring and complaint systems and the quantity of rice
Participants were not satisfied with monitoring for the simple reason that there have never been any monitoring activities in their areas
They were also not particularly satisfied with the complaint aspect because they were not aware of the existence and mechanism of the complaint system
Dissatisfaction with the amount of rice that was given to beneficiaries stemmed from the fact that it was far less than household requirements
For example, if a family receives the full quota of 10 kg, it would only be sufficient for one week's consumption
2.4.3 Program Benefit for Beneficiary Households
General benefit A number of documents express the opinion that Raskin is useful for beneficiary households because it is able to help reduce their economic burden and help them meet their rice needs while also improving the quantity and quality of household consumption
For example, Hasanuddin University reported that poor members of the community as well as community figures and local governments believed that the Raskin program was very beneficial for poor households by reducing their economic burden (2006 52)
According to Tabor and Sawit, food assistance is able to solve some of the nutrition problems of poor families (2006 12)
Apart from its direct benefits, Raskin also yields indirect benefits such as the creation of employment and assistance with health and educational expenses, while also contributing to price stabilization
Anak Bangsa Peduli reported that some respondents believed that Raskin was beneficial because it created labor-intensive work for other people such as those employed in transportation and in loading and unloading of the rice (2006 40)
LP3ES reported that although the transfer of income from the Raskin program is small, it enables beneficiaries to save money for things such as health and educational expenses (2000 55)
Tabor and Sawit stated that Raskin can maintain stability in rice prices (2006 45)
Field studies revealed that stakeholders at provincial, district and subdistrict levels have diverse assessments of Raskin's benefit for poor households
Some stakeholders say that it helps those members of the community who cannot afford to meet their food needs, while others believe that as a program Raskin is not educating because it spoils poor households
Recipient households, however, find the program beneficial, even though the amount of rice that they receive is not sufficient and the quality is sometimes poor
Information obtained through FGDs shows that all participants feel that Raskin is beneficial for poor households
The amount and the type of Raskin benefits mentioned by FGD participants differed a little from region to region
FGDs in Kabupaten Agam named eight benefits, whereas in Bojonegoro and Kolaka participants mentioned only four
Of all the various benefits described in FGDs, only three were consistently mentioned by participants in all locations
help with food expenses, a reduction in a family's economic burden and worries, and assistance with educational expenses (Table 21)
With Raskin, beneficiaries can reduce the money spent on foods, which means a reduction in the family's economic burden and in its associated worries
Less expenditure on food creates additional income that is used, among other things, to pay for educational requirements, to help with social activities like arisan, and to make possible the acceptance of social invitations
In the specific case of FGDs in West Sumatra, recipients also mentioned other Raskin benefits, namely, the prevention of price fluctuations, the raising of enthusiasm because of government attention to the economically weak members of the communities, and assistance in eradicating poverty
Income transfers One of the benefits of Raskin is that it represents an income transfer in the form of rice from the Raskin program to recipient households
In very simple terms, beneficiaries obtain an income transfer or a financial subsidy of an amount that depends on the quantity and distribution frequency of rice, as well as the relative price differences between Raskin rice and rice in the local market
Tabor and Sawit state that in 1998/1999, Raskin transferred Rp3.4 trillion to 9.3 million households or the equivalent of Rp365,590 per year or Rp30,466 per month per household (2006 109)
According to LP3ES, the income transfer to recipients in September 1999 was only Rp15,357 (2000 55)
Tabor and Sawit also reported that in 2002-2004, based on the assumption that there were 13.2 million recipient households and that the value of total transfer benefits was Rp3.25 trillion per year, recipient households obtained an income transfer that averaged Rp20,500 per month (2006 45)
Theoretically, the total Raskin income transfer per month to recipient households in 2007 was the equivalent of 10 kg multiplied by the difference between the price of rice in the local market and the price of Raskin rice (officially Rp1,000 per kg)
At the time when field studies were carried out, medium-quality rice (equal in quality to Bulog rice) in the sample areas was around Rp4,200 per kg
This means that Raskin beneficiaries would have been given a subsidy equal to Rp32,000 per month or Rp384,000 per year
In reality, beneficiaries in the sample areas did not receive a subsidy of this size, both because the quantity of rice and the frequency of distribution were less than what had been stipulated and because the price that they paid was greater than Rp1,000 per kg
In the sample region of West Sumatra, beneficiaries obtained 8-10 kg per month or in a small number of cases every two months, but at a price of between Rp1,200 and Rp1,300 per kg
In East Java, the Raskin rice price was Rp1,000 per kg, but beneficiaries received only 4 to 7 kg per month
In Southeast Sulawesi beneficiaries received rice only 3 to 9 times during 2007
On each occasion they were given between 4 and 10 kg at a price of Rp1,000 to Rp1,200 per liter
In a situation of this kind, the income transfer to households that received Raskin rice in the sample areas ranged from Rp12,800 to Rp29,000 per distribution or from Rp38,400 to Rp348,000 per year (Table 22)
Access to rice The benefit of Raskin rice for the community in terms of access to rice is relatively small because rice is always available at the community level
In all locations rice can be obtained both from local harvests in the area itself or from other places from where it is brought to the study areas by local traders
Moreover, rice constitutes such a basic requirement for the community that meeting this need is a top priority
If the household budget is limited, members of the community will still try to buy rice by reducing their purchase of other necessities
III LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RASKIN
The document review, data analysis, and field visits revealed the presence of both good and bad features in Raskin implementation
Based on implementation practices, several positive and also a number of negative lessons can be drawn that can be used to improve program implementation
3.1 Positive Lessons
The following positive lessons can be drawn from practices in the implementation of Raskin
a. Targeting accuracy is highly dependent on the level of commitment and roles of the regional government and implementers at the local level, socialization which stresses that Raskin rice is only for the poor households, the use of BPS data that has been verified at the local level, and the transparency of the list of beneficiaries
b. Price accuracy is dependent on whether or not rice is distributed directly to recipients from (primary) distribution points, the distance between the (primary) distribution point and the beneficiaries, and the size of the contribution from the APBD
3.2 Negative Lessons
The negative lessons that warrant attention in the implementation of Raskin are as follows
a. The shortfall in the total allocation compared to the total number of RTM has caused targeting inaccuracies as well as inaccuracies in the amount of rice distributed to beneficiaries and distribution frequency
b. Targeting inaccuracy is influenced by weak socialization, community indifference, the lack of commitment from regional governments, and the shortfall in total rice allocation compared to the total number of RTM
c. The regional government's lack of commitment is influenced by their saturation with the already long-running program which has become routine, program implementation that does not reflect the objectives, and weak socialization
d. Price inaccuracy is influenced by whether or not rice is distributed from the primary distribution point or a secondary distribution point, and how far it is from household beneficiaries
e. Distribution delays are caused by outstanding payments from the distribution points
f. Distribution delays affect the community's readiness to allocate the time and prepare the funds for the purchase of the rice
g. The accuracy of distribution frequency and amount of rice that beneficiaries receive is not always a good indication of successful program implementation
Distribution frequency may be correct every month, but the amount of rice received may be below the stipulated amount, or vice versa
IV RECOMMENDATIONS
The Raskin program which has been running for nine years has used a significant amount of funds and involved many parties, but it is still not performing effectively
Therefore, Raskin should only be continued if the following conditions are met
a. The program must be revitalized
This can be done by implementing a guided national information campaign (socialization) to increase the awareness and real understanding of the program's essence for all stakeholders, including local implementing agencies and the community
These socialization activities must be clearly regulated in Raskin's General Guidelines
b. The allocation for beneficiary households at the national level must be firmly stipulated and appropriate for the total number of households in the targeted group
The target household category must be clearly defined, including whether it is limited to very poor households only or is to include poor or near poor households
c. One institution must oversee those responsible for the distribution of rice starting from procurement right down to distribution to the community in order to clarify the respective tasks, responsibilities, and how performance will be evaluated
d. Local governments must be responsible for dividing the allocation and ensuring accurate targeting of beneficiaries
To ensure accurate targeting, regional governments should verify the BPS data on RTM or other data which is used to determine targets at the national level
e. The maximum number of beneficiary households determined by verification at the village/kelurahan level must correspond to the total allocation the village has obtained in order to guarantee that the amount of rice for each household is as it should be according to the stipulations
The subdistrict should be responsible for formally approving and validating the list of targeted households
f. Arrangements must be made for (primary) distribution points to ensure that beneficiaries do not pay more than the stipulated rate
g. A policy is needed to force regional governments to seriously support Raskin's implementation, through both providing funding support (through the APBD) and helping to achieve the program objectives
h. An incentive and penalty system should be introduced and implemented to ensure that the program is implemented in accordance with the guidelines
A reward should be given to regions or program implementers that successfully implement the program in line with the regulations, based on a set of predetermined indicators
Incentives could be in the form of an award
While penalties could take the form of media announcements identifying unsuccessful regions, or the dismissal, transfer of duties, or demotion of the implementing officials
i. A serious, planned, and accountable practice of monitoring and evaluation activities by independent and credible external institutions will help to guarantee the appropriate implementation of Raskin and will support the incentive and penalty system
The results of monitoring activities must be widely presented to various parties including the public and systematically used for the improvement of the program's implementation
j. All stipulations regarding the program's implementation, such as those concerning socialization, targeting (verification and data reference), and monitoring and evaluation must be clearly regulated in the program's guidelines
If those conditions are not met, Raskin should be ended and an in-depth study on the following aspects is required
a. the impact of Raskin's phase out on the food security of poor households
b. the transfer of Raskin funds to poverty reduction programs that will provide better assistance for poor households
c. Bulog's role in the procurement and stabilization of the national price of rice, as currently more than 80% of the rice procured by Bulog has been distributed through the Raskin program
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
We wish to acknowledge the contribution to this study of the people of Buyut, the Village Head and his staff, the Camat of Cirebon Utara and staff, the Cirebon Regional Planning Board (Bappeda), the Industry and Trade Office in Kabupaten Cirebon, the staff and management of several rattan enterprises, and the Indonesian Furniture Manufacture's Association (Asmindo)
INTRODUCTION 
Towards the end of year 2000, a group of researchers from SMERU conducted a study of small-scale rural credit in a number of villages traditionally associated with wetrice cultivation in the Cirebon area of West Java
In one of these villages, Buyut in Kecamatan Cirebon Utara, our team was struck by the relatively dynamic economic environment evident within the local community
Throughout the day there was little or no evidence of young people chatting idly with nothing to do, a common indication of unemployment in many other village communities throughout Java
Every morning a number of vehicles collected large numbers of young men and women from the village, returning with them again in the evening from their work in the rattan industry
Some of those returning home were carrying rattan from their places of employment, apparently as models for making additional items in their own homes
At the same time, in many houses throughout the village, many of the occupants - old and young, male and female - were busily occupied with rattan work
It was apparent that in Buyut, and possibly in other villages nearby, the rattan industry had become a mainstay of those people looking to obtain additional income outside the parameters of the traditional agricultural economy
Fieldwork for this study was carried out in September 2001
The research team observed and recorded a significant part of the economic activities of the village community in Buyut, and especially those associated with the rattan industry
The study set out to concentrate on the following three areas
to examine the impact of economic activities in other villages in the surrounding area on the economic life of Buyut; to assess the impact of non-farm economic pursuits on agricultural activities; and to consider briefly the influence of these non-farm economic activities on the wider dimensions of economic and social life in the village
Information was collected from a wide range of sources during fieldwork
In addition to interviews with members of the local community involved in the entire range of economic activities evident within the village, valuable insights were also gathered from interviews with rattan factory staff and managers, local sub-contractors, workers at all levels of the rattan industry, industry association representatives, and government officials from various agencies
DESA BUYUT
AN OVERVIEW 
The village of Buyut is located in the west of Kecamatan Cirebon Utara (see attached map)
It is approximately 15km from the important port city of Cirebon from where it can be reached in approximately 30 minutes by public mini-bus (angkot)
Buyut is part of the northern coastal agricultural region known as the Pantura, 
and has the most extensive area of agricultural land in Kecamatan Cirebon Utara
Approximately 103 ha of its total 153.5 ha of arable land consist of rice paddies watered by a variety of methods of irrigation
48 ha are serviced by a technical system, 31 ha use a semi-technical system, and the remaining 24 ha employ simple irrigation methods
However, some areas of rice land are less productive because the irrigation systems have not been well maintained and the permanent water sources are located some distance away
Consequently, there is frequent flooding in the wet season, while during the dry season a large proportion of the rice paddies are without water and cannot be used for other crops
The rice fields in Buyut can only be planted twice a year at most
During the wet season, which usually begins between October and December, farmers generally plant their main rice crop
In the dry season, the area under crops is usually far more restricted
the types of crops planted varies and includes rice, secondary crops (primarily corn) and other food crops such as green and yellow cucumbers, watermelons and tomatoes
In general, the pattern of farming in Buyut is as follows
Usually, the farmers of Buyut do not sell their agricultural produce immediately after the harvest
Instead, following the traditional system which has been handed down through the generations, it is stored and sold gradually according to their need for cash
Elsewhere in Central and East Java the majority of farmers no longer apply this method, preferring the tebasan system where their rice crops are sold while still in the field before the harvest
In Buyut, the tradition of selling agricultural produce over a gradual period helps farmers to obtain a better price, because during the main harvest (around March or April) the price of unhusked rice tends to fall
Most farmers usually sell the bulk of their rice two months before or two months after the main harvest
However, there are also some farmers who are forced to sell just after the harvest, primarily because they require capital for the next planting season
Like other regions along the north coast of Java, Buyut is often plagued by mice and inundated by floods
Consequently farmers cannot always rely on the produce from their rice paddies
Over the last two years, the rice harvests in the village have failed
According to the head of one farmer group, the 1998-1999 harvest failed because the rice crop was infested by pests that stunted the growth of the rice seedlings, resulting in no significant yield
Some in the village believe that the pest infestation arose because rice farmers failed to plant the recommended rice varieties uniformly throughout the area
Local agricultural officials or extension workers usually recommend the Digul and IR-64 varieties, but sometimes farmers plant Cisadane since it is the preferred variety in the market and can fetch a higher price
According to local statistics collected in 1999, Buyut's total population was 5,399 or 1,282 families
Of the 1,767 people officially listed as employed in the village, 534 (or 30%) are farm laborers, 527 (29%) are farmers, 423 (25%) are employed in the private sector mostly in the rattan industry, 166 (9.4%) are government employees or pensioned civil servants, 74 (4.18%) are entrepreneurs, and the remainder work in a trade or in the service sector
This official data on sources of income is, however, not strictly accurate because groups such as housewives and students, who often work in the rattan industry on a part-time basis, tend to be classified as unemployed
In addition, although no definite figures are available, an obvious shift in employment patterns is presently occurring throughout the village, since there is a strong tendency among those working in the agricultural sector to shift to the rattan industry
This trend was evident in interviews with local informants who described the limited opportunities for work as farm laborers and the advantages of working in the rattan factories
Almost all the inhabitants of Buyut are involved in some type of income-generating activity, no matter how limited in scope
Young people in the village admit to a sense of shame and embarrassment if they are unemployed
Besides those who cultivate their own land or those who work as farm laborers, many others in Buyut are employed in the rattan industry, both in the rattan factories or with rattan factory sub-contractors
Other economic activities are varied and include those who own (a few numbers) or work in rice mills or tea factories and those working as unskilled labor overseas
A number of individuals produce foodstuffs for sale; others make paving blocks, bricks or wooden furniture
Many others have opened small street stalls selling a wide variety of simple household goods, basic farm supplies or foodstuffs
A few earn a living as building and construction laborers, motor vehicle or becak drivers, welders and hairdressers
It is apparent that the majority of those who work in small-scale enterprises or as manual laborers receive relatively small incomes
This situation is a reflection of the generally low level of education within the local community where 41% have only completed primary school graduates, of the remainder 32% are (junior high school graduates), while only 20% have graduated from senior high school
NON FARMING ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES
RATTAN 
Employment in the rattan industry among the people of can be divided into the following three categories
those workers who are employed in the rattan industry outside the village, especially in neighboring kecamatan; those operating as rattan sub-contractors within the village; and the employees of these sub-contractors
1 The Rattan Industry 
Rattan enterprises throughout Kabupaten Cirebon originated from the home industries that were first established in the village of Tegalwangi, Kecamatan Weru
The variety of goods originally produced was quite limited and based on simple designs, for example rattan sleeping mats
During the 1970s, however, these small enterprises began to attract the attention of various outside organizations, including the Department of Industry, the Directorate General of Cooperatives, Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), the Indonesian Credit Association, non-government organizations such as the Research and Community Development Institute (LPPM) and the Institute of Research, Education, and Economic and Social Information (LP3ES), as well as the Department of Fine Arts at the Bandung Institute of Technology, and the West German Assistance Institute (FNS)
Several of these organizations carried out research and began to provide support to develop rattan cottage industries in Tegalwangi, 
providing technical assistance for the emerging small-scale enterprises and training for their prospective workers, as well as financing loans for prospective entrepreneurs
It was anticipated that the technical assistance would not only provide the skills required for the entrepreneurs to access the market, but also result in new designs for international exports, in particular new types of furniture
Many entrepreneurs have been producing rattan furniture since that period, and rattan products from Cirebon began to be exported after 1974
While previously rattan cottage industries only existed in Tegalwangi, they eventually began to emerge in other locations, including villages outside Kecamatan Weru
At present, the major centers for the rattan industry in Cirebon are to be found in Kecamatan Weru, Kecamatan Plumbon, and Kecamatan Cirebon Barat
In all these areas this industry has successfully absorbed workers from many villages in the surrounding hinterland
According to Hafid Setiadi, et al (2001), the rattan enterprises in Tegalwangi still employ 30% of all rattan workers throughout Kabupaten Cirebon
During the 1980s, the rattan cottage industries in Tegalwangi developed rapidly with the establishment of several relatively large-scale rattan factories, which drew on both local capital and funds from outside the area to cover start-up costs
This rapid growth was largely stimulated by government policies prohibiting the export of all forms of unprocessed rattan
During the 1990s, foreign investors from Europe, America, and Asia (for example Taiwan and the Philippines) began to take an interest in the rattan industry in Kabupaten Cirebon
Large-scale rattan factories were built to produce goods for the export market employing hundreds of workers
Before construction of the factories was complete, the investors were already contracting out work to rattan craftsmen based in the surrounding villages
The total number of rattan enterprises small, medium and large-scale has increased in number from year to year
According to data provided by the Kabupaten Cirebon Office of Industry and Trade, there were 828 such enterprises in 1996
By the year 2000 this had increased to 909 enterprises, officially employing 50,644 workers, with a total investment of Rp102 billion
Meanwhile, the production capacity of these enterprises had reached 604,000 tons, valued at Rp839 billion
Almost all of these rattan products (93%) were intended for the export market
The growth of the rattan industry has also led to a significant increase in the volume of exports
Table 2 indicates that the volume of rattan exports in 1996 totaled 11,837 containers
By the year 2000 this had increased to 14,370 containers (valued at US$119 million), an average annual increase of 5.35%
The destination of the exports includes countries throughout Asia, Europe, America, and Africa as well as Australia 
Even though the rattan industry in Kabupaten Cirebon has grown significantly, it is still endeavoring to overcome a number of problems
Of primary concern is the lack of patents on designs that are often duplicated by competitors
For example, a single popular design is often reproduced by more than 20 different factories
According to the Indonesian Furniture Manufacturers Association, before the expansion of the rattan industry, entrepreneurs and designers did not anticipate the problem of plagiarism
To help overcome this problem, a team has recently been formed to organize the registration of patents on new designs
Other problems for rattan enterprises include fluctuations in the price of raw materials and the difficulties in obtaining particular types of rattan
2 Rattan Sub-contractors and Their Operations 
Rattan sub-contractors are small-scale entrepreneurs who make rattan products according to orders that they receive from the large rattan factories
The work is performed outside of the factories placing the orders, usually in the subcontractors workshops or the homes of their workers
The factories provide models or prototypes of the design to be replicated, the raw materials required (although these may be sometimes sourced by the sub-contractors themselves), and carry out quality inspections of the completed products
The sub-contractors then deliver completed orders to the factories for the finishing process
This work is always carried out in the large factories and includes stripping, sanding and lacquering, as well as the packing of the products for export
Sub-contractors are paid by the factories in accordance with the determined contract rate per unit, otherwise known as a piece-rate
Those who establish themselves as sub-contractors have usually worked in rattan factories for between 5 and 15 years before setting up their own workshops
Subcontracting is attractive for several reasons
The large factories have always encouraged enterprising individuals to open their own businesses, and there is the potential to earn a higher income than can be achieved working as employees of the factories
In the village of Buyut, rattan sub-contract work began around 1988
Factory owners considered it advantageous to contract out a percentage of their production to avoid the large amounts of capital required for the expansion of their factories, and to minimize the co-ordination of large numbers of workers
As a result, the number of sub-contractors began to increase in the villages near the large factories
This included Buyut, which is located only about four kilometers from the main production center in Tegalwangi
There are now about 15 sub-contracting businesses in Buyut employing between 400 and 600 workers
On average, they each employ between 6-12 male workers in their workshops and around 25 female workers who operate from their own homes
Apart from receiving an income that is calculated on a piece-work basis, those employed in the workshops of sub-contractors are usually provided with lunch, drinks, as well as extra food whenever they are required to work overtime
Those women who work from home are paid according to the amount of work that they manage to complete
The initial capital required by a sub-contractor to establish a business currently ranges between Rp7 million and Rp25 million, depending on the size of the operation
This does not include costs associated with locating and establishing the site for the workshop
One important element in this establishment phase is a substantial cash flow so that sub-contractors are able to pay their workers prior to receiving their first payments from the rattan factories
The start-up capital required is often borrowed from the factories or from other investors
In order to avoid any lull in their business, sub-contractors normally try to secure orders from other factories through cooperative arrangements with other sub-contractors who have more work than they can manage
Sub-contracting work is generally carried out in the following stages
Sorting and choosing rattan raw materials in accordance with the product model provided by the factory
This includes determining the size of the rattan required, and is usually carried out by the sub-contractor himself or a trusted representative; Cutting and heating the rattan, making it easier to shape in accordance with the required design
This work is usually undertaken by the male workers in the subcontractors workshops; Constructing the frame, which is also always carried out by the male workers in the workshops; Binding of the frame, usually performed by female workers in their homes; and Plaiting the rattan to complete each item, also the task of the female workers in their homes
By dividing the work into several stages, all workers are included in a sub-contracting enterprise's activities, creating a teamwork environment of codependency
Any delay on the part of one worker will impede the entire work process
For example, delays in the construction of the bound frame of a product will cause delays at the plaiting stage, ultimately reducing everyone's potential income
3 Employment in the Rattan Factories 
Approximately 500 members of the Buyut community, especially the young men and women, work in rattan factories in the surrounding area
In many cases, several members of the same family are engaged in this work
Information about employment opportunities are usually obtained through neighbors, friends or members of the family who are already working in a factory
Workers usually travel to and from work by vehicles provided by the factories
Each day, approximately ten trucks leave the village every morning, each with up to 50 workers
In general, rattan factory workers fall into one of three categories, monthly workers, daily hire workers, and those who are employed under piece-work arrangements
Only those workers in the first two categories are regarded as permanent employees
Those employed as permanent monthly workers receive their wages each month, whereas the daily hire workers and piece-workers receive their wages weekly, paid every Saturday
They work an eight-hour day from Monday to Friday with an additional half day on Saturdays
Wages vary according to the difficulty of the work performed and the number of pieces produced
However, there is little variation in the wages paid by different factories for work of the same nature
For example, those working in the design section (cutting the rattan, making the frames for items of furniture, and constructing the models) can receive an income of between Rp100,000 and Rp250,000 per week
In comparison, those in the plaiting, sanding, and packing sections receive somewhere between Rp25,000 and 120,000 per week, depending again on the complexity of the task and the total output
Apart from their base wages, the factories provide various other benefits for their workers
These include transport to and from work, and a Lebaran Bonus (in the form of cash and clothes paid at the end of the annual fasting month) which is paid to all permanent and non-permanent workers
For permanent employees, several factories also provide other services, including additional bonuses, social security contributions (Jamsostek), protective clothing and uniforms, as well as covering workers medical expenses when they are ill
4 Employment in Rattan Sub-contracting Enterprises 
Those workers who are employed by rattan industry sub-contractors appear to enjoy a number of additional benefits compared to those who work in the large factories
Since the sub-contractors workshops are located close to their homes, these workers are able to spend more time with their families
In addition, food is usually provided for extra hours and workers are able to regulate their own hours, deciding when to take breaks, and deciding how much overtime they wish to take on because working hours are not strictly governed
However, the continuity of work is less reliable because this depends on the sub-contractors orders from the factories
Consequently, sub-contractors are not always able to guarantee regular daily employment for their workers which can have a significant effect on income levels
The relative advantages and disadvantages of working with sub-contractors tends to depend on the particular workers involved
Apart from the men employed in the subcontractors own workshops, there are also many housewives and students whose primary interests lie outside of their employment in the industry
Students often work after school or at night, usually by doing binding or platting work, and often to assist their parents who may also be employed by the same sub-contractor
The wages received by those employed by sub-contractors vary considerably and are determined by the amount of work completed and the type of product that is being produced
Platting work usually pays between Rp4,000 and Rp6,000 for a simple model, although for a more complex piece workers can earn up to Rp11,500
A platting worker usually receives somewhere between Rp12,500 and Rp25,000 per day
If the rattan work only involves binding, women working from home receive between Rp2,500 and Rp12,500 per day
Overall, workers incomes vary widely and can range anywhere between Rp25,000 and Rp100,000 per week
Those undertaking more difficult tasks, such as making the frames for items of furniture, may earn up to Rp200,000 per week
The level of education of workers employed by sub-contractors varies between those who have only finished primary school, to those senior high school graduates
However, education levels, especially for those who have worked for a significant time in the industry, appears to have no significant influence on wage levels
OTHER NON-FARM ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES 
1 Joining Indonesia's Official Overseas Labor Contingent (TKI)
One alternative to working in the agricultural sector is to enlist as a member of Indonesia's official overseas labor contingent
In the village of Buyut there are currently about 20-30 women
who are working overseas in Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Singapore
As a result of their minimal level of education these women have only been able to find placements as housemaids
A number of young girls from Buyut have chosen to become overseas workers in the expectation of receiving a large salary and accumulating a significant amount of money in a reasonably short time
For example, one overseas worker who worked in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for two years (1998-1999) was able to return with around Rp30 million, after expenses had been taken into account
Another woman who worked in Madinah for one and a half years was able to return with around Rp16 million
It would be impossible to receive incomes as large as these working locally, including in the rattan industry
From the capital that overseas workers are able to save, most are able to build a new house or transform the original simple bamboo structures into permanent houses
At the very least they are able to equip their houses with a range of consumer items and electronic appliances
Yet despite the perceived advantages, the level of interest in Indonesia's official overseas labor scheme remains limited because of the widely reported risks involved and the two year contract period involved
2 Brick Making 
Bricks are only produced during the dry season, from around August through to October
Unplanted rice-paddies with elevated grounds are exploited for the purpose
The owners of these paddy fields deliberately set aside these areas for the brickmakers so that they can use the top soil and consequently lower the level of the paddy, making it easier to irrigate and ensuring that the paddies are not used as a breeding ground for mice
Approximately 50 individuals in Buyut operate small-scale brick-making enterprises
They work on adjacent plots of land, each occupying around 0.3 ha, either working alone or with assistance from their families
None of them use additional paid labor
No special contract is drawn up between the land owners and the brick makers
Usually, the land owners receive 500-1000 bricks as a form of payment
Each brick maker can produce around 10,000-15,000 bricks in a season (each season is about one and a half to two months depending on when the rains begin)
Red bricks are sold on location for Rp140 per piece
When these individuals are not making bricks, they return to their routine activities, which include working as farm laborers, share farmers or becak drivers
3 Petty Retail Activities (Warung) 
In even the most remote parts of Buyut, there is always at least one small stall (known as a warung) to be found selling basic everyday goods, snacks and other precooked foods
The number of these small petty retailing enterprises in the village has increased rapidly, paralleling the increase in the number of workers in the rattan industry, 
and there are now over 100 of these small stalls, all primarily operated by local women
The daily turnover of these stalls ranges between Rp40,000 and Rp300,000 gross or Rp6,000-Rp40,000 net, depending on the size of the business
Turnover increases significantly every Saturday and Sunday after the rattan workers have received their wages
4 Tea Factory Workers 
A small number of individuals in Buyut, mostly young women, work in the tea factories located in Kabupaten Cirebon
They are met and taken to and from work every morning and afternoon in a vehicle provided by the factories
Their income at the tea factories is relatively small, only around Rp5,000-Rp7,000 per day
By working from Monday through Saturday, they can obtain between Rp30,000 and Rp42,000 per week
Despite the low income, these women continue to work in these tea enterprises, reportedly because the work is not too strenuous
5 Other Activities 
Other economic activities observed in the village include the making of telur asin (cured/salted eggs) and lontong (steamed rice wrapped in a banana leaf)
It seems that such work produces substantial financial rewards
One family - a husband and wife and their two children - produces approximately 1,000 telur asin and 1,000 lontong every day to sell at the market in the city of Cirebon
Each telur asin sells for Rp750, making a profit of Rp75, 
and each lontong for Rp200, with a profit of Rp85
Another lontong maker produces 3,000 pieces every day, for a 100% return on the capital investment required
In addition, there are several individuals who make and sell kue serabi (a kind of rice flour pancake)
They generally have a daily turnover of around Rp25,000, which provides them with a clear profit of approximately Rp6,000
Another has a small syrup enterprise, employing six workers while there are also some who work as construction laborers, becak drivers, and welders
THE IMPACT OF NON-FARMING ACTIVITIES ON THE FARMING SECTOR 
The large number of Buyut's inhabitants who are now working outside the farming sector - primarily in the rattan industry - has had a significant effect on the availability of agricultural laborers in the village
Fewer and fewer younger members of the community are willing to work in the farming sector, leaving older people to carry out the farming work
The economic crisis, which caused the rattan enterprises to boom, tended to draw young people in particular away from farming activities and absorb them into the rattan industry
Male farm laborers, who previously only received Rp12,000 per day, since the year 2000 have had their wages increased to Rp20,000 for a full working day (from 7.00am to 4.30pm), or Rp15,000 for a half day
Apart from cash wages, farm laborers also receive food, snacks and cigarettes to the value of Rp5,000
Despite this increase, the youth of the village continue to express little interest in working in the farming sector, preferring to work in the rattan industry
These young men offer various reasons for this shift in their choice of preferred economic activities
working as an agricultural laborer is perceived by some to be dirty and demeaning, reducing a person's sense of self-respect; farm work is highly seasonal; agricultural labor is also hard and exhausting work that leaves little energy for any other income earning activities; employment in the rattan industry potentially offers a higher level of income, especially for those with the appropriate skills; and the rattan industry also offers opportunities to access credit when this is needed as workers are able to borrow money from their sub-contractor employers before pay-day
The decline in the availability of labor in the sector has not only caused farm laborers wages to increase; it has also forced farmers to rely increasingly on tractors rather than manual labor
The manual labor that is still carried out by the local village people is limited to the harvest periods, the construction of dikes (work performed by men, 
while women carry out the planting and fertilizing of paddies
For these types of work they received around Rp10,000-Rp12,000 per half day
The combination of labor shortage and high farming costs has resulted in some local landowners, particularly those with large tracts of land, to lease their paddies to share farmers
Rice paddies leased over a single cropping period returns between Rp800,000 and Rp1 million per ha, while a double cropping period brings between Rp1,2 million and Rp1,5 million per ha
By leasing out their rice paddies, these landowners no longer have to concern themselves with finding the capital required to pay wages, and to purchase expensive fertilizers and pesticides
Nor do they have to face the risks of rice prices falling or their crops failing as a result of pest infestation or flooding
Working in the farming sector is considered far less financially reliable than working in the rattan industry
Nevertheless, most farmers with small plots of land continue to manage their paddies themselves
In order to provide for their daily needs, these farmers make use of their spare time away from the rice fields also working in rattan sub-contracting enterprises, by petty trading, or by working as becak drivers or laborers
Meanwhile, the share farmers who lease rice paddies are generally older members of the local community who are accustomed to working as farmers
They are able to survive in the farming sector because they perform almost all the work themselves or are assisted by their families
Consequently, they do not need to spend money on employing additional laborers
Besides working in the rice paddies, they also have second jobs such as making bricks or driving becak
Besides the increased availability of work outside the farming sector, the shortage of agricultural labor and the high costs of farming have also led to a decline in the area of land devoted to farming in Buyut
The majority of farming land is now only used for crops once a year during the wet season
Meanwhile, in the dry season, although crops could still be planted, there are few landowners who are interested
This is because during the dry season the land must be attended to far more regularly and far more manual labor is required because there is no available supplies of irrigated water
THE IMPACT OF NON-FARMING ACTIVITIES ON SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN BUYUT 
According to local informants, the rattan industry began to have a strong influence in the village around 1986, when a few people from Buyut started working in a rattan factory in a neighboring village
Nowadays, there are more than ten large factories employing workers from Buyut
Subsequently, a number of these workers were encouraged by the factory owners who were employing them to establish rattan subcontracting enterprises in their own village
There are now more than 15 such enterprises in Buyut employing a large number of others
The rattan industry, both the large factories and the smaller sub-contracting enterprises, have brought considerable financial benefits to the residents of Buyut
Almost all young people of working age in the village are able to find employment in the rattan industry
School children and housewives can also find part-time work in sub-contracting enterprises
As a result, the drift to the large urban centers, especially by young people, and the incidence of social conflict and petty crime has all declined
According to several informants, petty theft was quite a common phenomenon in the village before the rattan industry began to provide a stable source of employment for the local community
In addition, rattan sub-contractors have assisted the people of Buyut with several community development programs in the village
These have focused in particular on cleaning up the environment, Independence Day celebrations, the construction of water storage facilities and a mosque, as well as the formation of a residents village security body
The expansion of the rattan industry has had other positive repercussions for the people of Buyut
By increasing the purchasing power of the local community, a range of small-scale petty trading enterprises such as small shops and stalls (warung) have been able to flourish
For example, one local petty trader who sells a popular kind of soup in the village can use up to 20kg of meat in a single day
Several small traders describe Saturday and Sunday as their especially busy days because that is when many of the rattan workers receive their wages
One vendor specializing in grilled chicken who operates a stall on the edge of the village is able to sell approximately 25 chickens every Saturday and Sunday
Buyut's village head admits that the existence of the rattan industry has had a substantial impact on the local community both in direct and indirect ways
For example, other small-scale enterprises like brick making have also benefited from the increasing number of residents who are now building permanent houses
Previously, the walls of rattan workers houses were made only of woven bamboo
Nowadays, however, many of them own permanent houses made of bricks and cement 
or they have used some of the income earned in the rattan industry to cover other costs, for example, purchasing wood and roof-tiles
As far as educational attainment is concerned, the expansion of the rattan industry has had two quite different effects upon the attitude toward education within the village community
On the one hand, it has discouraged some teenagers from continuing to higher levels because students realize that they can drop out of school and still be guaranteed a steady income
On the other hand, many individuals working in the rattan industry parents, grandparents, older brothers and sisters  are now earning sufficient income to support their children or younger siblings and are actively urging them to remain at school to pursue their education at a higher level
CONCLUSION
The rapid expansion of the rattan industry from the late 1980s in several centers of production in Kabupaten Cirebon, especially in Tegalwangi, has had a substantial effect on employment and the economic life of the surrounding villages
Buyut, a village only four kilometers from Tegalwangi, is a prime example of these developments
A majority of its inhabitants – old and young, men and women – now receive at least a significant proportion of their income in the rattan industry, either as regular employees in one of the large factories, or as workers in one of the many sub-contracting workshops that have sprung up in the area, most of them owned by small entrepreneurs from the village
Housewives and students have also been absorbed into the industry as part-time piece-workers for these sub-contractors
Another prominent section of the village population is involved in a wide range of other economic pursuits also outside of the agricultural sector
These include those who are working as petty traders selling a variety of produce and household goods (and some providing supplies and equipment for the farming community), and in food stalls, brick-making enterprises, and as migrant workers, wholesale food producers, drivers, tea factory workers, and in rice mills
Nevertheless, the rattan industry remains the single most important source of income for the people of Buyut
The growing importance of the rattan industry on the economic life of the community has had a substantial impact on agriculture in Buyut, a village where 67% of its land area consists of wet-rice fields
Although the largest single group within the village still claims farming or farm labor as their source of livelihood, in reality there is a growing tendency for this to be the preserve of the older members of the village community
The younger generation is now reluctant to participate in agricultural labor
As a result, there has been a significant reduction in available labor for agriculture, causing farm wages to increase 
In the end, this condition contributes to a general decline in agricultural activity within the village
The significant number of those who have been absorbed into the rattan industry has also had a significant flow-on effect to other areas of economic life within the Buyut community, as purchasing power has risen and other areas of the local economy have experienced a positive benefit
One clear sign of this has been the growth in the number of thriving stalls and small petty enterprises that have expanded their operations in the last few years throughout the village
There are indications that the expansion of the rattan industry has had some positive impact on communal life within the village
This is reflected on the fact that almost everyone within the community is able to find gainful employment and a guaranteed source of income
As a result, community leaders believe that there has been a reduction in some of the social problems such as petty crime and the drift of young people away from the village to the large cities that has been observed among other rural and semi-rural communities throughout Java
ABSTRACT
The government of Indonesia has started the implementation of locally based healthfinancing schemes based on health insurance principles
This scheme is commonly known as JPK-GAKIN, which is a health-financing scheme through which the poor can access health care in public facilities, including primary and secondary health care
Due to the perceived success of JPK-GAKIN pilots, the government has decided to provide JPK-GAKIN in all districts in Indonesia from January 1, 2005
This study looks at the effects of different characteristics of JPK-GAKIN program on healthcare service provision, utilization of health care services, quality of healthcare provision, and how insurance characteristics can influence the relationships between stakeholders
Three districts were selected for the case studies
Purbalingga (Central Java), Tabanan (Bali) and East Sumba (Nusa Tenggara Timur)
We found that compared with previous health financing schemes, JPK-GAKIN scheme has achieved better results in providing access to adequate health care coverage to members of the population, especially the poor
However, we found several problems associated with the scheme, such as there is a need to improve its targeting and efficiency, it needs stricter financial monitoring and auditing, and it needs to increase stakeholders involvement in the governance of the scheme
We will elaborate on these concerns and recommend possible policy options to resolve them in this paper

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Government of Indonesia (GoI) has designated a number of districts as pilot areas to implement locally based health-financing schemes based on health insurance principles (Jaminan Pemeliharaan Kesehatan (JPK))
This scheme is commonly known as JPK-Gakin (JPK untuk Keluarga Miskin)
JPK-Gakin is a health-financing scheme through which the poor can access public health care through primary and secondary health care facilities
The pilot JPK-Gakin project started in 15 districts and two provinces in Indonesia, and was later expanded to additional regions in the following year
Originally, JPK-Gakin was managed by Bapel (Badan Pengelola Management Unit), an independent body separate from the Regional Health Agency (DinKes Dinas Kesehatan) that often consists partially of officials who were working for the DinKes prior to the establishment of the Bapel
Due to the perceived success of JPK-Gakin, however, the GoI has decided to provide JPK-Gakin in all districts in Indonesia from 1 January 2005
This time, JPK-Gakin has to be provided by PT Askes, which will run it as a government monopoly, in compliance with the newly passed Law No 40 of 2004 on the National Social Security System
This has been done despite the concerns of some regional officials that PT Askes has not been successful in delivering good quality health benefits for its primary clientele, the Indonesian civil service
This study aims to investigate the effects of different characteristics of the JPK-Gakin program on healthcare service provision, utilization of health care services, quality of healthcare provision, and how insurance characteristics can influence the relationships between stakeholders
Three districts were selected for the case studies
Purbalingga (Central Java), Tabanan (Bali) and East Sumba (Nusa Tenggara Timur)
We selected each of these districts for a specific reason
Purbalingga was the very first district to initiate health insurance coverage for the poor in 2001
Purbalingga's scheme aims to extend the coverage of insured people in the region not just to the poor, but eventually to its entire population, although non-poor participants will pay a premium depending on their income
Tabanan provides a scheme through PT Askes and is also a second-generation JPK-Gakin pilot area, 
thus this its program can also highlight initial experiences with the provision of health insurance for the poor
East Sumba is one district that has a very high poverty rate and thus the provision of health insurance can have a major influence on increasing access to health care for the poor
It is also a district that experiences many problems with distance as the population is spread over a wide area
Compared with previous health financing schemes promoted in Indonesia such as the JPS-BK scheme, the JPK-Gakin scheme has achieved better results in providing access to adequate health care coverage to members of the population, especially the poor
One of the reasons why it has achieved better results than previous schemes is the fact that JPK-Gakin is fully administered by local governments (the funding is shared between central and local government budgets)
Because it is locally administered, it is easier for the government to develop innovations within the scheme, dealing with problems and members complaints, and taking into account local conditions that might affect health care delivery in a particular region
The JPK-Gakin scheme needs to be improved in several ways, however, in order to enhance its effectiveness, improve its efficiency, and increase the quality of services received by its beneficiaries/clients
There are several problems that need to be immediately addressed by the DinKes, Bapel and health providers so they do not hinder the effectiveness of JPK-Gakin in delivering its service to its members/clients
These include the following
There seems to be a lack of efficiency in the management of JPK-Gakin funds by health providers (especially at RSUD)
Claims were approved with little verification and inspection to ensure that they were accurate and there are indications that most of the funds were used to subsidize the care of non-poor patients rather than the poor ones who were supposed to benefit
There appear to be a number of formal and informal barriers whose effect is to discourage some Gakin members from using the services to which they are entitled
These barriers include high transportation costs, the delay in the distribution of their membership card, etc
Such barriers might discourage the poor from using JPK-Gakin services and could make many JPK-Gakin members reluctant to seek treatment in public facilities
The low utilization rate of JPK-Gakin members using the services they are entitled to results in the misallocation of Gakin subsidies to the supposedly betteroff members, who can actually afford to pay some of their own health care costs
It is likely that most of these funds were used instead to upgrade the buildings and medical equipment of the hospital and to subsidize other hospital patients, especially those from the upper income brackets
For instance, in Purbalingga it is estimated that 79% of the JPK-Gakin funds subsidize the health care services of non-poor patients at puskesmas and at the local public hospital (RSUD) with 87.63% of overall JPK-Gakin funds going to non-poor patients
It was also found that the unit cost per patient for each JPK-Gakin member treated at hospital in these districts is quite high, ranging from Rp480,505 in East Sumba to Rp7,122,559 in Purbalingga
It is inconceivable that the patient's costs reflected in this calculation were all expended on the treatment of JPK-Gakin members 
It is quite possible that a significant proportion of funds were leaked and resulted in the treatment of non-poor patients in these hospitals
In order for the JPK-Gakin scheme to become truly pro-poor, this misallocation needs to be addressed
There is little involvement by non-government stakeholders, in particular, JPK-Gakin members/clients, in the design, implementation and monitoring of the scheme
JPK-Gakin members are just passive clients
Because they do not participate in the scheme's decision-making processes, the management of the program is less transparent and accountable to its stakeholders, especially its members
With the exception of East Sumba, there is no involvement by private health providers in the provision of health services for JPK-Gakin members
They are only able to seek health services in publicly managed health facilities (puskesmas and RSUD)
The fact that most private providers do not participate in the scheme results in a more limited choice of health providers available for its members, and, therefore, in restricted access to better quality services
The choice of insurance manager/carrier is also becoming more limited, with the creation of the PT Askes monopoly to manage the JPK-Gakin scheme
The decision was made by the Ministry of Health (MoH) without advanced consultation with local governments, Bapels and other stakeholders, 
creating tension between the MoH, PT Askes and these stakeholders that could potentially create disincentives between them to cooperate and coordinate JPKGakin operations
JPK-Gakin funding largely depends on subsidies from the fuel subsidy compensation (PKPS-BBM/Program Kompensasi Pengurangan Subsidi Bahan Bakar Minyak) scheme and from the general block grant (Dana Alokasi Umum - DAU) given by the central government to district/local governments that largely funds the local government budget (APBD)
Funding from other sources (e.g member's premiums) only forms a small part of the program's overall funds
In the long run, this might make the scheme unsustainable as PKPS-BBM and DAU grants are reduced, creating potential disruptions in the delivery of services
Other than the required quarterly financial reports, there is little monitoring done by the Bapel and DinKes on the use of JPK-Gakin funds by providers
Thus, it is not known whether all the reimbursement claims made by the providers are made for services actually provided
This could provide the opportunity to misuse the funds through the submission of fraudulent claims
Coordination between related government agencies (DinKes, Bapel and health providers) could be improved further
While in these three districts there are efforts to coordinate the operation of the JPK-Gakin scheme, the outcome has not yet been optimized 
and turf-battles and finger-pointing between these agencies are still common when problems arise
To address these problems and to make the JPK-Gakin scheme work better, the following steps are recommended for implementation by the government, Bapel, health providers and other stakeholders
We target these recommendations at the local governments that manage and implement the JPK-Gakin scheme, along with the central government (Ministry of Health) that will supervise and provide policy advice to the local implementers
We have divided these recommendations into short, medium and long-term recommendations, based on our assessment of how long it would take to implement them
Most of these recommendations should be implemented by local governments, after consultation with the central government, the private sector, NGOs, and most importantly, their citizens, who are the beneficiaries of the JPK-Gakin scheme
Short-term recommendations (implemented within the next one to two years)
Increase coordination between different government agencies, especially between DinKes and PT Askes in managing JPK-Gakin delivery at the local level
Create clear guidelines on the functions, duties and responsibilities of each government agency in administering the JPK-Gakin scheme at the local level
With such guidelines, the functions of each agency would be clarified and turfbattles between them could be avoided
Eliminate formal and informal barriers for Gakin families to use the services to which they are entitled
The government also needs to eliminate the misallocation of Gakin subsidies to higher income groups, to ensure that the JPKGakin scheme truly meets its intended purpose of providing health financing for poor families
Improve the efficiency of health services delivery by health providers (puskesmas and RSUD)
Health services given to JPK-Gakin members should be appropriate to their needs and should be medically necessary
Stricter monitoring procedures should be introduced to ensure that Gakin funds are used as efficiently as possible and that all expended funds are actually accounted for
Improve the quality of services provided by puskesmas
Many citizens perceive puskesmas as providing poor quality services, 
and thus, they are not willing to seek primary health care treatment there
Incentives to improve the quality of health service delivery at puskesmas should be introduced
At the same time, however, puskesmas should not use such incentives to increase their salaries or to pay out cash bonuses to puskesmas staff
Improve socialization/marketing techniques to recruit new JPK-Gakin members, using low-cost mass-marketing tools that would have wide credibility among prospective clients
Kaders (health cadres) might be a potential tool for such socialization purposes
Incentives could be created to make kaders more productive in recruiting new members
This could include regular honorariums for kaders that are higher than the current financial incentives available to them
Medium-term recommendations (implemented within one to two years)
Reactivate puskesmas activities at village level (especially in remote districts), for instance, through reintroducing mobile health clinics (puskesmas keliling) or by training village level health providers (such as alternative healers or dukun) so that they can provide first-aid medical assistance to villagers, help doctors and other health practitioners at puskesmas who are travelling on puskesmas keliling, and to give referrals to puskesmas in cases where they are unable to treat the patients due to the seriousness of the patient's medical condition
By undertaking these tasks, it is hoped that access to health facilities at the village level can be improved and that citizens do not have to seek treatment at puskesmas unless their conditions cannot be treated at the village level
Provide stricter monitoring (both internal and external) to ensure that the JPKGakin funds allocated to provide health services at RSUD and puskesmas are spent effectively and efficiently
The monitoring should be done both by Bapel (or Bawasda/The District Auditing Board) and also by an independent monitoring unit that could be set up by an NGO/CSO, by the community or by a JPK-Gakin members association
Implement measures to increase JPK-Gakin members participation in the planning, implementation and monitoring of the scheme
The members should be allowed a voice in the decision-making process affecting their welfare and their membership in the JPK-Gakin scheme
The creation of a JPK-Gakin members association at grassroots level might be the first step to achieving this goal
Consider including private providers (e.g private doctors, private hospitals and health clinics) in the list of providers of the JPK-Gakin scheme
This would increase the choice of providers for members of the scheme and would improve their access to needed health services
In order to attract private providers into the scheme, higher reimbursement payments set close to the market rate might be necessary so that the payment is in line with the rate charged by private providers
This might however, require premium increases that might force some JPK-Gakin members to drop out of the scheme because they could no longer afford the premium
Consider ending the PT Askes monopoly as the insurance carrier for the JPKGakin scheme and open the selection of insurance carrier to a competitive bidding process done by each local government
These companies would run the financial management, claims and reimbursement of the Gakin funds in each region, while local governments (DinKes) would continue to issue appropriate regulations and monitor how the program is operated
All insurance companies (both state and privately owned) should be allowed to participate in this bidding process and given a chance to manage the JPK-Gakin scheme based on their previous achievements and their ability to serve its clients efficiently
Long-term recommendations (implemented in three or more years)
Efforts need to be taken to reduce or eliminate the dependency of the JPK-Gakin scheme on the PKPS-BBM and APBD-DAU grants to make it self-financing through premiums or other contributions from members/clients, either through increasing premiums for better-off non-Gakin members or by introducing new taxes to fund the scheme (e.g introducing local cigarette and liquor taxes)
Of course, efforts need to be taken to ensure that this measure does not reduce members access to essential health services they need and would not be disruptive of local economic activity nor affect the local labor market
Consider charging a minimum premium rate (or co-insurance) for JPK-Gakin members, since it seems that paying Gakin members are more likely to demand better services from the providers than non-paying ones and are more likely to complain when these services are not delivered to their satisfaction
Of course, the charges imposed on Gakin members should be set at an appropriate minimal level so that they do not drop out of the JPK-Gakin scheme altogether due to affordability issues
This has been done in the Rembang District where Gakin members are required to pay a premium of Rp5,000/person/year to receive their program benefits
It was quite successful; 
since the poor pay a small portion of their premium, they are more inclined to monitor the service quality of their health services and to complain if they think they receive unsatisfactory treatment
Carefully study the possibility of introducing a health voucher scheme, in which poor citizens would directly control the health subsidies given to them
This is done to minimize possible leakages of the subsidy to higher income patients and to promote accountability and improved service quality, since voucher holders could choose any health providers they feel would provide the best services available to them (both public and private providers would be allowed to treat voucher holders), so there would be competition between providers to attract the most voucher holders to their facilities
Of course, leakages could also occur in a voucher scheme if poor voucher holders sold their vouchers to those on higher incomes
Therefore steps should be taken to minimize this possibility (such as recording the names of voucher holders and assigning them a unique identification number)
I INTRODUCTION 
The Government of Indonesia (GoI) has promoted programs on health care financing for the poor based on the notion that good health is one of the basic rights of all citizens
There is limited access to health care by the poor who, for a number of reasons, have much lower rates of utilization of health care services than the rich
The GoI has introduced a number of policies to increase access to, and utilization of, health care services
In 1998, the GoI introduced the Social Safety Net for the Health Sector Program (JPS-BK) to increase access to health care services for the poor through community healthcare centers (puskesmas) and village midwives (bidan desa)
Under this program, poor citizens received a card with which they were eligible for free health care services from public primary health service providers
In 2001, the GoI introduced additional subsidies aimed at health care services for the poor through the energy subsidies program (Penanggulangan Dampak Pengurangan Subsidi Energi Bidang Kesehatan)
In 2002, this program was renamed the oil subsidies program (Program Kompensasi Pengurangan Subsidi Bahan Bakar Minyak) but the nature of the program stayed the same
The health card program was implemented to increase access to health care services for the poor but it experienced many problems with identification of the poor, the distribution of the health card, additional administration burdens on health care providers, and, in particular, the financial governance of the government
Thus, access to health care services, especially for the poor, is still very limited
Due to the limitations of the health card program the GoI looked for a more effective, efficient and sustainable financing mechanism
After the 2001 program of administrative decentralization, the central government designated a number of districts as pilot areas to implement locally based healthfinancing schemes based on health insurance principles (Jaminan Pemeliharaan Kesehatan (JPK))
This scheme is commonly known as JPK-Gakin (JPK untuk Keluarga Miskin)
JPK-Gakin is a health-financing scheme through which the poor can access health care in public facilities, including primary and secondary health care
Through the use of insurance principles, the problem of administration overload of the puskesmas would be solved and cost-containment made possible
The pilot JPK-Gakin project started in 15 districts and two provinces in Indonesia, and was expanded to additional regions the following year
These locally based schemes do contain many significant differences
For example, the provision of JPK-Gakin was, until the end of 2004, not limited to one specific health insurance provider and as a result health insurers with different backgrounds provide health insurance in different districts
Three of the main differences include the benefit package, the insurer and the reimbursement system
In most districts, JPK-Gakin is managed by Bapel (Badan Pengelola Management Unit), an independent body separate from the Regional Health Agency (DinKes Dinas Kesehatan) that often consists partially of officials who were working for the DinKes prior to the establishment of the Bapel
In some other cases JPK-Gakin is provided by PT Askes, which is a state-owned health insurance enterprise established by the Ministry of Health in 1968, which has an independent board of directors but is under the supervision of the Health Ministry
PT Askes is a for-profit state-owned company that provides a number of different benefit packages in Indonesia
Benefit packages (including those for the poor) provided by PT Askes are nationally set, so districts do not have the authority to make changes to accommodate local needs
Due to the success of JPK-Gakin, the GoI decided in November 2004 to provide JPKGakin in all districts in Indonesia, however, a number of adaptations were made with the pilot projects
The main change is that from 1 January 2005, through a decree of the Minister of Health (Decree No 1241/MENKES/SK/XI/2004), JPK-Gakin has to be provided by PT Askes, which will run it as a government monopoly, in compliance with the newly passed Law No 40/2004 of the National Social Security System
This policy change was made without consultation with local governments implementing the JPK-Gakin scheme and other related stakeholders, 
who were only informed about it after the decision was finalized
Of course, local governments were not happy about this new policy, as they felt that PT Askes had not been successful in delivering good quality health benefits to its primary clientele, the Indonesian civil service, and they claimed that the JPK-Gakin scheme managed by local governments provided better benefit packages than PT Askes
Since the decision has become final, however, they could not do anything to reverse it
Currently, several districts in East Nusa Tenggara, East Indonesia, have started to implement the law and other regions in Indonesia will soon follow suit
In this study we aim to look at the effects of these different characteristics of the program on healthcare service provision, utilization of health care services, quality of healthcare provision, and how insurance characteristics can influence the relationships between stakeholders
Some districts have managed to implement and continue the scheme relatively well
Why have some districts been more successful in implementing the JPK-Gakin program than other districts
What are the barriers to better service delivery for the poor
What factors influence significant improvements in these services
What are some possible policy alternatives to make the JPK-Gakin scheme work better for its members
II DISTRICTS INFORMATION 
Three districts were selected for the case studies; Purbalingga (Central Java), Tabanan (Bali) and East Sumba (Nusa Tenggara Timur)
Each of these districts was selected for a specific reason
Purbalingga was the very first district to initiate health insurance coverage for the poor in 2001
The Purbalingga government has aimed to extend the coverage of insured people in the region not just to the poor, but eventually to its entire population, although non-poor participants will pay a premium depending on their income
Tabanan provides its scheme through PT Askes
Tabanan is also a second-generation JPK-Gakin pilot area that was introduced in 2004
Its program can also highlight initial experiences with the provision of health insurance for the poor
The third case study, East Sumba, is one district that has a very high poverty rate and thus the provision of health insurance can have a major influence increasing access to health care for the poor
East Sumba is also a district that experiences many problems with distance as the population is spread over a wide area
The table below shows differences between the benefit package and provision of the health insurance schemes
III METHODOLOGY 
Information for this study was obtained from in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with related informants in the three districts mentioned above
Informants included officials of the district Health Agency (Dinas Kesehatan-DinKes), the district scheme managers (Badan Penyelenggara-Bapel), puskesmas staff (puskesmas head, doctors and other support staff), district hospital (Rumah Sakit Umum Daerah- RSUD) staff (head, doctors and other support staff), village officials, village midwives (bidan desa), village volunteers (kaders), and patients/clients who enrolled in the JPKGakin scheme in these districts
The interviews were conducted in fieldwork conducted throughout the months of December 2004 and January 2005
In addition to these interviews, we also collected relevant documents regarding the JPK-Gakin schemes operating in these districts, such as any relevant district-level laws and regulations, financial reports, patient visitation reports at the RSUD and puskesmas, and so forth
We were able to obtain all of these documents in Purbalingga and East Sumba districts
In Tabanan district, however, we were only able to obtain some of the regulations and patient visitation reports and no financial reports
IV FINDINGS 
A OVERVIEW 
Based on our study in the three JPK-Gakin pilot districts (Purbalingga, Tabanan and East Sumba), we found that, in comparison with previous health financing schemes such as the JPS-BK scheme, the JPK-Gakin scheme has achieved better results in providing access to adequate health care coverage to district residents, especially the poor
One of the reasons for this is the fact that JPK-Gakin is fully administered by local governments (the funding is shared between the central and local government budgets)
Because it is locally administered, it is easier for the government to develop innovations within the scheme, deal with problems and members complaints as well as take into account local conditions that might affect health care delivery in a particular region
Each of the three districts we visited has a different financing mechanism and administration
Purbalingga chose to have an insurance scheme in which members are divided into three groups
Strata I for the poor, Strata II for the formerly or near poor, and Strata III are for the well-off citizens of the district
The premium for Strata I is fully paid by the government, while the premium for Strata II and III are paid by the members, either partially (Strata II) or fully (Strata III)
It is expected that within the next decade the Purbalingga scheme could be self-financing, with Strata II and III premiums subsidizing Strata I
However, at this time it is the other way around, with Gakin (Strata I) members subsidizing the other two groups that are better-off (Stratas II and III), 
see section d for further details
Tabanan, a second-generation JPK-Gakin district, decided to contract out the management of its JPK-Gakin scheme to PT Askes, a state-owned company specializing in providing health insurance for Indonesian civil servants
Tabanan assigned responsibility to PT Askes as the insurer of JPK-Gakin because it wants to avoid the risk of failure that can cause serious financial problems and because PT Askes is seen as a professional institution that has the required length of experience in managing insurance schemes as well as a wide coverage area
The benefit package offered for the JPK-Gakin participants is similar to the one provided to civil servants
East Sumba in the East Nusa Tenggara province, was able to provide a JPK-Gakin scheme even though it is one of the poorest districts in Indonesia with about three quarters of its population living below the poverty line
From 1 January 2005, the insurance management was split between PT Askes, who will manage the health care financing for the urban population, and the East Sumba Health Agency (Dinas Kesehatan-DinKes), which continues to manage health care financing for the rural population
Since JPK-Gakin schemes are fully managed by the districts themselves, they can be flexible in administering the program and dealing with local situations that might inhibit health care delivery in their respective regions
For instance, East Sumba has provided a transportation allowance for JPK-Gakin members living in remote areas, since they often have to travel a great distance to seek health treatment
The allowance helps them to offset the transportation cost to and from health facilities so that the cost of transportation does not discourage them from seeking health care
There are also indications that Gakin members are more likely to express their complaints or dissatisfaction about how the program is being administered to the local government's DinKes or Bapel offices than was the case when the health scheme was still managed by the central government
Since local governments are perceived to be closer to their citizens, people have more confidence that they will get a response to their complaints from local governments, compared with lodging a complaint with a central authority in Jakarta
Thus, Gakin members are more likely to file a complaint with the local government, increasing their voice in how the JPKGakin scheme is administered
As described later in this section, however, this does not mean that local citizens were more involved in the design and implementation of JPK-Gakin compared with previous schemes, since it was also found that they continue to be excluded from the policy deliberation process
B THE INSURED 
After a process of identification, all the poor are automatically enrolled into the JPKGakin program
The districts have different poverty levels, the poverty rate at the national level is around 16%
East Sumba has high levels of poverty, whereas Tabanan has only a very small proportion of poor people
In Purbalingga 57,362 people have been identified as eligible for free health insurance, 
this equates to about 28% of the total population
In addition, there are 42,533 Strata II and 23,408 Strata III members, who pay premiums to access the health services, either in part (Strata II) or in full (Strata III)
As a result, almost 60% of the population in Purbalingga in total is insured via the benefit package of the Bapel
Of this number, however, only about 28% were classified as poor
In East Sumba as many as 129,074 people were classified as being poor
This varies widely from the number identified by the central government (81,200)
After the first round of identification and verification, the second identification round in 2004 identified a total of 159,037 people who had income levels below the poverty line
This does not mean that people's income over that period decreased dramatically, but is the result of a different and (according to the Bapel and other stakeholders) improved identification process
As the central government only officially funds the 81,200 people it recognizes as poor, PT Askes will provide health insurance for that number of people, whereas Bapel will manage the JPKGakin program for those other poor recognized by the second identification round
Based upon 2003 data from Statistics Indonesia, the total population in the region was 198,940 people, thus around 66.5% of the population in Kabupaten Sumba Timur is identified as being poor
Kabupaten Tabanan in Bali is a relatively wealthy district with a lower poverty rate than the national average
In 2004, only 10,710 gakin households or 37,791 persons were identified
This is about 9% of the district population
The benefit packages differ between districts and the size of the package has a large influence on the usability of the package for the poor
The packages provided to the poor participants (Gakin) in Purbalingga and East Sumba are very complete without limitations, ceilings or co-payments but exclude some very expensive, but infrequent treatments
The PT Askes provided packages in Tabanan are, however, more limited due to the introduction of ceilings and co-payments
The premium in Purbalingga is relatively low; set at Rp50,000/family per year, thus equaling approximately Rp12,500/person per year, whereas the premiums in East Sumba and Tabanan are set at Rp60,000/person/year
Table 2 shows the number of poor citizens (Gakin) who are members of the insurance scheme, along with the percentage of the district population that is considered to be poor
C FINANCING AND REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM 
It should be noted that the JPK-Gakin scheme, while claiming to be a health insurance scheme, is not a scheme based on real insurance principles
Instead, it is a financial transfer scheme that is supposed to channel funds from wealthier citizens to the poorer ones through the intermediary of the government, 
however, as will be detailed later, even this transfer scheme does not work as it was intended
All three districts use a capitation system for primary health care providers
In both Tabanan and East Sumba, hospitals are reimbursed through a fee-for-service system, but the Dinas Kesehatan in Purbalingga has decided to make a capitation payment to the hospital to improve cost-containment
Over the past few years, however, the capitation payment for the RSUD has doubled as the capitation set in previous years proved to be insufficient
Hospital management are reluctant to predict whether this years capitation will be enough
They expect that this year's expenditure will be closer to the capitation payment, but this will not reduce the deficit they accumulated over previous years
Typically, the DinKes and the Bapel set the capitation level once a year, when the terms of the JPK-Gakin scheme are reviewed
These two reimbursement methods can largely influence the incentives of health care providers to perform their duties diligently
A capitation payment can have a large influence on cost-containment, the risk lies with the health care provider who has to give good quality care for a defined budget
This can have a negative impact on quality of services
On the other hand, fee-for-service does not have this limitation and thus does not give an incentive for the provider to contain costs and/or services
As a result health care expenditures can increase significantly, which results in increased pressure on (in this case) the government budget
One observation we can make of the schemes in these districts is that there seems to be a lack of efficiency in the use of JPK-Gakin funds by health providers (especially at RSUD)
While the payment system is supposed to be largely operating on a capitation basis, in practice, health providers (both puskesmas and hospitals) charge for their services on a FFS (fee-for-service) basis
Bapel paid virtually all of the providers claims and it is not clear whether they have verified the claims carefully before approving them
As long as the payment system is operating de-facto as a FFS, cost control would not be achieved and the use of appropriate health services/treatments might be discouraged in favor of more expensive ones that might not be absolutely necessary for patients (e.g., using patented rather than generic drugs)
Another concern for us is that JPK-Gakin funding in the districts that have piloted it (including in the three districts used for this study) largely depends on subsidies from the fuel subsidy compensation (PKPS-BBM) scheme and from the general block grant (Dana Alokasi Umum DAU) given by central government to district/local governments, which largely funds the local government budget (APBD)
On average, over 80% of JPK-Gakin funding comes from these two sources
Funding from member's premiums and other local tax revenues (Pendapatan Asli Daerah - PAD) only form a small part of the program's total funding
If this funding pattern continues, it is feared that in the long run, funding for JPKGakin could be cut as the amount of PKPS-BBM and DAU grants to these districts is reduced
As these grants are reduced, service delivery for JPK-Gakin patients could be compromised as well
It is suggested that local governments should start planning alternative financing means to make the JPK-Gakin scheme self-financed and less dependent on the above two grants, either by requiring Gakin participants to make a financial contribution into the scheme, or through other local taxes that would not cause disruptions to the welfare of citizens and businesses alike (for instance, by taxing alcoholic beverages and cigarettes)
In all the three districts surveyed, primary care providers (puskesmas) are reimbursed through capitation payments
Puskesmas capitation funds are used to pay for the treatment of poor outpatients
Expenses for in-patient care and small operations are reimbursed on a FFS basis instead of being covered by capitation funds
The costs at the puskesmas are so much lower than private doctors and hospitals because the services provided at the puskesmas are first of all much cheaper than those provided at the hospital, but a second more important reason is that the puskesmas services are already highly subsidized
The puskesmas in all districts already receive subsidies from central, provincial and district governments for the expenditures of the puskesmas
Puskesmas have different financial resources, the major ones are the following
1 District government budget (APBD II); most of these funds (more than 80%) come from the central government's general block grant (Dana Alokasi Umum-DAU); 
2 puskesmas income from user's fees; 
3 JPK-Gakin capitation payments; and 
4 claims on PT Askes for the treatment of Askes members (normally civil servants)
Looking at the financing of the puskesmas it becomes obvious that the funds from JPK-Gakin are more than enough to finance the health services of the poor
In fact, they have unspent monies that cannot be used for other than health service provision for the poor as these are tied funds
Sometimes the puskesmas have ideas on how to use the money to improve the quality of the puskesmas services, but they could not use the unspent portion of the JPK-Gakin subsidy to finance such improvements, since it would be in breach of the scheme's regulations
On the other hand, the hospitals we visited have to struggle to cover their costs
A few of them have a large deficit
For instance, the Tabanan hospital has a deficit of Rp780 million
This is despite the fact that in fiscal year 2003, only 0.3% of Gakin citizens eligible to receive free treatment at the hospital actually visited it (113 people out of 37,791 eligible Gakins)
In the same fiscal year, the hospital received Rp1.8 billion to treat Gakin patients
Since the hospital is still running deficits, it is most likely that this subsidy was not used efficiently to treat those targeted for the subsidy
It is likely that it was used to upgrade the buildings and medical equipment of the hospital and to subsidize other hospital patients, especially those coming from upper income brackets
The hospital was not audited by the local government (either DinKes or other entities), since it was an independent (but quasi-public) entity
Its financial reports were sent directly to PT Askes and PT Askes declined to make them public
These observations show that there is evidence that the JPK-Gakin funds were not used efficiently, were often leaked to non-poor patients, and were not carefully monitored and audited by appropriate authorities
We will elaborate on these in the next section
D GAKIN UTILIZATION
IS THE FUND DISTRIBUTION PRO-POOR
Utilization data shows how many members of a health-financing scheme actually use the services it provides
It gives us a clue on whether or not the financing scheme was used mostly to fund the health care of its members
It also tells us how confident are members of the health financing scheme in the quality of services it provides and, hence, their willingness to use it
A high utilization rate shows that the scheme is mostly used by its members and that they have a high level of confidence in it and are therefore willing to use it
On the other hand, a low utilization rate means that the scheme's members do not have much confidence in it and decline to use it
In this case, it is more likely that the funds allocated by the scheme are used to benefit non-members
Our study indicates that the actual utilization rate of JPK-Gakin members who actually obtain health services from the selected health providers is still quite low (especially at hospitals), 
as illustrated in Table 3 below
This low utilization rate shows that members of the JPK-Gakin scheme were reluctant to use it, even though local officials have told them that they will get free treatment at the selected health facilities
Based on our analyses, the low utilization rate of JPK-Gakin members could be attributed to the following
The cost of transportation for poor citizens (gakin) from their homes to the puskesmas
Even when they receive free treatment at the puskesmas, they have to pay for their transportation costs themselves, since it could not be reimbursed by JPK-Gakin
The transportation cost is much higher than the puskesmas user charges (and with JPKGakin, these charges were waived)
A one-way trip to a puskesmas could cost Rp10,000, while the treatment itself costs nothing for the Gakin
Thus, there is an additional cost in attending the puskesmas that discourages some Gakin members from seeking treatment at puskesmas
Some Gakin members have not received their JPK-Gakin membership card, discouraging them from seeking treatment at puskesmas since they were afraid that they would be denied treatment if they do not have the new card
In fact, in Purbalingga we observed that premium paying members of the insurance scheme tend to obtain their membership card more quickly than the non-paying Gakin members, 
indicating that services are better if one actually pays for it rather than if it is freely available
There is a common perception within the community that the quality of health services in puskesmas and public hospitals (RSUD) is poor and that the staff of these facilities do not treat patients courteously
As a result, some Gakin members interviewed stated that they prefer to use private providers, such as traditional healers, private doctors etc
Such services are, however, not reimbursable under the JPK-Gakin scheme, which only covers services provided by governmentowned facilities such as puskesmas and RSUD
Thus, if one wants to get the best health care from the providers they trust the most, their choice would be very limited under JPK-Gakin
Many Gakin members choose not to use the scheme altogether and continue to use the service of private providers even when they charge high consultation fees, since they have more confidence in these private providers that they will get the best health services available to them
The low utilization rate of Gakin members also indicates that most of the JPK-Gakin funds allocated to puskesmas and RSUD were actually not used to fund the health services of poor families, but instead were used to subsidize the health care of other customers of these facilities who are financially better-off
One example of this could be seen in Purbalingga
In Table 4 below, we can see that the monthly utilization rate of the Gakin members of the district's insurance scheme (JPKM) were the following
Table 5 shows that while Gakin members received more than 57% of the JPKM funds allocated by the district government, they only use about 21% of the puskesmas health services and 12.37% of the services offered by the local public hospital (RSUD)
This indicates that most of the JPK-Gakin funds allocated in the Purbalingga district were not used to fund health services of poor persons living in the district, but instead were used to subsidize other operational costs of the puskesmas and RSUD, specifically subsidizing other users of these facilities who are better-off financially than Gakin members (i.e the premium-paying members of the JPKM insurance scheme)
Finally, when we calculated the unit cost per JPK-Gakin user in the two districts for which we have financial data (East Sumba and Purbalingga), we found that the average cost of treatment for each JPK-Gakin patient in these districts is quite high, especially at hospital level
As we can see from Table 6 below, it costs Rp7,122,559 to treat each Gakin patient in RSUD Purbalingga and Rp480,505 to treat each Gakin patient in the East Sumba hospitals (RSUD East Sumba and the Lindimara hospitals)
It is inconceivable that the patient's costs reflected in this calculation all went to treat JPK-Gakin members, 
thus, it is possible that a significant portion of funds were leaked for the treatment of non-poor patients in these hospitals
Indeed, the hospitals said that the Gakin subsidies allocated by the Bapel were fully absorbed by them and yet, both of them are almost running financial deficits
It could be assumed, therefore, that most Gakin funds were used to subsidize other hospital operations rather than the servicing of Gakin patients
In other words, despite the goal of JPK-Gakin to help poor Indonesians receive the health care they need, the distribution of the JPK-Gakin subsidy is pro-rich rather than pro-poor
This might not be the most efficient way to provide health coverage for poor citizens, since most of its intended targets never use these services and those that actually use them might actually be able to fund most, if not all of their own health expenditures
If the JPK-Gakin scheme were to be called truly pro-poor, the trend of subsidizing the health care of the non-poor at the expense of the poor has to be reversed, 
but doing so would require a major change in the way the JPK-Gakin scheme is organized and operated
This issue will be addressed in our policy recommendation section
E MEMBERS IDENTIFICATION AND SOCIALIZATION 
In a normal insurance situation people will acquire insurance by themselves if they are interested
In the case of JPK-Gakin, however, the premium for members is automatically paid by a third party (the government) so health insurance is, effectively, a free service for them
This does not necessarily mean that those people eligible to the service will instantly present themselves to the insurance provider
There is a need to identify people eligible for the program and make them aware of the benefits of the program so that they comply and avail themselves of their rights
Since the insurance package has been pre-paid by a third party, there is no financial incentive for the insurer to perform this function or to do it well
At the same time, members do not have an adequate incentive to find out more about their rights under the insurance scheme
Because the JPK-Gakin scheme is fully administered by local governments, each district has the task of identifying the poor
In the three districts visited the DinKes has assumed this responsibility
In general, all three districts make use of the vertical structure of the DinKes (puskesmas staff, village head and bidan desa)
From our field observations, however, we concluded that without additional help at the village level an accurate identification of the poor is very difficult
Each Dinas Kesehatan should, therefore, make use of village informants for this purpose
There are several factors that determine the number of community members participating in JPK-Gakin
1 The influence of marketing methods and the ability of local activists in promoting the scheme at community level (kaders, midwives and village officials)
The marketing methods, skills and motivation of kaders largely influences whether or not people will enroll in the scheme
In areas where the kaders are highly motivated and active, people are more likely to be enrolled in the scheme, whereas this is not the case in areas where the kaders play a more subdued role
This might be the most effective way to socialize the scheme, and this will be elaborated upon further in the next section
2 The ability of the community to receive and understand information given to them, whether orally or in writing
This might relate to their education level
3 Community perception of puskesmas services (cost/fees, facilities available, service quality, effectiveness of medication/drugs, etc)
4 The influence of conventional promotion and marketing efforts conducted by Bapels (flyers, leaflets, radio and newspaper ads, etc.)
This method is, however, quite expensive and often is not effective
Identification using village-level informants has been used in the Purbalingga District since the JPK-Gakin scheme started there in 2002
This is done by the so-called village volunteers (kaders) who play a major role in the identification, verification and socialization processes
Typical kaders are the wives of the local Household Association (Rukun Tetangga-RT) Head or the wives of an important member of the community, such as a teacher, a religious leader (ulama) or a civil servant
Kaders operate at the grassroots of the community and at least one kader has been identified in each RT
Using kaders reduces the barriers of communication with the community and also the costs of performing the identification
This is because kaders live within the community and thus know many of the community members
Secondly, kaders have ready access to information needed to identify the poor, and finally, community members are more likely to consider information received from kaders more seriously than those that were communicated by government officials, who often do not live in the community and have more distant and impersonal relationships with community members compared with kaders
Since kaders have closer relations with prospective members living in their community and tend to be well respected by the community, this might have contributed to the high level of membership in Purbalingga's JPKGakin scheme (nearly two-thirds of Purbalingga citizens by the end of 2004)
Kaders also have extensive powers in determining which prospective members should be classified as poor and which ones as non-poor
While they receive a prospective member's list made by the Bapel, they have the authority to verify and adapt it if necessary
When kaders make modifications to the prospective members list, neither the Bapel nor the puskesmas usually challenge them
This indicates the influence of kaders judgement in determining members of the insurance scheme
On the other hand, the DinKes in both East Sumba and Tabanan has not used the kader system as extensively as Purbalingga
In East Sumba, the identification is carried out by the puskesmas staff, bidan desa (village midwives), and the village head and his/her assistants
During the first period (2003), there were many complaints and requests from people eligible for JPK-Gakin who had not received their insurance cards
Changes were subsequently made in 2004 to include additional village level helpers which resulted in a better outcome (and higher level of poverty) and higher level of satisfaction in the second phase of the pilot
Still the DinKes and members of the Bapel acknowledge that there are problems with the identification process, and that the criteria that are currently used are not very useful
In Tabanan, the identification of the poor was performed within a period of three months by DinKes staff, the village head, the dusun head and members of the puskesmas
After the initial year they realized that this process was not very effective and had a number of weaknesses
For next year the plan is to involve the health officials, the village midwife and volunteers from each village (kaders) to make identification of the poor easier
The lack of a clear division of roles in the socialization process of the Askes-Gakin scheme in Tabanan seems to have limited the success of the program
Unlike the case of Purbalingga, the village midwife and kaders play no role in the socialization of health insurance for the poor in Tabanan
In this district the socialization is mainly through the Kepala Dusun (Kelian Dinas) who would explain the scheme to the poor in their neighborhood
To conclude, the socialization of the Askes Gakin scheme in Tabanan appears to be rather minimal
Many village heads who received health insurance cards to be distributed to the people did not know what they were for
In addition, feedback from people in the neighborhoods indicates that the majority of citizens have not heard about the scheme
We can conclude that for both the identification and socialization of prospective JPKGakin members, the related stakeholders need to be identified and the existence of a clear process increases its accuracy
Looking at the identification process, it seems that to maximize accuracy in identifying prospective members at grassroots level, it is necessary to have enumerators who live with the prospective members and are well informed about their economic and social conditions
This has been done by Purbalingga
By using wellrespected community members as kaders in the identification and socialization process, they were able to socialize the JPK-Gakin program in the district very well
Since nearly two-thirds of Purbalingga citizens are current members of the insurance scheme, this seems to indicate that the kader's efforts contributed greatly to the high rate of enrollment
F MONITORING AND COORDINATION OF STAKEHOLDERS 
Financial monitoring of the JPK-Gakin program is supposed to be done by the District Auditing Board (Badan Pengawas Daerah-Bawasda), while monitoring the quality of the health services of the puskesmas and RSUD is done by the Bapel from the reports on financial and expenditure data submitted by the puskesmas and RSUDs
Formally, DinKes as part of the Advisory Board of JPKM, is responsible for monitoring the work of the Bapel as well as the effect of JPK-Gakin on utilization rates and service quality
Health care providers (puskesmas, pustu and hospital) all provide monthly reports on utilization rates and expenditures to the DinKes
This kind of monitoring is, however, rather limited and does not provide information concerning why people do or do not make use of health care services if they need it
In addition, quality assessments of health care services in the facilities offering JPKGakin services are not done
It can be said that the existing monitoring mechanisms were mainly focused on financial monitoring alone
All districts studied (East Sumba, Purbalingga and Tabanan) also referred to a Community Complaints Unit or UPM (Unit Pengaduan Masyarakat) whose role is to record complaints on JPK-Gakin health services
Nevertheless, this cannot be seen as a sufficient mechanism to control the quality of services because the UPM does not have a clear policy and authority
In addition, there is no independent monitoring of the JPK-Gakin scheme done by the clients or community groups/NGOs and such monitoring is not encouraged by the local governments
Thus, the opportunity for stakeholders to monitor the accountability and transparency of JPK-Gakin expenditures is very limited
There also appears to be little coordination between involved parties (DinKes, Bapel and providers) in monitoring the use and the finances of JPKM
Specifically, it is unclear whether the financial and utilization reports submitted by health providers were checked and verified by other government agencies (DinKes and Bapel)
We found that each case (of complaint) would be handled separately by the above coordinating team but they do not meet regularly
This kind of vague monitoring mechanism and coordination could be found in all of the districts studies (East Sumba, Purbalingga and Tabanan)
Without careful and continuous monitoring of JPK-Gakin finances, the possibility of misallocation and misuse of JPK-Gakin funds for the benefit of those who are not Gakin could not be ruled out completely
One should be cautious of the fact that virtually all claims for JPK-Gakin services were approved
This might indicate that there has been a lack of verification to ensure that the services that were claimed were actually delivered
Without such verification, there is a strong possibility that some of these claims have been falsified
Measuring the level of satisfaction with health care services, especially when they are provided for free, is very difficult
When services are provided for free there is less likelihood that the clients will complain about those services
In addition, the assessment capabilities of a society with a low knowledge of health and health care is not a good benchmark
One option to filter complaints is at the community level through the kader, but such a system does not seem to have developed here
G THIRD PARTIES PARTICIPATION (PRIVATE SECTOR, INSURANCE CARRIER, CLIENTS, ETC.) 
Private providers With the exception of a private hospital in East Sumba that is allowed to accept JPKGakin patients, private providers are not included as participants in the JPK-Gakin scheme
This reduces the access and choice of JPKM members in their health care, since they are only able to use their entitlement at public facilities (puskesmas and RSUD), while a large number of citizens, even the poor ones, still prefer to be serviced by private providers rather than public ones
This might contribute to the perception of some JPKGakin members that the health services offered by the public providers are inadequate or lacking in quality
Part of the reason why private providers are reluctant to join the scheme is because of the large discrepancy between the cost of health services performed at private and public facilities
Since public facilities (especially puskesmas) are heavily subsidized by the government, prices are kept much lower than the market prices
For instance, the user fee at puskesmas in East Sumba is just Rp2,000/person/visit (and is waived for Gakin scheme members), while private doctors would charge at least Rp20,000/person/visit for general consultations
In addition, under JPK-Gakin, providers are reimbursed on a capitation basis, while virtually every private provider prefers to use a fee-for-service (FFS) arrangement
As long as the reimbursement arrangement is still via capitation, it would be very difficult to attract private providers to join the JPK-Gakin scheme
On the other hand, the FFS arrangement in the long run would not be financially sustainable, since providers have an incentive to prescribe expensive treatments and medications to their patients, knowing that they would be fully reimbursed by the insurance program, resulting in the collapse of the program over the long run
A balanced approach would be to find a way to reimburse private providers either at the market price they charge, while containing the cost so that the program would be sustainable over the long run
This will be elaborated upon in the policy recommendation section
Insurance Manager/Carrier The choice of insurance manager/carrier is also becoming more limited, with the creation of the PT Askes monopoly to manage the JPK-Gakin scheme, starting on 1 January 2005
The decision was made by the Health Ministry without advance consultation with local governments, Bapels and other stakeholders, creating tensions between the Health Ministry, PT Askes and local governments that could potentially create disincentives between them to cooperate and coordinate JPK-Gakin operations
As a result, in some districts, there might be two JPK-Gakin carriers operating simultaneously
PT Askes (funded through the PKPS-BBM grant) and the local JPKGakin scheme (funded through the APBD-DAU grant)
This has been the case in East Sumba and this could potentially occur in other districts as well
If these two schemes continue to exist with little cooperation and consultation between them, the result will be confusion among JPK-Gakin members and the possibility that service quality could be compromised
Since the PT Askes benefit package will be uniform in all Indonesian districts, it will not take into account local conditions that might necessitate changes in the benefit package (for instance, providing health care in a remote rural district)
In addition, under PT Askes, the beneficiaries would not be able to choose the best insurance carrier for themselves, since, under the new government policy, PT Askes would run JPK-Gakin as a public monopoly
Our analysis above shows that local JPK-Gakin schemes tend to offer a better benefit package than PT Askes does, and are often better socialized to prospective clients
There are also indications that clients are more likely to approach local DinKes or Bapel when they have complaints about JPK-Gakin services, but less likely to approach PT Askes, which is perceived to be a central government institution which is more bureaucratic and distant from them
Thus, it might be necessary for the government to rethink its plan to entrust the management of JPK-Gakin to PT Askes, and instead create a plan where PT Askes and district governments work more closely in providing JPK-Gakin services 
in which the district will have more authority to change the benefit package of JPK-Gakin to make it more accommodative to local conditions
Members/clients 
There is little involvement of JPK-Gakin members/clients in the design, implementation and monitoring of the scheme
JPKM members are just passive clients who were registered, paid the premium, received a membership card and obtained health services from JPK-Gakin providers
They do not participate in the decision-making of the scheme itself
Of course, some members did file complaints to the DinKes and Bapel when they received unsatisfactory services, 
however, one has to be a very assertive person in doing so, taking the initiative to file the complaint, following them up and so forth
Without doing this, it is unlikely that the complaint will receive a positive response from the scheme managers
Finally, JPK-Gakin members participation is limited to filing complaints when receiving unsatisfactory services from the health providers
They are/were not involved in the design, implementation or monitoring of the program
This makes the management of the program less transparent and accountable to its stakeholders, especially its members
V CONCLUSIONS 
Based on our research findings, we can conclude that the JPK-Gakin scheme has been more successful in providing access to adequate health care coverage for members of the population, especially the poor in comparison to previous health financing schemes promoted in Indonesia
This is because JPK-Gakin is administered and managed by local governments (the funding is shared between central and local government budgets)
Thus, it is easier for the government to develop innovations within the scheme, dealing with problems and members complaints, and taking into account local conditions that might affect health care delivery in a particular region (for example, very remote regions or regions that are vulnerable to periodic epidemics such as malaria)
The scheme needs to be improved in several ways, however, in order to enhance its effectiveness, improve its efficiency and improve the quality of services received by its beneficiaries/clients
There are several problems that need to be addressed immediately by the DinKes, the Bapel and health providers
If these problems are not rectified, they could hinder the effectiveness of JPK-Gakin in delivering its service to its members/clients
There seems to be a lack of efficiency in the management of JPK-Gakin funds by health providers (especially at RSUD)
Claims were approved with little verification and inspection to ensure that they were accurate and there are indications that most of the funds were used to subsidize the care of non-poor patients rather than the poor ones who were supposed to benefit (see below)
Making the scheme better targeted towards the poor should become the government's priority if the goal of the program to make health services more accessible to the poor is to be realized
There appear to be a number of formal and informal barriers that have the effect of discouraging some Gakin members from using the services to which they are entitled
These include high transportation costs, the delay in the distribution of their membership card, etc
Such barriers might discourage the poor from using JPK-Gakin services, and combined with the existing perception about the quality of government-provided health facilities, could make many JPK-Gakin members reluctant to seek treatment in these facilities
The low utilization rate of JPK-Gakin members using the services they are entitled to results in the misallocation of Gakin subsidies to the supposedly better-off members, who could actually afford to pay some of their own health care costs
It is likely that most of these funds were used instead to upgrade the buildings and medical equipment of the hospital and to subsidize other hospital patients, especially those coming from upper income brackets
For instance, in Purbalingga it is estimated that 79% of the JPK-Gakin funds subsidize the health care services of non-poor at puskesmas and at the local public hospital (RSUD) with 87.63% of overall JPK-Gakin funds being expended on non-poor patients
In order for the JPK-Gakin scheme to become truly pro-poor, this misallocation needs to be addressed
There is little involvement of non-government stakeholders, and JPK-Gakin members/clients in particular in the design, implementation and monitoring of the scheme
JPK-Gakin members are passive clients who do not participate in the decision-making of the scheme itself
This makes the management of the program less transparent and accountable to its stakeholders, especially its members
With the exception of East Sumba, there is no involvement of private health providers in the provision of health services for JPK-Gakin members
They are only able to seek health services in publicly managed health facilities (puskesmas and RSUD)
The fact that most private providers do not participate in the scheme results in a more limited choice of health providers available for its members, which could deny them access to better quality services
The choice of insurance manager/carrier is also becoming more limited, with the creation of the PT Askes monopoly to manage the JPK-Gakin scheme
The decision was made by MoH without advance consultation with local governments, Bapels and other stakeholders, creating tensions between MoH, PT Askes, and these stakeholders that could potentially create disincentives between them to cooperate and coordinate JPK-Gakin operations
JPK-Gakin funding largely depends on subsidies from the fuel subsidy compensation (PKPS-BBM) scheme and from the general block grant (Dana Alokasi Umum DAU) given by central government to district/local governments that largely funds the local government budget (APBD)
Funding from other sources (e.g member's premiums) only forms a small part of the program's overall funding
In the long run, this might make the scheme unsustainable as PKPS-BBM and DAU grants are reduced, creating potential disruptions in the delivery of services
Other than the required quarterly financial reports, there is little monitoring done by the Bapel and DinKes on the use of JPK-Gakin funds by providers
Thus, it is not known whether all the reimbursement claims made by the providers are made for services actually provided
This could provide the opportunity to misuse the funds through the submission of fraudulent claims
Coordination between related government agencies (DinKes, Bapel, and health providers) could be improved further
While in these three districts there are efforts to coordinate the operation of the JPK-Gakin scheme, the outcome has not yet been optimized 
and turf-battles and finger-pointing between these agencies when problems arise are still common
Table 7 below summarizes the main findings of this study
VI POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS 
To address these problems and to make the JPK-Gakin scheme work better, the following recommendations should be implemented by the government, Bapel, health providers and other stakeholders
We have targeted these recommendations at the local government that manages and implements the JPK-Gakin scheme, as well as the central government (Ministry of Health) that would supervise and provide policy advice to the local implementers
We have divided these recommendations into short, medium and long-term recommendations, based on our assessments of how long it would take to implement them
Most of these recommendations would be implemented by local governments, after consultation with the central government, the private sector, NGOs and, most importantly, their citizens who are the beneficiaries of the JPK-Gakin scheme
Short-term recommendations (implemented within the next 1 year)
Increase coordination between different government agencies, especially between DinKes and PT Askes in managing JPK-Gakin delivery at the local level
Coordination should be done continuously and not just be limited to formal monthly meetings and quarterly financial reports
PT Askes officials and DinKes officials should work closely together (perhaps in the same office) to resolve a situation or problem within the scheme immediately after it has been identified
Create clear guidelines on the functions, duties and responsibilities of each government agency in administering the JPK-Gakin scheme at the local level
DinKes (with the help of puskesmas, village heads and kaders) could be tasked with collecting updated information regularly about Gakin members, distributing the membership cards, and monitoring the financial management of the scheme
PT Askes would be tasked with paying out reimbursement claims of health providers; and health providers (puskesmas and RSUD) would provide health services to Gakin members
With such guidelines, the functions of each agencies would be clarified and turf-battles between them could be avoided
Eliminate formal and informal barriers for Gakin families to use the services to which they are entitled
This could be achieved for instance by speeding up the distribution of Gakin membership cards and by providing some transportation subsidies for Gakin patients
The government also needs to eliminate the misallocation of Gakin subsidies to higher income groups, to ensure that the JPKGakin scheme truly meets its intended purpose to provide health financing for poor families
Improve the efficiency of health services delivery by health providers (puskesmas and RSUD)
Health services given to JPK-Gakin members should be appropriate to their needs and should be medically necessary
For instance, the use of more expensive but not medically necessary services/treatments (such as patented drugs) should be limited by the imposition of efficiency-controlling mechanisms
Stricter monitoring procedures should be introduced to ensure that Gakin funds are used as efficiently as possible and that all the expended funds are actually accounted for
Improve the quality of services provided by puskesmas
Many citizens perceive puskesmas to have poor quality services, and thus, they are not willing to seek primary health care treatment there
Incentives to improve the quality of health service delivery at puskesmas should be introduced
At the same time, however, puskesmas should not use such incentives to increase the salaries or to pay out cash bonuses to puskesmas staff
Improve socialization/marketing techniques to recruit new JPK-Gakin members, using low-cost mass-marketing tools that would have wide credibility among prospective clients
Kaders might be a potential tool for such socialization purposes
Incentives could be created to make kaders more productive in recruiting new members
This could include a regular honorarium for kaders that is higher than the current financial incentives available to them
Medium-term recommendations (implemented within one to two years)
Reactivate puskesmas activities at the village level (especially in remote districts), for instance, through reintroducing mobile health clinics (puskesmas keliling) 
or by training village level health providers (such as alternative healers (dukun) so that they are able to provide first-aid medical assistance to villagers in cases of more serious medical emergency when doctors and other health practitioners are absent from the puskesmas travelling in the puskesmas keliling (mobile clinic)
These village providers would also be able to provide referrals to the puskesmas in cases where they could not treat the patients due to the seriousness of the patient's medical condition
By doing this, it is hoped that access to health facilities at the village level can be improved and that citizens do not have to seek treatment at puskesmas unless their conditions cannot be treated at the village level
Implement measures to increase the participation rate of JPK-Gakin members in the planning, implementation and monitoring of the scheme
The members should be allowed a voice in the decision-making process affecting their welfare and their membership in the JPK-Gakin scheme
The creation of a JPK-Gakin members association at grassroots level might be the first step to achieving this goal
Provide stricter monitoring (both internal and external) to ensure that the JPKGakin funds allocated to provide health services at RSUD and puskesmas are spent effectively and efficiently
The monitoring should be done both by Bapel (or Bawasda) and also by an independent monitoring unit that could be set up by an NGO/CSO, by the community or by a JPK-Gakin members association
Consider including private providers (e.g private doctors, private hospitals and health clinics) in the list of providers of the JPK-Gakin scheme
This would increase the choice of providers for members of the scheme and would improve their access to needed health services
In order to attract private providers into the scheme, higher reimbursement payments set close to the market rate might be necessary so that the payment would be in line with the rate charged by private providers
This might, however, require premium increases that might force some JPK-Gakin members to drop out of the scheme because they could no longer afford the premium
Consider ending the monopoly of PT Askes as the insurance carrier for the JPKGakin scheme and open the selection of insurance carrier to a competitive bidding process done by each local government
These companies would run the financial management, claims and reimbursement of the Gakin funds in each region, while local governments (DinKes) would continue to issue appropriate regulations and monitor how the program is operated
All insurance companies (both state and privately owned) should be allowed to participate in this bidding process and given a chance to manage the JPK-Gakin scheme based on their previous achievements and their ability to service their clients efficiently
Long-term recommendations (implemented in three or more years)
Efforts need to be taken to reduce or eliminate the dependency of the JPK-Gakin scheme on the PKPS-BBM and APBD-DAU grants to make it self-financing through premiums or other contributions from members/clients, either through increasing premiums for better-off non-Gakin members or by introducing new taxes to fund the scheme (e.g by introducing local cigarette and liquor taxes)
Of course, efforts need to be taken to ensure that this measure does not reduce members access to health services they need and would not disrupt local economic activity or affect the local labor market
Consider charging a minimum premium rate (or co-insurance) for JPK-Gakin members, 
since it seems that paying Gakin members are more likely to demand better services from the providers than non-paying ones 
and are more likely to complain when these services are not delivered to their satisfaction
Of course, the charges imposed on Gakin members should be set at an appropriate minimum level so that they would not drop out from the JPK-Gakin scheme altogether due to affordability issues
This has been done in the Rembang District where Gakin members are required to pay a premium of Rp5,000/person/year to receive their program benefits
It has been quite successful, because the poor pay a small portion of their premium they are more inclined to monitor the service quality of their health services and to complain if they think they are receiving unsatisfactory treatment
Carefully study the possibility of introducing a health voucher scheme, in which poor citizens would directly control the health subsidies given to them (instead of the current scheme where the subsidies were given to health providers)
This is done to minimize possible leakage of the subsidy to higher income patients and to promote accountability and improved service quality
Voucher holders could choose any health providers they feel would provide the best services available to them (both public and private providers would be allowed to treat voucher holders), so there would be competition between providers to attract the most voucher holders to their facilities and this could only be accomplished if their services are improved and more accountable
Of course, leakage could also occur in a voucher scheme if the poor voucher holders are able to sell their vouchers to those who have higher income, 
so steps should be taken to minimize this possibility (such as recording the names of voucher holders and assigning them a unique identification number)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Sulawesi Agricultural Area Development Project (SAADP) is an economic commercial project whose aim is to reduce poverty in Central Sulawesi and South-east Sulawesi
It was funded by a World Bank loan and was implemented between August 1996 and December 2003
In 1999 the project was redesigned in such a way that its focus changed from agricultural area development to local community initiatives (IMS) with stress on micro-finance activities, which at the village level are managed by the Unit for Management of Village Activities/Finances (UPKD)
The present socioeconomic impact evaluation of SAADP, which was undertaken in the context of providing an alternative input for the final SAADP report, was carried out by the SMERU Research Institute between February and May 2004 at the request of the World Bank
(a) to assess the economic and social impacts of SAADP;
(b) to examine the ways in which the SAADP implementation process at the local level has influenced outcomes;
and (c) to study SAADP experiences in the interests of further policy development and the design of possible follow-on activities
The study combined a quantitative household survey and in-depth interviews with key informants
Field research was carried out in four districts, namely Donggala and Tolitoli in the Province of Central Sulawesi and Konawe Selatan (Konsel) and Muna in the Province of South-east Sulawesi
In each district, three villages that had participated in SAADP were selected along with one control village, which is a village that had not participated in SAADP and was similar to the other sample villages in geographical typology and socioeconomic characteristics
The study involved 618 respondent households, of which 408 had participated in SAADP, 90 were control households living in the SAADP sample villages, and 120 were control households in the control villages
Sample households were chosen randomly, except for control households in the SAADP villages, which were selected purposively
Research findings indicate that project socialization at the village level was generally carried out more than once
On the first occasion, the SAADP facilitator explained the project purpose and implementation process
On the second occasion, socialization took the form of a village discussion to establish UPKD management
Even so, only around 60% of SAADP respondents stated that they had obtained their first information about the project from a village meeting
Information from the field reveals a number of differences in implementation between the first stage of the project and the following or revolving stage
In the first stage poor members of the community were selected as participants
Credit requests were submitted through groups in the form of a written proposal
The time between submission and the distribution of loans was relatively long because participants had to wait until the government released funds
Loans were channeled to participants either directly or through groups
Interest on loans was between 15% and 18% per year
The size of each loan was decided by a village verification team and loans were repaid through heads of groups or directly to the UPKD management
In the revolving stage, the giving of loans focused on persons who were considered able to repay them
Even public servants and village officials were able to borrow
Usually individual members of the community made an oral request for a loan to UPKD office-holders
Almost all loans were handed directly to the participant relatively quickly, with some borrowers even receiving the money at the time of the request
The annual interest rate was set higher at 18% to 24%
The size of the loan was decided by the UPKD management and in most cases the money was repaid directly to the management
Quantitative data show that most households (83%) were accepted as SAADP participants because they owned an economic activity while only 17% were selected because they were poor
Most loan proposals (76%) were submitted through a group and only 69% were in written form, even though the majority consisted of requests made at the beginning of the project
Furthermore, approximately 35% of proposals were prepared by UPKD office-holders
Around 64% of loans were available within one month
Loans ranged in size between Rp200,000 and Rp5 million, with most between Rp500,000 and Rp1 million
In the majority of cases (92%), annual interest was between 15 % and 24%
On the whole, groups were formed only as a formality to meet project requirements
The majority (87%) were based on similarity in type of economic activity
For the most part groups functioned only at the beginning of the project, specifically at the time when loan proposals were submitted
The group was formed at the initiative of UPKD office-holders in 49% of cases
Only 33% of groups were formed at the initiative of the participants themselves
Only 59% of SAADP household respondents knew about the process of UPKD formation
The UPKD was established through a village discussion
Some 46% of respondents were involved in the sense that they were present at the village discussion and took part in the selection process
The majority of respondents (68%) said that the UPKD office-holders were ordinary members of the community, while 31% said that they were community figures
Community evaluation of the capacity of UPKD office-holders varied
Most SAADP respondents (71%) said that the persons concerned were competent in handling the UPKD and 66% felt that UPKD service was good
Some 52% said that the UPKD officeholders played a part in decision-making about internal UPKD regulations and the credit mechanism, while 43% said that the village community played a role in decisionmaking of this kind
At the beginning of the project UPKD management consisted of four to five officeholders, namely a chairman, a secretary/collector of credit installments, a treasurer, a head of economic activities, and a head of physical activities
Soon after the project became operational, however, the number was reduced to only three, namely a chairman, a secretary, and a treasurer
This management structure still exists in all sample districts except Muna, where is handled by only the chairman
According to the program stipulations, the UPKD management should be re-elected after three years, but in practice this regulation has been ignored
In many villages, there has been a change in office-holders but it has been for other reasons
UPKD management generally has not been transparent
Only 34% of respondents said that there was or had once been information that the community could access about the UPKD's financial position
Reporting to and supervision by the community through a village meeting did not take place
The reasons being that this aspect was not emphasized during socialization
In addition, the village discussion forum did not function as intended
As a consequence, the community had very little sense of project ownership
Furthermore, the situation was complicated by the low levels of education among the community
The system by which the UPKD was to report to higher levels at project management only functioned while the project was still in existence and when facilitators were still employed
After that, reporting activities in Konsel and Muna Districts ceased
Although in Tolitoli and Donggala districts reporting is still done, it is no longer a routine procedure
At the same time, supervision by higher administrative levels has been inadequate
On the whole, higher officials visited villages only once a year and even then only at the beginning of project implementation
Only the facilitators, who usually visited the village once a month to assist the UPKD, provided any kind of routine supervision
The non-transparent system of UPKD management, the minimum amount of assistance given to the UPKD, and the weak supervision of UPKD performance resulted in a number of cases of misuse of project funds
Village residents, especially those who were SAADP participants, believe that there is urgent need for an institution to supervise the UPKD
In fact, steps in this direction have already been taken in Central Sulawesi with the formation of the UPKD Supervisory Body at village level; however, it has not yet achieved maximum performance
Even the UPKD management would like the village and subdistrict governments to be involved, particularly in supervision of credit repayment by the community
This is related to the fact that UPKD office-holders do not have authority and competence over the community
In a number of sample villages, the UPKD is still the only formal financial institution but there are wide variations in its current condition
Some UPKDs are functioning relatively well, some are still functioning but with a very limited amount of funds to lend out, and some have ceased to function completely
The main problem faced by the majority of UPKDs is that loans have not been repaid
This has happened because on the one hand the community does not feel that it owns the UPKD yet on the other hand the UPKD is unable to impose sanctions as it is not a legal entity
The UPKD likewise has no special relationship with the formal banking sector
It is an ordinary bank customer that opened an account with the nearest branch of the Indonesian People's Bank (BRI) at the beginning of the project for the purpose of receiving SAADP funds from a higher level
In its implementation, the SAADP project in general did not differentiate between women and men
Both women and men have been directly involved as credit recipients, facilitators, and UPKD office-holders, although not in equal proportions
The majority (85%) of SAADP household respondents said that there was no discrimination against women in the submission of credit proposals
The fact that only 27% of all loans went to women is explained by the regulation that each household could receive only one loan within one budget year
On the whole, women used their loans in accordance with their proposals, which is as business capital in the trade sector
With the availability of SAADP credit, the trading activities of many women progressed rapidly, while there was also an increase in the number of women who entered this sector
SAADP also had a positive effect on changes in the role of women in productive economic activities (12%), the figure being statistically significant at the 5% level
Similarly, changes in the role of women in household decision-making (5%) and in community activities at village, hamlet, and neighborhood levels (6%) are positive, although the values are not statistically significant
In order to provide assistance to the community, the SAADP project included facilitators who were recruited from NGOs
In general, the facilitators played an important role at the beginning of the project in socialization activities, in facilitation of UPKD establishment, in the formation of groups, and in helping to prepare and select the initial credit proposals
After the project was functioning, the role of facilitators in assisting the community became much smaller and their activities focused instead on the UPKD, which they visited once or twice a month
For that reason it is not surprising that only 67% of SAADP respondents were aware of the existence of a facilitator in their village
In general, the community knew the facilitator only as the person who had given an explanation of the program during socialization and who had made several visits to the UPKD
The performance of facilitators varied greatly from village to village
Some were considered by the community to have been very good in their work, yet there were also cases of facilitators who gave incorrect information about project funds, a mistake that later made recipients in certain places reluctant to repay loans
There were even cases of facilitators who embezzled project funds
Nevertheless, the UPKDs generally felt that the presence of facilitators had been of real benefit to project implementation and that they are still needed
For the UPKD, the facilitator could constitute a person to consult about the management of SAADP funds and a source of moral support in facing community demands; at the same time his/her presence could encourage the repayment of loans
The facilitator also helped the UPKD in bookkeeping and in the preparation of reports on project implementation
Most SAADP respondents (73%) said that the extent of their involvement in the planning or implementation of local community activities had not altered
The impact of SAADP on increased involvement in activities was 6%, which is not statistically significant
The effect on greater participation in organizational activities was also insignificant
Only the effect on increased involvement in traditional ceremonies, which was 12%, which is statistically significant at 1% level
The influence of SAADP on the strengthening of local institutions was likewise relatively small, as indicated by the following
(i) by comparison with pre-project days, the village discussion forum did not develop except briefly at the very beginning of project implementation;
(ii) the group system did not function well;
(iii) activities at the village, hamlet and neighborhood levels did not undergo many changes;
and (iv) the UPKD system did nothing to strengthen other existing village institutions
In addition, there is no indication that SAADP implementation encouraged greater transparency at the local government level
This can be traced to the fact that within the UPKD management itself the principle of transparency was observed only at the beginning of the project when credit was distributed
The majority of respondents (90%) felt that the SAADP project had been of benefit to them as it provided capital to add to existing business capital, to establish new economic activities, or to finance other needs
Most (93%) also stated that loans had been used in accordance with the purpose stated in their credit proposal, while virtually all (99%) said that they had used the money as capital in agriculture (food and tree crops), trading activities, fishing, home industry, and other economic undertakings
In all sample areas there were households that had experienced an improvement in their business perspectives
The impact of SAADP being 15%, which is statistically significant at the 1% level
Qualitative information indicates that respondents usually obtained additional knowledge from neighbors, friends, or their own experiences
The type of knowledge in which the greatest increase occurred was diversification in activities
While the types most affected by SAADP were production techniques (11%), marketing (8%) and administration/finances (7%)
The effect on these three types of knowledge was statistically significant at the 1% level
While the effect on greater knowledge about diversification (6%) was not statistically significant
The impact of SAADP on changes in business practices was also positive (5%) but insignificant, while the effect on each type of business practice was relatively small
There were positive effects on marketing practices (2%), production techniques (9%) and administration/finance practices (1%)
The effect on diversification in business activities was negative (-4%)
Only production techniques experienced an effect that was statistically significant (at 1% level)
Qualitative information indicates that SAADP assistance led to the appearance of new economic undertakings in all sample locations, although they varied in type and number depending on the creativity of community members and the effectiveness of SAADP implementation
Even so, there was no relationship between diversification in economic activities and increased capacity among respondents to face economic shocks
Although the impact of SAADP on diversification was negative, the effect on increased capacity to face shocks was positive (8%)
SAADP had a positive impact on increases in all types of agricultural perspectives among farming respondents
The greatest effect was on knowledge about land management (13%) and the use of fertilizer (12%), both figures being significant at the 1% level
The effect on marketing knowledge (8%) was significant at the 5% level, while effects on knowledge about the use of pesticide (7%) and post-harvest handling of crops (4%) were insignificant
SAADP also had a positive impact on changes in farming practices
The greatest effect being on land management practices (15%, which is significant at 5% level)
The effects on practices in fertilizer use (10%) and marketing practices (8%) are significant at 1% level
The effects on other farming practices (the use of pesticide and post-harvest handling of crops) were not significant
On the whole, the level of use of fertilizer and pesticide is relatively low, except in Tolitoli
Even so, there were numbers of households that increased their use of agricultural inputs
SAADP had positive effects on the use of green fertilizer (9%) and pesticide (12%) (both significant at 1% level) and on the use of chemical fertilizer (8%) (significant at 5% level)
Most SAADP respondents (74%) said that their nominal household income has risen
Overall, the difference in the proportions of SAADP and control households that experienced an increase in nominal income was 9%, which is significant at 5% level
Nevertheless, the impact of SAADP on the average changes in real household income was small (0.5%) although positive, as was the effect on the average changes in real expenditure (5.4%), but these values are statistically insignificant
SAADP had a positive though statistically insignificant influence on the tendency to save
Most respondents kept savings in the form of money, which they deposited in a bank or retained at home
At the same time there was very little change in the condition of the majority of houses and associated facilities owned by respondents
The effect of SAADP on changes in housing and associated facilities was generally relatively small and shows no definite pattern
The effect on changes in the ownership of valuable goods (such as electronic goods, bicycles, and motor-cycles), land and livestock likewise does not show a clear pattern
The targeting of SAADP in poverty reduction was appropriate if seen in terms of village selection, for the villages that were chosen were in the poor category, had experienced drought and economic crises, and in many cases were IDT
Nevertheless, the target, which at the commencement of the project was poor households, has shifted to persons who owned an economic undertaking or were deemed able to repay the loan
Survey results show that although most (58%) of those who received loans have a low level of education (completion of elementary school at the most), the proportion of participants with a senior high school education, who generally come from the better-off groups in the community, is not small (22%)
Furthermore, relatively better-off households tended to receive loans more frequently
The households (59%) that received three or more loans belong to the relatively better-off groups
Quantitative data also show that the impact of SAADP on poverty reduction, while relatively small and statistically insignificant, tended to be positive
The effects on households that were still poor (-3%) and that changed from not poor to poor (-1%) are negative in value
While the figures for still not poor and poor to not poor are positive
This means that the proportion of SAADP households that were still poor was lower than the proportion of control households in this category, while the proportion of still not poor households was greater
The proportion of SAADP households that changed from poor to not poor was higher and from not poor to poor was lower
Meanwhile, in terms of the impact on welfare distribution, which is indicated by the difference in change in the Gini Ratio between SAADP and control households (0.0305)
The decline in welfare gap among SAADP households was smaller than among control households
The effects of SAADP on other indicators of welfare among poor households were generally insignificant but positive
The effect on ability of poor households to pay for children's education was 11%, ability to access health services was 10%, ability to participate in traditional ceremonies was 10%, and ability to face economic shocks was 4%
Examined from the aspects of UPKD development, the implementation mechanism, and the impact on the socioeconomic situation of the community, the evaluation results lead to the conclusion that the degree of success of the SAADP project has varied from place to place
Even so, it can be said that on the whole the SAADP project has not been a success as there are many UPKDs that are no longer functioning and the impact on social and economic conditions at community level has been relatively small
There are many weaknesses in SAADP project implementation
Since the existence of non-functioning UPKDs can influence the performance of other UPKDs and since the funds and resources already expended are quite large, while the existence of the UPKD is still felt to be important for the community, the SAADP project, if it is to be continued, should focus on reviving, improving, and expanding the existing UPKDs so that they can form an example for future project implementation
Cases of UPKDs that are not running well or have ceased to function must be settled through a village discussion that is facilitated by the local regional government, for example by forming a special team to handle loans that are in arrears
UPKDs that have performed well should be expanded and improved in the following aspects
(i) while awaiting ratification of micro credit legislation, the legal status of the UPKD as an institution must be raised, for example by a Provincial Regulation, so that it will have power and authority to take action according to the law;
(ii) the UPKD needs further institutional improvement in its regulations, management structure, supervision, and reporting, so that it can grow into an independent financial institution;
(iii) the UPKD should operate as a business entity and not as an agent of development in order to ensure sustainability in its undertakings;
(iv) continuous improvement must be made in the ability of UPKD office-holders;
(v) the scope of UPKD activities should be kept to productive activities in order to ensure that loans are returned and that money circulates;
(vi) to prevent defaulting, consideration should be given to the introduction of collateral requirements that can be easily met by community members yet are binding on them;
(vii) credit can be channeled on an individual basis or else through groups
In case of group development must be undertaken in a consistent way through the application of certain fixed standards;
(viii) there is need for a serious commitment on the part of regional governments to the provision of support for UPKD development;
(ix) supervision, guidance, and training are very important and must be integrated into every phase;
(x) the role of facilitators in guiding participants in the development of their economic activities and the handling of credit must be increased
Facilitators should also be given adequate incentives and training to encourage better performance;
and (xi) in the future implementation of similar programs, new institutions should not be formed but instead existing institutions like the UPKD should be used so that efforts will not be counter-productive, the performance of existing institutions will be strengthened, and unhealthy competition will be avoided

Background
As one approach to poverty reduction in Central and South-east Sulawesi, the Indonesian government, with the assistance of the World Bank, initiated and developed the Sulawesi Agricultural Area Development Project (SAADP) as an economic and commercial project that was financed by a loan and implemented from August 1996 to December 2003
The objectives of the project were to increase farm incomes, to reduce disparities in income and welfare, and to increase regional government capacity and community participation in the expansion of economic undertakings
SAADP had four main components, namely, replication of farming systems (SUTA), livestock development, productive economic undertakings and infrastructure development support program, and local community initiatives (IMS)
As the follow-up to a project evaluation conducted in 1999, a number of basic changes were made to the focus of SAADP, which, from being an agriculture-based area development program, became a program based on local community initiatives
The purpose of these changes was to resolve the problems of complicated management structure and confusion caused by the original project design
After some basic changes were made, the majority of project activities were grouped under the IMS component, which was implemented through a new type of unit, namely the Unit for Management of Village Activities/Finances (UPKD), which placed emphasis on micro-financial activities
IMS activities continued until finalisation of the project
The Indonesian government has had much experience in the implementation of microfinancial undertakings
Most of which have encountered certain constraints
One of these constraints has been the belief on the part of the community that the government funds channeled to members of the community through these programs and projects represent grants that do not have to be returned
Through SAADP the government introduced micro-finance activities that closely resembled previous activities
Among the questions that arose was whether or not the new financial institutions established through SAADP would be more capable of surviving and expanding
And also, whether SAADP would make a contribution to and have a positive impact on the socioeconomic condition of the community
To answer these questions it is necessary to know how the project was implemented and what effect it had on the community, especially in view of the fact that the funds handled by the UPKDs were loans that had to be repaid
It is also important to know what part the UPKD played in the community and whether the UPKD is worth retaining with increased capacity so that in the long term it can play an independent role in providing the community with business capital
The Government of Indonesia (GoI) and the World Bank now are discussing a possible follow-on project aimed at upgrading and transforming the UPKDs into sustainable microfinancial institutions
To ensure that the follow-on project can fully reflect the lessons accumulated from SAADP, the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) of SAADP has been proposed to be an intensive learning ICR
In the context of providing alternative inputs for the final SAADP report, an Evaluation of the Socioeconomic Impact of SAADP was carried out by SMERU between February and May 2004 at the request of the World Bank
This report presents the findings of that evaluation
1.2 Research Objectives
The present study was undertaken to evaluate the implementation of SAADP in the period since the focus was changed to IMS in 1999 and in particular to examine micro-financial activities
The general objectives of this socioeconomic impact evaluation were
(a) to assess the economic and social impacts of SAADP since 1999,
(b) to examine the ways in which the process of SAADP implementation at the local level has affected outcomes,
and (c) to study SAADP experiences for further policy development and the design of possible followon activities
The socioeconomic impact evaluation focused specifically on the following questions
(i) In the project area, what groups have benefited from the project and what groups have not
What criteria were used for selecting villagers to participate in the project
Has project implementation resulted in a reduction of poverty incidence
How did the selection of project villages and implementation methodologies influence the targeting of the project and achievement of the project's development objectives
(ii) What are the observed benefits and costs for those who participated in the project
Has the beneficiaries' per capita income increased
Have their income sources been diversified so that they have a stronger capacity to deal with external shocks
Have traditional livelihood practices been improved
Has productivity increased
What is the relationship between the observed benefits and project implementation
(iii) Has the project fostered beneficiary participation in village planning and implementation of community activities
Has project implementation strengthened local institutions
Has the project improved the transparency of local governance
(iv) Has the UPKD system resulted in higher community financial literacy
Has the UPKD system had an improved financial management capacity (e.g managing risk, cash flow, book keeping, etc)
What is the relationship between the UPKD system and the formal banking sector
Did the UPKD system promote the development of local financial markets
(v) What was the degree of women's involvement in project implementation
How did women benefit or were they impacted negatively
(vi) What was the degree of NGO involvement in project implementation
What are the observed benefits from engaging NGOs
What is the general attitude of communities towards the involvement of NGOs
1.3 Research Methodology
The present study used a combination of a quantitative approach through household survey and a qualitiative approach that involved in-depth interviews with key informants
Data collection during the quantitative survey was based on the use of questionnaires, while interviews were based on an interview guide
The questionnaires were prepared in such a way as to cover the key points that had to be investigated in the study, while additional questions were included to obtain further clarification of certain matters
The focus of the qualitative information sought from key informants was on gaining a general understanding of project implementation and on clarification of a number of general points where information could not be adequately obtained through a questionnaire
In the context of ensuring representativeness of the sample, the survey was conducted in the two provinces where SAADP was implemented, namely, Central Sulawesi and South-east Sulawesi
Using data from the Directorate-General for Regional Development (Ditjen Bangda) within the Department for Home Affairs and from the World Bank in Jakarta, the SMERU research team selected two sample districts (kabupaten) from each of the two provinces
The basis of the choice was the greatest allocation of SAADP funds, variations in distance from the provincial capital (relatively close and relatively far), ease of access to the location, and security conditions
In each district one or two subdistricts (kecamatan) were chosen on a basis of the greatest number of villages involved in the SAADP project, the greatest allocation of SAADP funds, and the availability of a control village
Within these sample subdistricts three villages were selected that received the greatest allocation of SAADP funds from 1999 to mid 2002, that represented variations in the geographical typology of the district (coastal and non-coastal villages), and that had the highest population of all villages in that subdistrict
In addition to the villages that had participated in SAADP, the research also included control villages, that is, villages that had not received SAADP assistance, in order to estimate the net impact of project implementation
The control villages were selected in the sample subdistricts or in the nearest subdistricts and as far as posible were villages that had not experienced a similar project (such as PPK and P4K) and were similar to the SAADP villages in geographical typology and the socioeconomic characteristics of the people
Since data for districts, subdistricts and villages, as required in the above criteria, were available in Jakarta, selection of sample villages was done in Jakarta
In the case of subdistricts and villages selection, it had to be confirmed in the field, and if necessary, changes were made in accordance with field information
Field information was very much stressed in decisions about control villages so that villages could be selected that had almost the same characteristics as the SAADP villages in terms of the main sources of livelihood, housing conditions, and living standards of the community
In all, 618 households, consisting of 408 SAADP households and 210 control households, were interviewed
In each SAADP village approximately 34 SAADP households and 7 control households that had never participated in SAADP were interviewed
SAADP households were those that had received a SAADP loan for the first time between the year 2000 and the beginning of 2003
Meanwhile, in each control village 30 control households were interviewed
Respondent households from both SAADP households and control households in the control village were randomly chosen but consideration was given to the distribution of locations, that is, from two or three neighborhoods (RW), hamlets or blocks
Control households in the SAADP villages were selected in a purposive manner, the considerations being the fact that they should have socioeconomic characteristics similar to those in SAADP households and distribution of locations
Several key informants were also interviewed in each area
These informants included SAADP project leaders at provincial and district levels, SAADP consultants, cluster managers, former facilitators, subdistrict office staff and 12 UPKD managers
The method of analysis that was used to evaluate impact involved the measurement of changes in a number of indicators from the period before and the period after SAADP implementation among SAADP participants compared with control households
Since the SAADP participants and the nonparticipants had almost the same characteristics, the difference in change between the two sets of indicators was taken to represent the net impact of SAADP
It was hoped that, by comparing the changes between the two groups of households, it would be possible to remove or minimize the influence of other factors
Field research involved eight SMERU researchers and twelve local researchers who were divided into four teams
Each team was responsible for data collection in one district
Each team consisted of a team leader and four members and each had the same proportion of male and female researchers to facilitate interviews with both male and female respondents
1.4 Timetable
The preparatory stage of the research commenced in mid January 2004 and took approximately one month
This stage took in the study of secondary data, discussions about research methodology, preparation of questionnaires and interview guides, the selection of research locations and the recruitment and training of local researchers
Before the field survey was begun, research plans were discussed with relevant institutions, namely, Bangda, the World Bank and Bappenas, in order to obtain inputs
The field survey was conducted from the middle of February to the beginning of March 2004
Data entry and cleaning took the next four weeks
The whole SMERU team then compiled all findings and conducted an analysis of the results, which took another month
Before presentation of the final report at the beginning of June 2004, a discussion was held at SMERU in the third week of April 2004 to consider the preliminary findings and results of the evaluation
Participants in the discussion consisted of representatives from Bangda as the agency responsible for the project, representatives of the World Bank and SMERU researchers
Following the discussion a workshop to present evaluation results was held at the end of April 2004 in one of the survey areas, namely, Palu in Central Sulawesi
Participants consisted of project managers at central, provincial and district levels, project consultants, UPKD managers, former facilitators, NGOs, representatives from the banking sector, and World Bank representatives
The participants came from both the Central Sulawesi and South-East Sulawesi Provinces as well as from Jakarta
1.5 Systematic of the Report
This final report on the study consists of 10 chapters
Chapter 1 describes the background, objectives and research methods that were used in the study
Chapter 2 presents the characteristics of the sample districts and respondents and also the previous experiences of respondents with credit programs
Chapter 3 gives a brief summary of the SAADP project based on the Directions for Implementation (juklak) that was issued by Bangda in the year 2000
Chapter 4 presents details of the process of project implementation from the socialization stage, selection of participants, the credit mechanism, the system of reporting, supervision and evaluation, up to the status and condition of the SAADP project at the present time
Chapter 5, which describes the UPKD system, covers the selection of UPKD managers, management of the UPKD, and its effect on community knowledge
Chapter 6 describes the extent of involvement of women in the project as participants, UPKD managers, and facilitators, as well as the extent of NGO involvement in the project as facilitators
Chapter 7 explains the linkages between SAADP and local planning, institutional development and local transparency
The next two chapters contain the essence of the study in that they present an analysis of the impact of SAADP on socioeconomic conditions and poverty
In Chapter 8 the indicators of socioeconomic impact that are analysed take in the use of credit by project beneficiaries, changes in business and farming knowledge and practices, changes in the extent of diversification of income sources, and changes in per capita income
An analysis is also given of changes in savings behavior and changes in housing facilities and in the ownership of household assets
Chapter 9 describes the impact of SAADP on poverty
Several indicators are used in this analysis since poverty is complex and multidimensional in nature
One approach that is used is identification of the group that obtained the greatest benefits from this project, that is, whether it was poor, medium-income, or rich households within the village community that gained most from SAADP
At the same time an analysis was made of the transition that occurred in household poverty status from the pre-project period and the period after credit was provided
An analysis was also made of the changes that occurred in the inequality in household welfare and in household capacity to meet certain needs
Chapter 10 presents conclusions and policy recommendations
II CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SAMPLE 2.1
Village Characteristics Field research was carried out in four districts, namely Donggala and Tolitoli Districts in Central Sulawesi and Konawe Selatan (a part of the former Kendari District) and Muna Districts in South-east Sulawesi
As planned in the methodology for the study, three SAADP villages and one control village were selected in each district, making a total of 16 sample villages, 12 of them SAADP villages and 4 of them control villages (See Table 2.1.1)
In some cases the locations of the sample villages are in one subdistrict while in other cases they are in two different but adjacent subdistricts
In practice it was somewhat difficult to identify a control village that completely resembled the three SAADP villages, especially when time was limited
In a number of places therefore the plans for selection of control villages as intended in the methodology could not be fully adhered to
Nevertheless, before deciding on a control village the research team went through several stages to make the optimum selection by comparing the characteristics of a number of villages based on available quantitative data and information from certain resource persons in the field
At the very least, the selected control village was the one whose characteristics most closely resembled those of the SAADP villages
In Konsel District, for example, virtually all the villages in one subdistrict that had the same characteristics (in this case non-coastal villages) had participated in the SAADP project
The research team therefore decided to look for a control village in the adjacent subdistrict where there was likely to be a village that had the same characteristics
The main sources of livelihood of the community and the typology of SAADP and control villages in each district have close similarities
Even though BPS data shown in Table 2.1.1 indicate that the main sources of livelihood in the sample villages in one district are not completely the same, field information indicated that they were actually basically the same, that is, agricultural in nature, and that almost all food crop farmers had in fact become tree crop cultivators
If considered from the point of view of distance from the district capital, the villages in each district vary somewhat
Nevertheless, road conditions and forms of transportation available in the sample villages in each district are generally the same
Furthermore, the housing conditions of the local people and the availability of certain social and economic facilities are relatively the same
The aspect that proved difficult in the selection of control villages was identification of villages that had had similar non-SAADP government programs
One reason was that there was a large range of government programs among the villages and in many cases the existence of some of these programs became known only after interviews were conducted with respondents
On the whole, however, the same non-SAADP government programs existed among control villages and households as among SAADP villages and households
The proportion of respondent households that were recipients of government programs outside SAADP proved to be relatively small, being only 3.9% of SAADP households and 5.7% of control households (see Table 2.1.2)
2.2 Characteristics of Respondents
In the overall sense, the proportions of SAADP and control respondents based on groupings by type of livelihood show a similar pattern
The agricultural sector represents the main source of livelihood of SAADP households (84.8%) and also of control households (85.2%), as Table 2.2.1 shows
The most common agricultural undertakings are the cultivation of food crops and tree crops
Animal husbandry and marine fishing account for comparatively small numbers
The majority of farmers in both SAADP and control households also have other economic activities outside the agricultural sector
The average number of persons in sample households in each district ranges from 4.5 to 5.4
On the whole, the average number of persons per household is much the same in both SAADP and control households (see Table 2.2.2)
Furthermore, statistical testing shows that there is no significant difference between each group of households
The same table also shows that there is likewise very little difference between SAADP and control households in the average number of household members who have economic activities (1.4 and 1.3 persons respectively)
This applies to the overall number and is also true on a district basis
This too has been shown by statistitical testing to be the case
From the above data it can be said that in the broad sense attempts to select control villages and households with the same characteristics as SAADP villages and households were successful
Furthermore, statistical testing was done of household income and expenditure to ascertain whether similarity existed (see Chapter 8)
Results show that there is no statistical difference in the socioeconomic status of households in the two groupings
The conclusion can therefore be drawn that the control villages and households can be used in comparisons with the SAADP villages and households for purposes of estimating the net impact of the SAADP project
2.3 Respondents' Experiences in Obtaining Credit
SAADP Credit From a total of 408 respondent households, 436 household members have obtained SAADP credit
This indicates that the average number of household members who obtained SAADP credit is around one per household
Table 2.3.1 shows that in 93.6% of SAADP households there was only one borrower
The highest number of SAADP borrowers per household was three and this occurred only in Muna District, where the figure was 1.9% of households
From the year 2000 to the beginning of 2003, these 436 borrowers had obtained 557 SAADP loans, that is, on average each borrowed 1.3 times
The average frequency of borrowing per household was 1.4 times
The majority of households (71.8%) borrowed only once, while around 7.1% of households did so three or four times
The proportion of households that borrowed up to three times was greatest in Tolitoli (19.6%) followed by Muna (13.6%), as Table 2.3.2 shows
Persons with limited education, that is, those who had completed elementary school (SD) or less (57.6%), were on the whole able to gain access to SAADP credit
As Table 2.3.3 shows, SAADP borrowers were spread over all educational levels but most were persons who had completed SD or schooling of equivalent level
The same is found if figures for each district are examined, with the exception of Konsel District, borrowing was dominated by persons who had completed SD or the equivalent level
More than half of the persons who borrowed in Konsel District had completed junior high school (SMP) or higher
Most dominant were borrowers who had completed senior high school (SMU) or the equivalent or even a higher level of education, they amounted to 36.5%
The greatest number of SAADP borrowers who had no schooling was in Muna District (15.8%) whereas in the other three districts the figure was less than 3%
Non-SAADP Credit During the 1999-2004 period the numbers of SAADP and control households that at some time obtained non-SAADP credit were 16.2% and 19.5% respectively
The highest proportion was among control households in Muna (32.7%) while the lowest was among control households in Tolitoli (3.9%)
There was a tendency for more households in South-east Sulawesi than in Central Sulawesi to obtain non-SAADP credit
On the whole, the proportions that obtained non-SAADP credit in SAADP households and control households were relatively balanced (see Table 2.3.4)
In the 66 SAADP households that received non-SAADP credit, there were 68 borrowers
While in the 41 control households that received non-SAADP credit there were 41 borrowers
Thus in both SAADP and control households that obtained non- SAADP credit, generally only one household member borrowed
The number of loans obtained by these borrowers was 90 in SAADP households and 55 in control households
Most households (78.8% of SAADP households and 78.1% of control households) obtained a loan only once
There was no great difference in the frequency with which credit was obtained between SAADP and control households, as Table 2.3.5 shows
A distinction can be made between the sources of non-SAADP credit to which SAADP and control households have had access
These sources include banks, cooperatives, government programs, and informal credit providers
The banks that have extended credit to respondents are the BRI (Bank Rakyat Indonesia or the Indonesian People's Bank), the BPD (Bank Pembangunan Daerah or Regional Development Bank), the BTN (Bank Tabungan Negara or State Savings Bank) and Mandiri Bank
As can be seen from Table 2.3.6, the credit source that is most often accessed by SAADP households is a bank
This was found in all districts (38.9% of total non-SAADP loans)
Among control households in Donggala (46.6%)
While for SAADP households in Tolitoli, the credit source most commonly used, was government programs
In both Tolitoli and Konsel, there was not one member of the control households who obtained credit from a bank
Cooperatives are the main source of credit for control households in Muna and Konsel, but not one person in control households in Donggala and Tolitoli had borrowed from a cooperative
According to qualitative information, cooperatives in general no longer play a prominent role in these two districts in Central Sulawesi
In Donggala there is a Savings and Loans Cooperative that, prior to the establishment of the UPKD, was the only source of credit for the community, even though the interest rate was extremely high at 30 per cent per month
It seems that, apart from banks and government programs, households in Donggala prefer to borrow money from informal credit sources such as moneylenders, neighbors and relatives rather than from the cooperative
Meanwhile, government programs, especially those that include revolving credit such as the Subdistrict Development Program (PPK), are the main sources of credit for SAADP and control households in Tolitoli
PPK is also a government program credit source in all research locations
In Donggala, in addition to PPK there is also the Program for Economic Empowerment of Coastal Communities (PEMPP), which is conducted by the local Fisheries Service and takes the form of provision of ketinting engines for fishing boats
Fishermen purchase these engines on the installment system
In Muna District there is also a revolving fund cattle project that is conducted by the local Agricultural Service
Approximately 90 cattle have been lent to the community, with each household receiving up to four animals
Other alternative sources of credit for SAADP and control households specifically in Muna and Konsel are companies that provide credit for the purchase of motor-cycles
The credit is handled either directly by the motor-cycle dealer himself or else through a credit company that works together with the dealer
The amount of credit that can be obtained from a bank ranges from Rp1 million to Rp26 million
Loans from a cooperative, a government program or an informal source do not differ very much in size, being Rp50,000 to Rp5 million, Rp75,000 to Rp5 million and Rp60,000 to Rp6.75 million respectively
Where motor-cycles are bought through a credit arrangement, the range in price is from Rp10.7 million to Rp20.2 million
The interest rates charged by non-SAADP credit sources tend to be higher than SAADP rates
Some informal credit sources charge more than 30% per month
The purposes for which money is borrowed from a bank, cooperative or informal credit source do not differ very greatly
Loans are normally used to pay for house improvements or as capital for farming and trade
III A BRIEF PICTURE OF SAADP
3.1 Program Objectives, Design and Characteristics
The Sulawesi Agricultural Area Development Project (SAADP), which was carried out in the Provinces of Central and South-east Sulawesi, was implemented by the Indonesian Government with assistance from the World Bank in the form of a loan (Loan Agreement 4007-IND)
The project, which commenced in 1996, had the following objectives
To raise the income of farmers through improvement and expansion of farming systems involving food and tree crops, as well as development of livestock, fisheries and other economically productive undertakings;
To reduce gaps in income and welfare levels through assistance with the development of backward rural areas;
and To increase local government capacity and community participation in the development of economic undertakings among poor people
The program was initially designed for the development of agricultural areas
The activities that were undertaken included, among others, livestock distribution, the provision of agricultural inputs such as seed, the replication of dry-farming technology, intensification in the use of home-lots and construction/repair of agricultural infrastructure
Support was provided in the form of institutional strengthening and a component involving expansion of integrated farming systems that was handled by the Body for Agricultural Technology Research (Badan Pengkajian Teknologi Pertanian) in Central Sulawesi and South-east Sulawesi
The type of assistance that was provided depended on needs and on considerations expressed by related agencies
The results of the World Bank's Mid-term Review in January and February 1999, that is in the middle of the project implementation period, revealed that, since implementation was not very effective, target groups had experienced very little benefit
Furthermore, it appeared that the provision of micro credit was the activity most attractive to the community
For that reason an agreement was reached between the Directorate-General for Regional Development (Bangda) and the World Bank that from 1999 the focus of activities would be changed by combining a number previously separate project components into the Program for Local Community Initiatives (IMS)
This component consisted of four main sections, namely
Replication of farming systems (SUTA); Livestock development; Productive economic undertakings (UEP) and Infrastructure development to support the IMS program (P4-IMS)
Since that time SAADP has been better known, at least among regional governments, as IMS-SAADP
The new system, which placed emphasis on revolving credit activities, required a participative approach and intensive community involvement, which were provided through facilitators and field workers
The revolving funds were to be managed by the community through the Unit for Management of Village Activities/Finances (UPKD), which was formed by the village community with facilitation from the project
The main characteristics of IMS-SAADP as described in the Directions for Implementation and Guide to Technical Operation of IMS-SAADP (referred to as the juklak) were as follows
Proposals for the type of activity and the amount of funding were decided by the community itself, with support from the local Agricultural Extension Worker (PPL) and facilitator;
IMS funds were provided in the form of a lump sum to the district level
The amount of money that was channeled to each community group or institution was determined on a basis of group/village proposals;
IMS funds were channeled directly to the village level through a transfer of money to the bank account of the UPKD
UPKD then distributed the funds to farmers' or community groups;
The timetable for processing and channeling funds to the village level had to be adhered to and had to be in accordance with the standard procedure and format;
All supply activities were done by community groups and not through tenders;
Proposed activities that utilized credit had to be oriented towards self-reliant economic activities;
Credit management was strict (in the supervision of repayment) and was in nature commercial
3.2 Target Beneficiaries
The target beneficiaries in the IMS program were poor families or community groups, both male and female (widows or women who lived alone or conducted their own economic undertakings), in villages in the project locations
Priority in provision of program assistance was given to
Groups of poor people or poor farmers who had no source of income to meet their daily needs, especially food, education and health and other socioeconomic requirements; Groups of women and young people who were unemployed or did not have regular work;
Groups of people who were not currently participants or beneficiaries in another on-going project
Nevertheless, World Bank staff stated during a discussion with the SMERU research team at the time when preparations were being made for the evaluation study and early findings were presented in Jakarta, the above criteria were not applied because emphasis was on assisting persons who already had an economic activity
This was related to the nature of the program, which was not a social but rather an economic and commercial undertaking, since the money lent to the community was not a grant but had to be repaid
It can be assumed that, as a consequence of this approach, program beneficiaries did not constitute the poorest group in the community
3.3 Village Criteria and Allocation of Funds per Village
The villages that were selected to participate in the program were villages in the poor category
They were chosen by the provincial and district Coordinating Teams for Program Management (TKPP), which used the following criteria
Villages with a large number of poor people; Villages with dry/irrigated land that had the potential for development; Villages located within one area; and Villages with limited economic infrastructure
The ceilings for IMS funds were set at a minimum of Rp50 million and a maximum of Rp100 million per village
It was possible for villages that had already absorbed the maximum funds to receive further IMS funds, provided that UPKD performance was good and that there were proposals for activities that were suitable for funding
IMS funds were given to the village and were intended to become a village asset to be used for activities involving replication of farming systems (IMS-SUTA), IMS for livestock raising, productive economic undertakings (IMS-UEP) and infrastructure development (P4-IMS)
These funds were lent to community members who were formed into groups
Project Management Organization of the IMS-SAADP project involved the central level, with secretariats in Bangda, the province (Bappeda) and the district (Bappeda)
At the central level project organization placed emphasis on guidance that in nature involved overall control
At the provincial level emphasis was more on coordination in project implementation, while at the district level emphasis was on coordination among those implementing the IMS project
The related agencies at district level included Bappeda, PMD and government offices (dinas) that dealt with agriculture, animal husbandry, plantations, fisheries and marine activities, and public works
The village level organization was the core of IMS project implementation because the organization was created by the community through village meetings and recognized as legal by the village head
Village meetings represented the forum for gatherings of the whole village community to formulate, implement, monitor and evaluate activities
The organization that was formed was the UPKD, whose function was to handle financial management of the program and to undertake further expansion through coordination of the various financial sources at village level
It was hoped that this unit would become the embryo of a village financial institution
In order to maximize project implementation in the field, additional accompanying elements were included, consisting of consultants at provincial and district levels as well as facilitators who were recruited from local NGOs
The coordinators of facilitators were located at provincial and district levels, while the facilitators themselves and extension workers (PPL) were placed at village level
The role of consultants was, among other things, to provide technical assistance, suggestions and recommendations that were connected to various aspects of technical and general policies, to carry out project monitoring and evaluation, to make routine visits to villages in order to review UPKD financial reports while offering suggestions for improvements, and to assist the district-level Bappeda in coordinating activities, compiling project reports and selecting suitable proposals from among those that were submitted
Meanwhile, the role of the facilitators was, among other things, to help in the socialization process, to form community groups, to provide these groups with assistance in skills, financial management and technical management, to help community members undertake discussions to identify the activities that would be proposed, and, in conjunction with the PPL, to help in the preparation of proposals
3.5 The Implementation Mechanism
In the initial stage, socialization of the SAADP program was undertaken in a tiered manner from the central level, through the provincial and district levels, down to the village level
After the UPKD had been formed through village discussions and community members had formed groups, UPKD office-bearers, together with the heads of groups, facilitators and members of the village administration, then disseminated information about the program to the community in various ways
That included the placement of announcement boards, posters or brochures in several places such as the village meeting hall, the market, or close to places of worship
After the community groups were formed, members prepared proposals with the help of a facilitator
The proposals were then submitted to the UPKD for evaluation by the village verification team, which consisted of the chairman of the UPKD, the facilitator and the PPL
After this, a report was made to the village head of the proposals that met requirements so that a village meeting could be held to discuss, evaluate, and decide on the priority ranking of the proposals
The UPKD then compiled a recapitulation of all proposals that had been agreed to at the village meeting on a basis of ranking
The recapitulation of proposals was then forwarded on to the verification team at district level for evaluation
Results were immediately reported back to the UPKD management so that a Promissory Letter for Funds (SP2D) could be prepared and signed by the UPKD chairman and the cluster manager responsible for the subdistrict in question, and legalized by the head of the economic section in the district-level Bappeda
The types of activities, the amount of money, the period for implementation and the nature of the loan were stated in the SP2D
Using these SP2Ds as the basis, the cluster manager withdrew funds from the KPKN and directed them to the bank account of the UPKD
The UPKD then passed these funds on to the community groups in the form of revolving loans with regulations which had been agreed upon at a community discussion but which observed certain standard regulations such as a minimum interest rate of 15% per year
IV THE PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS
4.1 The Implementation Teams
As described in the juklak, a Program Management Coordination Team (the Provincial TKPP) was formed at provincial level to coordinate activities by the various agencies involved in SAADP implementation
In the same way a district-level TKPP was established in each district, including the four sample districts
The secretariats of the provincial and district TKPPs were attached to each provincial and district level Bappeda
The agencies represented in the TKPPs included, among others, Bappeda and related government offices (Dinas) like the Food Crop Office and the Plantations Office
In addition, consultants and coordinators of facilitators, whose task was to assist the TKPPs so that SAADP field implementation could be handled in an optimum way, were recruited at both provincial and district levels
At district level, coordinators were appointed to be in charge of several cluster managers
One cluster manager was normally appointed for several subdistricts, but in Donggala District each cluster manager had tasks in only two subdistricts
4.2 Socialization
According to project managers at provincial and district levels, socialization of SAADP was done in a tiered manner from provincial down to village level
Socialization at provincial level was carried out in Kendari and Palu and was attended by related agencies at provincial and district levels, non-government organizations, and representatives from universities
Socialization at district level was undertaken by each district with participants from the related government offices, the heads of subdistricts, officials from Village Community Development (PMD) and Agricultural Extension Workers (PPL)
Socialization was then carried out at the village level where, on the whole, it was undertaken more than once
On the first occasion, facilitators, the village head and his staff, community figures, religious figures, and members of the community were present
In addition, members of the district-level TKPP, cluster managers, and consultants attended
Most of the material, which was presented by facilitators, consisted of a general explanation of the project and covered the project purpose and objectives, the availability of funds that could be borrowed by the community to develop economic undertakings, and the requirements and criteria for participants
On the second occasion, socialization was usually attended only by relevant parties at village level, including members of the community and facilitators, and basically represented a village meeting to select the UPKD management
In a number of villages, socialization was also undertaken through announcements in mosques at the time of Friday prayers or by putting posters about SAADP in strategic locations such as the market and the UPKD office
Besides these approaches, facilitators and even the UPKD continued socialization of SAADP, although not in a specific manner
This was done, among other ways, through the formation forum and community group discussions
The material presented was related to details of SAADP credit implementation, such as the borrowing mechanism, the interest rate, and repayment
Although, according to explanations from project managers, socialization was undertaken through direct meetings with the community, only around 59.6% of respondents stated that they obtained their initial information about SAADP at a gathering or meeting
Approximately 28.4% said that they had heard about SAADP during informal conversations with friends or neighbors, while 10.8% said their source of information was an oral announcement (see Table 4.2.1)
On the whole, members of the community who attended the SAADP socialization said that they had been invited or told about it by the head of their hamlet, by the head of their neighborhood (RT), by neighbors, or directly by the facilitator
In cases where socialization was done after the selection of the UPKD management, some people were told directly by the chosen UPKD office-holders
The constraint most frequently encountered by project managers and village officials at the time of socialization was that not all members of the community wanted to attend when they were invited to a village meeting
People who did not attend the socialization meeting usually obtained information only from friends or neighbors who had been present
This meant that the information passed on to the community was limited to general matters such as the availability of credit and the need to form groups
The whole process of giving people an understanding of the loan mechanism and the credit scheme had to be repeated by the UPKD office-holders when the loans were distributed
The way in which socialization is handled can undoubtedly influence the overall success of a project
The understanding of project objectives and targets by those responsible for implementation, especially at the grassroots level, can affect individual performances
A case that occurred in one subdistrict in Konsel District illustrates the point
The explanation given by a facilitator that SAADP funds were a grant led to the perception on the part of the community that the money did not have to be returned
4.3 SAADP Participants
Selection Criteria and Process According to the juklak, SAADP participants are poor community groups with priority given to poor people or farmers and to women and young people who are unemployed or who do not have regular work and who are not currently beneficiaries in an on-going project
In the initial stage of implementation the criterion of poor community groups was applied in selecting SAADP participants in all sample villages, although not very strictly
On the whole, the people who became participants were relatively poor families who worked as food-crop farmers or tree-crop smallholders, fishermen, owner/managers of household industries, construction workers, drivers and traders
Many of them were classified as preprosperous families according to BKKBN criteria
As the project proceeded, the repayment of loans by participants whose main source of livelihood was farming did not perform smoothly
The reasons were, among others, that their agricultural output could barely meet the family's daily needs and that a decrease in harvests had occurred
The length of time for installments of loan repayments, which was usually adjusted to the growing season (4 to 6 months), was thought to be a further reason
The length of time between installments meant that the participant had to pay a rather large amount of money in one go or else in two installments, which in turn affected his willingness to pay
For these reasons, the granting of credit in the next or revolving stage was focused more on those persons who were considered capable of repaying the loan
Ultimately, people involved in trade became the main target because they had a daily income, which enabled them to repay loans in a regular manner every month
Furthermore, in a number of villages public servants (PNS), who at the beginning of the project had not been allowed to participate, were permitted to do so during the following stage
The reason was that they had a fixed income and could repay installments regularly
In actual fact, even at the beginning of the project, public servants had obtained loans either secretly by using the name of a family member or openly on the excuse that they could provide a good example to other participants in the repayment of loans
Table 4.3.1 shows that, according to their own admission, the majority of household respondents (83.6%) were able to become SAADP participants because they owned an economic undertaking
Only 16.7% said they were eligible because they were poor
According to the World Bank in discussions with SMERU, the focus on persons who owned an economic undertaking was correct because SAADP was not a social program but rather one that was economic and commercial in nature
Table 4.3.2 shows respondents evaluation of the welfare status of community groups who obtained SAADP loans
Most SAADP households (85.1%) believed that the majority of SAADP beneficiaries were middle class and low-income households while only 5.4% said that beneficiaries were the wealthy in the village concerned
The same trend was found among control households in SAADP villages, that is those who lived in SAADP villages but did not receive SAADP loans
Approximately 68.5% of these respondents said that the majority of SAADP beneficiaries were middle class and low-income households, while only 11.2% said that SAADP beneficiaries belonged to the wealthy group in the village community
Community evaluation of transparency and justice in the selection of participants is shown in Table 4.3.3
Around 67.7% of SAADP respondents said that the selection was done in a transparent and fair manner
If these two variables are differentiated, 79.5% of SAADP households stated that the selection of participants was done in a transparent way and 86.1% said that it was done fairly
They assessed the selection process in this way because it was done openly, especially at the beginning of project implementation, and because all who met the requirements and were interested in submitting a proposal had the same opportunity to become participants
In cases where available funds were limited, those who were first to submit proposals were given priority in receiving loans
Meanwhile, only 26.7% of respondents who were not participants but who lived in SAADP villages said that the selection of SAADP participants was done transparently and fairly
Even so, 58.9% said that selection was transparent and 63.4% said that it was fair
According to the regulations, SAADP participants had to be people living within the village that received SAADP assistance
This stipulation was generally observed very strictly
In a few places some applicants were asked to bring a statement from the village head that they really were residents of that village
Even so, UPKD managers in one of the sample villages in Muna admitted that there were borrowers who came from a neighboring village that did not receive SAADP because these persons were able to return the loan without any trouble
Also they lived so close that they just had to cross the road to the sample village
The selection process in the early stage of implementation differed from the process in the revolving stage
In the beginning, selection of participants was based on selection of credit proposals submitted through a group
Thus the selection process was basically not decided individually
In accordance with the explanation given during socialization, participants who submitted requests for loans were generally not wealthy people and not public servants
Not all submissions from community groups could be accepted, however, because funds were limited
Furthermore, since the release of funds by the government was done in stages, not all groups received their loans at the same time
Decisions about which groups would receive the loans first was usually based on a scale of priorities that had already been fixed at the time when the UPKD put in a request for funds to the district
In one village in Muna, however, these decisions were made on a lottery basis
The selection process at the revolving stage varied from one region to another and generally depended very much on the subjective considerations of UPKD managers
On the whole, the first consideration of the UPKD was regularity in repayments, which meant that loans were given to community members who were regarded as capable of repaying the money
4.4 The Implementation Mechanism The Credit Proposal Process
According to the regulations, proposals for SAADP loans had to be submitted through community groups
At the beginning of the project this process was followed rather consistently
At this stage members of the community formed groups or were put into groups by the UPKD, after which the proposals were put forward through the group
According to respondents' statements, which were supported by UPKD information, at the revolving stage, when funds were distributed in the following budget year (if the village obtained an additional SAADP quota), the group was set up only as a formality to meet project requirements at the time of proposal submissions
Usually people put forward their proposal to the UPKD managers and were then arranged into groups by the UPKD for purposes of reporting or recording
It can be seen from Table 4.4.1 that the majority of loan proposals (76.0%) were submitted through groups
While only 23.6% were submitted by the individual concerned or given directly to the UPKD
This information, however, does not reveal the present situation for submission of proposals because the data referred to include all loans that the respondent has ever received
The majority of proposals submitted through groups were first loans that were put forward at the beginning of the project
Requests for SAADP loans should be in the form of a written proposal
But as with the group requirement, this was done only at the beginning of the project
In the following stage, requests were generally made orally to the UPKD managers
Then, in some cases the UPKD office-holders reframed the request into a written proposal
In most instances, however, it was sufficient for the borrower to write his name on the list of persons who were submitting requests for loans
Table 4.4.2 shows that of the 557 SAADP loans that were received by respondents, only 383 loans (68.8%) were submitted in the form of a written proposal and of these the majority were loans that had been requested at the beginning of the project
In terms of the person who actually prepared the proposal, around 34.7% of the 383 proposals were made by the UPKD office-holders, 27.4% were made by the head of the group and only 22.5% were made by members of the group
A rather high proportion of proposals was prepared by UPKD office-holders, one of the reasons being that many UPKDs felt that it would be hard to expect the local community to prepare proposals themselves, because on the whole, educational levels are low
The UPKD managers therefore chose to prepare the proposals themselves (usually with the assistance of the facilitator) rather than try to teach participants how to do it
Proposals that had been prepared by individuals were given to the head of the group to be summarized and then passed on to the UPKD
Proposals prepared by the head of the group on a basis of submissions from group members were first signed by the members before they were submitted to the UPKD
In a number of villages the facilitator and the Agricultural Extension Worker (PPL) helped with the proposal-making process at the level of groups and the preparation of a recapitulation
The proposals submitted to the UPKD were then verified by the village verification team, which consisted of the UPKD chairman, the facilitator, and the PPL
In a few villages the village head and members of his staff were included in the team
In one village in Tolitoli District, the village head actually played the central role
In this village, the UPKD management usually waited for the village head's agreement before they passed on credit to anyone
Additional Requirements The SAADP project did not set any other requirements because the loans were designed as credit to which the village community would have easy access
For that reason, the UPKD generally did not impose further conditions at the commencement of project implementation
After the project had been running for some time and there proved to be serious delays in loan repayments, however, the UPKD realized that there was need for a formulation and agreement about this matter as one way to solve the problem of repayments that were in arrears
Since there were no standard regulations that could be referred to, the additional requirements that were introduced differed from one sample village to another
Usually the UPKD management decided on the requirements but in some cases they were the outcome of an agreement with the community or with village authorities and community figures
They were usually formulated to suit the needs and conditions of each region and included, for example, a statement of assets such as land, agricultural produce, a boat, a boat engine, livestock, or electronic goods, as collateral, a letter of information from the village head, a land certificate, proof of payment of the land and buildings tax (PBB), a photocopy of the borrower's Identification Card (KTP), and a photocopy of the Family Card (KK)
Most of these additional requirements did not generally apply to all persons in the village who wanted to obtain a loan but rather only to those who were judged to be unreliable in the repayment of credit
From Table 4.4.3 it can be seen that the majority (61.3%) of SAADP loans did not have to be accompanied by any kind of document or letter at the time when the proposal was submitted
Some 27.6% of loans were accompanied by a statement of guarantee for a certain asset and 10.1% of loans had a KTP photocopy attached
There were also several SAADP loans that were accompanied by collateral in the form of valuable documents of the type that banks will accept, namely, land certificates (3.6%) and vehicle ownership papers (BPKB) (0.2%)
If the two sample provinces are compared, it appears that additional requirements were more commonly imposed in Central Sulawesi than in South-east Sulawesi
If the purpose in setting additional requirements, in particular those that took the form of assets as collateral, was to ensure repayment of loans, there should have been sanctions of some kind when repayment was delayed, for example, confiscation of the assets that formed the guarantee
According to information from UPKD managers, however, this requirement was intended to have only a psychological effect or to frighten borrowers so that they would repay their loans promptly
When in fact repayments were in arrears, the UPKD never confiscated the collateral and preferred to settle the matter in a family spirit
Confiscation of an asset in the form of land was found in only one sample village in Donggala, but in this instance the problem was not a delay in loan repayment but rather the embezzlement of money by the UPKD chairman
Distribution of Loans After the proposals were approved, the UPKD distributed the funds to participants
At the beginning of project implementation, the loans were sometimes passed on directly to the participant but sometimes distribution was done through groups
At the revolving stage almost all loans were given directly to the borrower
Loan transactions were completed when each borrower signed a statement that he/she had received a SAADP loan
The length of time from when the participant submitted his/her proposal to the time when he/she received the money from the UPKD varied somewhat, depending on the financial position of the UPKD
At the beginning of the project the UPKD's financial position was influenced by the length of time taken for money to be channeled from the government, while at the revolving staged it depended on how well loan installments were being repaid by borrowers
In general, the release of loans was relatively quick, as can be seen from Table 4.4.4
Approximately 63.3% of loans took one month or less
While 35.0% took more than one month
Distribution of loans in the early stage of the project took longer because project funds were released in three installments every three months
In the revolving stage, the time was much shorter
If the UPKD had funds available, a borrower could make a request and receive the loan on the same day, especially if he/she had a good track record in repaying credit
The Credit Scheme The size of loans also varied from one borrower to another both within the same village and between villages, with range from Rp200,000 to Rp5,000,000
In the early stage these decisions were made by the verification team, that is the UPKD chairman, the facilitator and the PPL, usually with the involvement of the village head
However, at the revolving stage, commonly was decided by the UPKD, 
The considerations that were used in decisions about the size of the loan were the participant's proposal and ability to repay the loan and the availability of funds in the UPKD office
Table 4.4.5 shows that, on the whole, most loans (39%) were between Rp500,000 and Rp1,000,000
Participants whose livelihood was farming usually received smaller loans than those who had some other kind of economic undertaking, especially in trade
This is apparent from the fact that the proportion of loans for farming becomes smaller as the size of loans increases
On the other hand, for trade and livestock activities, the larger the loan the larger the proportion
Most loans in the range from Rp200,000 to Rp 500,000 and from Rp500,000 to Rp1,000,000 went to borrowers for agricultural purposes, namely, 49.2% and 35.3% of loans respectively
Loans in the range from Rp 1,000,000 to Rp2,000,000 and from Rp2,000,000 to Rp5,000,000 were given to borrowers for trading activities, that is, 39.4% and 47.8% respectively
Farmers said that the size of the loans they received was relatively small by comparison with their farming needs
Qualitative information indicates that larger loans were also given to public servants, village officials, and participants who had a close connection with UPKD office-holders
Table 4.4.6 shows that the amount of most SAADP loans (66.3%) were in fact the same as the amount proposed
Around 32.3% were smaller and only 1.4% were larger than the amount that had been requested
If a comparison is made of the two sample provinces, more cases of actual loans being smaller than the proposed amount occurred more frequently in South-east Sulawesi (46.6% of loans)
The figure in Konsel District was as high as 68.6% of loans
Meanwhile, if the proposed activity is considered, it can be seen that, while the size of loans for use as farming capital (45.4%) was smaller than proposed amounts, the proportion was higher than loans for trade purposes (19.7%) (See Appendix Table 4.1)
In connection with interest on loans, the SAADP credit was designed as commercial credit on which interest had to be paid
According to the juklak, the community decides the rate at a village meeting but the minimum is 15% per year
In actual implementation, the interest rate on loans was decided at a meeting between the UPKD management, the cluster manager, the project leader, and facilitators at district level
After this meeting a discussion with people in each village was normally conducted
The purpose of this discussion, however, was really to pass on the decision made at district level because members of the community usually just agreed with what they were told
In the first year of implementation after the project had been redesigned, that is in 1999/2000, the village generally agreed to set the interest at 15%, this being the amount stated in the juklak
In later years, however, the rate rose to 18% and even 24% per year
Qualitative information indicated that the interest rate was raised on a recommendation from UPKD officeholders in connection with the low honoraria that they received from interest on loans
The low honorarium was one of the reasons why many of these office-holders resigned
Hence it seemed that the best way out of the problem was to increase the interest
In a number of cases, decisions about interest rates were not carried out very strictly
For example, in one of the sample villages in Donggala, the interest rate was reduced from the original 18% to 15% per year for borrowers who were having difficulty in repaying installments of their loans for technical reasons
Table 4.4.7 shows that on the whole most SAAD loans (91.9%) had interest charges of between 15% and 24% per year
This was the range in all sample villages from the beginning of the project up to the present time
Only 1.4% of loans had an interest rate under 15%, while interest of more than 24% per year was imposed on only 4.3% of loans
The fact that some had less than 15% while some had more than 24% interest is probably explained by the fact that some loans were fully repaid more quickly or more slowly than the period fixed for repayment
Quite a number of respondents did not know what percentage interest rate they were paying on their loans
They only knew the amount of interest that they had to pay in the form of nominal value, the size of which remained the same irrespective of whether they paid off the loan more quickly or more slowly than agreed
If this were converted to percentages, the borrower who repaid his loan more quickly would have paid a higher annual interest rate
On the whole, the repayment period for loans was set at one year at the most
The period and frequency of installment payments varied, depending on the type of economic activity stated by the participant in his loan submission
Loans for activities outside agriculture usually required an installment to be paid monthly, but in the case of agricultural undertakings installments were paid in accordance with harvest times, which generally meant once in three to six months
At the beginning of project implementation, participants paid installments in two ways, either directly to the UPKD or else through the head of the group
In the next stage, that is the second year when funds were able to revolve, the majority of participants paid the money directly to the UPKD
There were several reasons why they chose this method
i) the head of the group had previously kept some of the money; 
ii) the head of the group had asked the UPKD office-holders for an incentive for his services;
iii) participants were worried that the head of the group would not pass the money on to the UPKD;
and iv) the head of the group objected to having the burden of passing on the installments from participants
Nevertheless, there are still a small number of participants who even now repay their loans through the group
The Giving of Incentives by Respondents In the program juklak, there are no regulations about the payment of incentives by borrowers to any one, apart from interest
All administrative and operational costs involved in project implementation were taken from a section of project funds in the first year and after that they were taken from the interest paid on loans
This is in keeping with the statements of some 90.7% of respondents in all sample villages that they had never given an incentive (a service fee) to anyone whatsoever, whether UPKD officeholders or village officials (see Table 4.4.8)
Only 9.1% of respondents said that they had given incentives (always or sometimes)
Around 4.7% of respondents stated that they did so voluntarily, while 2.9% said that they did so because the UPKD management asked them for an incentive
In addition, a number of respondents in one village in Tolitoli District said that the village head had cut between Rp17,500 and Rp37,500 from every loan and that they had never received any explanation of what the money was used for
In one village in Konsel District a respondent was charged Rp3,000 by the UPKD as the cost of preparing his proposal
4.5 The Group System
Groups were usually formed at the early stage in SAADP implementation in order to meet the project requirement that loans had to be distributed through a system of groups
On the whole, members of the community knew that SAADP assistance would be given to them through groups
The initiative and basis for formation of groups, however, varied from region to region
The first type of group was formed at the initiative of the community
Groups in this category generally looked for members who had similar economic activities or who lived close by, such as farmers and fishermen
The head of the group was then chosen by the members
The second type of group involved the selection of a group head by the UPKD and that person then went looking for members for the group
With the third type, the group was formed directly by the UPKD office-holders
At the beginning of implementation the facilitator usually assisted the UPKD with the formation of groups
This was generally done at the time when proposals for loans were submitted based on similarity in type of economic undertakings
At the revolving stage group formation was more frequently decided by the UPKD on the basis of similarity in the date when funds were released
The formation of groups at this stage was done at the time when participants received their loans from the UPKD management but the groups existed only on paper
Some participants realized that they had been formed into groups while many were not aware of the fact
As shown in Table 4.4.1 in section 4.4 above, 422 loan proposals (76%) were submitted through groups
From the point of view of initiative in formation of the group, there are wide variations, as Table 4.5.1 indicates
A large number of loans (48.8%) were submitted through groups formed at the initiative of the UPKD
Around 32.7% were submitted through groups formed at the initiative of the community or participants themselves, and only 6.2% were submitted by existing groups that had been formed previously
The formation of most groups was based on similarity in economic activities (86% of loans), as can be seen from Table 4.5.2
This was found in all sample districts
In other cases the basis of group formation was proximity in the location of houses, proximity in location of economic activities, and family relationships
In practice, groups functioned only at the beginning of the project, at the time when proposals for initial loans were submitted
At the time when the loans were available, the managers of the UPKD asked the heads of groups and their members to come together to receive the money or else they handed the money over to heads of groups for distribution to their members
At the beginning of the project, some of the participants who had received their loan through the head of the group repaid installments through the group also
As noted in section 4.3 above, at the next stage when funds were revolving, most borrowers preferred to pay installments direct to the UPKD
For this reason the groups did not continue to function
In reality, the philosophy underlying the formation of groups in most government projects is that participants can share knowledge and experiences in order to expand their own individual undertakings
It was hoped that, with the assistance of facilitators, the group system would enable participants to obtain a better understanding of the project and to draw up a list of priorities in the activities put forward in their proposals
It had also been expected that the PPLs would be able to help solve technical aspects of the agricultural problems faced by participants
But at field level the reality was somewhat different
Groups were formed basically only to meet project requirements, the role of facilitators was directed more toward assistance for the UPKDs, and the PPLs played a part only as members of the verification team
For these reasons relatively effective groups were found only in certain villages and even then in very small numbers
V THE UPKD SYSTEM
5.1 The UPKD Formation Process Involvement of Respondents
Not all respondents knew about or were involved in the UPKD formation process
In fact, there were respondents who were somewhat uncertain about the source of the loan that they had received and who had handled it
Only 58.8% of the 408 SAADP household respondents said that they understood the process by which the UPKD had been established (see Table 5.1.1)
The proportion was much higher in the Province of South-east Sulawesi (70.6%) than in the Province of Central Sulawesi (47.1%)
Donggala District had the smallest number of respondents who knew about the UPKD formation process (43%), while the proportions in the other districts were somewhat higher, with 51% in Tolitoli, 71% in Muna and 70% in Konsel
This indicates that socialization in the sample districts had not been entirely successful and that it had not reached all levels in the community that formed the project target
On the whole, involvement in UPKD formation meant being present at the village discussion forum and at the same time taking part in the selection process, according to 46.1% of respondents
Appointment of the UPKD Management Although not all respondents knew about or were directly involved in UPKD formation, the process nevertheless basically followed the instructions for program implementation
Some 92.9% of the 240 SAADP household respondents who stated that they knew about the process said that UPKD management was decided at a village discussion forum in which the community was involved, that is, a community discussion
On the other hand, 7.1% said that the UPKD was formed through a meeting of village officials or that office-holders were appointed directly by those officials (see Table 5.1.2)
Interviews with village officials and UPKD managers in each of the sample villages supported the above data
On the whole, the UPKD, as the institution that would handle revolving SAADP funds at village level, was formed in 1999 through a village discussion forum
The forum was attended by the village community, village officials, community figures, facilitators, subdistrict representatives and project leaders at district level
On this occasion those who were present, especially members of the community, chose the UPKD office-holders from among a number of persons who were recommended by the community itself
They felt that the formation process and the selection of office-holders had gone very well and had been quite transparent
5.2 UPKD Management Criteria
Information from village officials and UPKD office-holders in all sample villages indicated that candidates had to be residents of the village and had to have at least a Senior High School (SMA) education
It was expected that candidates would have no trouble in absorbing training material about bookkeeping, would be capable of handling money, would have a broad outlook and would have the confidence to speak in public
In addition to these requirements, there were other criteria that differed from village to village
For example, in one village in Tolitoli, UPKD candidates had to have experience in smallholder tree-crops or in animal husbandry and at the same time had to have their own private vehicle to facilitate the work of the UPKD
In a village in Muna, UPKD office-holders had to be representative of the existing hamlet-based pattern of ethnic groups
Thus the UPKD chairman was chosen from the Muna ethnic group, the treasurer from the Javanese ethnic group, and the secretary from the Balinese ethnic group
The purpose in choosing persons with different ethnic backgrounds was to make coordination and communications among the community easier
According to qualitative information, there was great variation in the backgrounds of UPKD office-holders as individuals both between villages and within the same village
Most of these people were ordinary members of the community but some had previously been prominent community figures
This is supported by data from respondents shown in Table 5.2.1
Most SAADP respondents (68.1%) said that the UPKD management consisted of ordinary members of the community while 31.1% of respondents said that UPKD office-holders were community figures
Although information in a number of villages indicated that village officials were not permitted to be UPKD office-holders and the basic design of the SAADP project itself sought to minimize interference from village officials, nevertheless a case was found where a village official was a member of the UPKD management, even though he was not the chairman
Data show that 11% of SAADP respondents stated that UPKD management in their village included village officials
Reference to the program juklak indicates that UPKD management should consist of a small group of between three and five persons
At the beginning of project implementation, the number of persons in several villages was four or five and consisted of a chairman, secretary/collector of installments, a treasurer, a person in charge of economic activities, and another responsible for physical activities
Not long after the UPKDs began to function, however, the number of office-holders was usually reduced to three, that is a chairman, a secretary and a treasurer
This structure is still found in almost all sample districts with the exception of Muna
In this district UPKD management generally consists of only one person, namely the chairman
The other office-holders have either resigned or are no longer active because they felt that their honorarium was too small
So far the UPKD chairman and the village head have made no attempt to replace the persons who resigned or became non-active
The program juklak states that the UPKD management must be re-elected after three years
In reality, however, this regulation has rarely been applied, even though several sample villages have already passed the three-year period
The reasons are, among others, that the community and the UPKD have given no attention to the matter, that they are unaware of the existence of this regulation, or that it is difficult to find people who have the capacity and are willing to replace the current management
Nevertheless, there are a number of UPKDs in which the chairman, secretary and treasurer have been replaced
The reason for their replacement, however, was not compliance with regulations, but because they were busy with other activities, were considered incapable of handling finances, lacked authority especially in collecting loan repayments from community members, were relatively inactive or suffered from poor health
There were also cases where office-holders (in many cases the UPKD chairman) were replaced because they had misused funds, that is they did not deposit installments paid by participants or else they embezzled SAADP funds
Cases of this kind were found in Tolitoli, Donggala, and Konsel Districts
The ability of UPKD office-holders to work together is an important element in program success
Several cases suggest that the lack of harmony within the UPKD has had a negative impact on effective revolving of funds
In one village in Konsel, for example, several UPKD office-holders resigned at the time when funds were released because they felt that the UPKD chairman completely dominated proceedings
After only one person was in charge, there was no control over the distribution of funds and cases of misuse of money occurred
The same happened in a village in Tolitoli, where the chairman did not include the other office-holders in matters relating to the release of funds but expected them to do the administrative work
Since there was no control, the chairman took the money that had been returned by community members as repayment of their loans
Evaluation of the Performance of the UPKD Management From Table 5.2.2 it can be seen that most SAADP household respondents (71.3%) believe that UPKD office-holders had the ability to handle the UPKD
The same trend was found in all four sample districts, with the highest proportion in Donggala (85.3% of respondents) and the lowest in Konsel (50.5%)
Meanwhile, a certain proportion (23.8%) said that UPKD office-holders were either not fully competent or else quite incompetent in handling the UPKD
The highest proportion was in Konsel (44.6% of respondents) and the lowest in Donggala (9.8%)
This evaluation by respondents of the ability of UPKD office-holders is consistent with qualitative information about UPKD development
UPKDs in Donggala were more successful in distributing and collecting loans than UPKDs in the other sample districts
At the same time, the sample UPKDs in Konsel had a relatively higher rate of non-repayment of credit than those in other districts
When asked why UPKD office-holders were not really competent in handling the UPKD, 34% of the respondents said that the reason was insufficient assistance and training (see Table 5.2.3)
This reason was given by most respondents in Tolitoli (42.1%)
Most respondents in Muna (39.1%) said that the management lacked expertise
While most respondents in Donggala and Konsel (40% in each district) gave other reasons that included unfairness, dishonesty, excessive activities and inability to communicate with the community
Meanwhile, the majority (66.4%) of SAADP household respondents said that the service provided by the UPKD to participants was good, while 20.6% of respondents felt that it was adequate and only 9.3% felt that it was poor (see Table 5.2.4)
The data in this table strengthens information presented in Table 5.2.3, namely that the sample UPKDs in Donggala displayed a relatively better level of performance than those in the other sample districts, especially if a comparison is made with sample UPKDs in Konsel
The majority (80.4%) of respondents in Donggala, which had the highest proportion among the four districts, judged the service provided by the UPKD as good
The smallest proportion of respondents who were satisfied with UPKD service occurred in Konsel (53.5%)
5.3 Decisions about Internal UPKD Regulations
According to qualitative information, decisions about internal UPKD regulations and the credit mechanism were made at district level during a meeting of a number of related parties that included UPKD office-holders, cluster managers, district project leaders, and facilitators, and were based on the program juklak
Decisions were then presented and discussed at a community discussion at village level to reach agreement
Although generally community members simply agreed to the regulations passed down from the district level, they felt that they were involved in decision-making at village level
Table 5.3.1 shows that 42.7% of SAADP respondents believed that the village community played a role in decision-making about internal UPKD regulations and the credit mechanism 
While another 51.5% of respondents said that the UPKD management had played a role in decision-making
The greatest number of respondents who said that the UPKD management had played a role in decision-making occurred in Tolitoli (70.6%)
While the greatest number who felt that the village community had played a role in this matter was found in Konsel (65.4%)
Around a quarter (25.7%) of all respondents said that they did not know who had played a role in decision-making
The types of regulations in which decisions involved the village community, as stated by 42.7% of SAADP respondents, varied somewhat, as can be seen from Table 5.3.2
Of those who stated that the community played a role in decision-making, 69.5% said that the community was involved in agreements about the length of time for which money could be borrowed, while 64.4% of respondents also said that the community was involved in decisions about the interest rate on loans
Other decisions that involved the community concerned sanctions, according to 49.4% of respondents
At the same time the community played a very small role in decision-making about internal UPKD regulations such as operational costs and honoraria for UPKD officeholders (only 9.2% and 12.6% respectively)
This can be traced to the fact that internal regulations of this kind were normally decided at district level and were in keeping with project regulations
At the time when project loans were distributed, the honorarium paid to the UPKD management was 5% of the SAADP funds received in each village
After the revolving stage was reached, the honorarium for the UPKD was 20% of the interest paid by borrowers
In reality, however, the percentage of the interest that formed this honorarium varied from one village to another
Thus the amount of interest that was left as the income of UPKD office-holders depended very much on the skill of the UPKD office-holders in managing expenditure, including dealing with requests for money from the village office and the community
In a number of villages where the UPKD is still functioning, requests from the village office and the community are in nature incidental and are not related to the amount of interest that is received
The UPKD work mechanism varies from village to village
In Donggala, each of the UPKDs in the sample villages has had a fixed work schedule
The UPKD in one village provided services for borrowers every Wednesday and Saturday, while the UPKD in another village did the same on Fridays and Saturdays
The UPKD in the third village allowed time every Tuesday and Friday for old customers but provided services only once a month on the second day of the month for new borrowers
By contrast, the UPKDs in Muna did not have special times for borrowers, which meant that borrowers and prospective borrowers came at any time to the home of the UPKD chairman
5.4 The Reporting and Supervisory System The Reporting System
The directions for SAADP implementation require a reporting system to be carried out at different levels
The UPKD, with the assistance of the facilitator, makes a monthly report about developments in activities, including bookkeeping and the repayment of loans, to the project leader and the cluster manager
The facilitators also make their own monthly and three monthly reports for the project leader and the district TKPP
Reports from the district TKPPs are sent to the provincial TKPP every month
After these reports are consolidated, a quarterly report is prepared for the central level (Bangda)
This report is then forwarded on to the World Bank and other related agencies
Both regional governments and UPKD office-holders said that the reporting system was effective while the project was still running
Reports were also presented at village meetings that were attended by the UPKD management, facilitators, cluster managers, heads of groups and village officials
Sometimes the UPKD sent a copy of its reports to the village and subdistrict offices
Approximately six months before the project ended, that is at the time when facilitators were no longer employed (June 2003), reporting activities, particularly in Konsel and Muna Districts, ceased
Although reporting is still done in Tolitoli and Donggala, it is no longer a routine procedure
According to UPKD office-holders, the reason is that they do not know whether the UPKD still has to report on its activities
Also, they do not know how the report should be prepared and to whom it should be submitted
According to UPKDs in sample villages in Konsel District, the biggest problem that they encountered in the SAADP reporting system was the frequency of disagreements between consultants, project leaders/cluster managers, and facilitators about the regulations that applied and the way of managing finances
As a result the UPKD had to make reports that differed
UPKD Reports to the Community One of the basic principles in the SAADP project is transparency, which means that all groups in the community must know about the handling of activities from the initial planning and implementation stages to continuity in credit opportunities at the revolving stage
Attempts to ensure transparency were to be undertaken through socialization during village discussions that were attended by all groups in the community and through the conducting of regular gatherings where the UPKD could report on its own developments
Thus the UPKD had to be managed in an open manner so that the community would know for certain what developments had occurred and what the financial position of the UPKD was at any time
One means by which the community could learn about how the UPKD was handling finances was preparation of a report about activities, including details of bookkeeping and the repayment of funds
From statements made by the majority of respondents, it is apparent that UPKD management was not transparent since only 34.4% of respondents said that there was or had once been information that the community could access about the financial position of the UPKD (see Table 5.4.1)
Some 38.7 % of respondents said that there had never been any reporting and 27% did not know whether there had been or not
Almost all respondents in Muna (91.3%) said that there had never been any reports and that they did not know of the existence of UPKD financial reports
By contrast, only 18.6% of Donggala respondents gave this answer
According to respondents who said that UPKD reports, accessible to the community, existed or had once existed, the reports were presented in the form of a report book, a single-sheet pamphlet, oral announcements at meetings, or an announcement on the UPKD's notice-board
As shown in Table 5.4.2, around 40% of the respondents who knew of the existence of reports said that accessible reports took the form of a report book while 37.9% of respondents said that they took the form of oral announcements
Oral announcements were the form that most respondents in Konsel (72.3%) were familiar with, while most respondents in Donggala (48.1%) knew about UPKD financial reports from the UPKD's notice-board
Among respondents in the two sample districts in South-east Sulawesi, there were none who had been able to obtain information from the notice-board
During a field visit the SMERU team encountered an UPKD that had a notice-board in a house that also functioned as an office
The report placed on the notice-board, however, was limited to a statement of which groups had borrowed money and the size of the loans
In fact, the community did not know for certain who the members of the groups were as the latter had been arranged only as a formality
Supervision and Evaluation of the UPKD According to the juklak, supervision and evaluation are also carried out at different levels and involve project leaders, consultants, cluster managers, facilitators, the village discussion forum and also community groups
Project leaders undertake monitoring and supervision of progress in project implementation
Consultants make general recommendations about such things as bookkeeping, financial reports and supervision, and also monitor and evaluate all project activities
Facilitators and PPLs monitor and control the activities of community groups and report on them to the district-level TKPP
At the same time, the community groups, in conjunction with related government agencies, monitor and evaluate the use of funds and the implementation of IMS activities at the group level
In accordance with these stipulations, monitoring and supervision are to be undertaken by the central level two or three times a year, by the provincial level three or four times a year, and by the district level whenever the need arises
The operational project leader and cluster manager undertake monitoring and supervision at least every time new funds are released
Monitoring and supervision are also carried out if a problem demanding an urgent solution arises in the field
In reality, however, the UPKD management was not aware of any routine supervision apart from that provided by the facilitator, who usually came to the village once a month to give assistance
The supervisory function of individuals at higher levels was considered to be inadequate or unsatisfactory
The experience of UPKDs in Muna and Konsel was that supervision by anyone apart from the facilitator happened no more than once a year and even that occurred only at the beginning of project implementation
It was conducted in such a way that it was more of an ordinary visit than a supervisory exercise
Supervisory activities on the part of the community likewise did not take place according to plan
The reason was that the supervisory function was not emphasized during project socialization
At the same time, the community had very little feeling of ownership toward the project, an attitude that was exacerbated by the low educational levels within the community
Meanwhile, the village discussion forum, which was intended to form a means for supervision by the community, did not continue to function as intended in the stipulations
After the project came to an end and was transferred to the community, there was no clear division of authority between those responsible for decision-making, implementation, and supervision
It was not clear who had to take the initiative in conducting a village discussion if the UPKD had problems, for the role of the village head had been kept to the very minimum from the beginning of the project
It was not at all clear who had to carry out the supervisory function and prepare reports nor was it clear to whom reports should be submitted
Meanwhile, the concept expressed in the juklak of having young village people replace the facilitators was never put into practice
As long as these functions were not institutionalized in an appropriate way, it was difficult for the UPKD to develop and become sustainable
It would seem that the UPKD has lost direction, yet at the same time the regional government has very little sense of ownership of this unit
The consequence is that many UPKDs have declined or else have simply collapsed
On the whole, the UPKDs in sample villages in Central Sulawesi are in better condition than those in South-east Sulawesi
A special body, known as the BP-UPKD or UPKD Supervisory Body, was formed at village level in Central Sulawesi
The BP consists of community figures and members of the BPD (Village Representative Board)
Its tasks are to supervise and control UPKD administration and finances, to ensure that administration and bookkeeping are done in an orderly manner, to report on activities at regular intervals or at least once in three months to a village meeting, and to monitor the work of community groups in handling and returning credit
On the whole, the role of the BP-UPKD appears to be effective with the result that the sample UPKDs in Central Sulawesi are generally still functioning
In one village in Tolitoli, the BP-UPKD is also giving assistance to the UPKD management in preparing financial reports and is expected to be able to supervise community groups through a persuasive approach
UPKD office-holders admit that their ability to prepare financial reports is limited and so the assistance provided by the BP-UPKD has been very useful
UPKD financial reports have been checked every month and results forwarded to the project leader and cluster manager
In one village in Donggala, members of the BP UPKD visited aquaculture ponds whose owners had experienced failures when the ponds were destroyed by high waves
The BP-UPKD then held a village meeting to discuss the disaster and to find a solution to the problem of loan repayments that were in arrears
In Konsel, community supervision is carried out only by an existing institution, namely the BPD
Its role, however, is almost non-existent because structurally it is not mentioned in the program
In one case in a sample village, however, the BPD took the initiative in conducting a village discussion when the UPKD management misused funds
In Muna, all sample UPKDs said that since the end of employment of facilitators, no institution has had a supervisory function with regard to the UPKD
Related parties in all sample villages also said that since the beginning of the project there has been no involvement of community groups in the monitoring of UPKD performance and use of money
In any case, there is no clear mention of the control mechanism that should be adopted by community groups in connection with UPKD finances
Villagers themselves, especially borrowers, said that an institution to supervise the UPKD's performance is greatly needed
They felt that this function could be undertaken by the village head, another village official or some other institution
In the design of SAADP, no mention is made of the involvement of village and subdistrict officials in project implementation, apart from the role of the village head in village discussions and preparation of letters of appointment for UPKD office-holders
Even so, many UPKD office-holders would welcome the inclusion of village and subdistrict governments, especially in the supervision of credit repayments by the community
This is related to the question of the authority and power of the local government within the community, for these are qualities that the UPKD management does not have
In Muna a district-level meeting decided that village and subdistrict governments would be involved in assistance to and supervision of SAADP implementation from September 2003
Nevertheless, up to the time when the SMERU study was carried out, the UPKDs had not experienced this involvement, except in one sample village where the village head happens to be the son of the UPKD chairman
There are both advantages and disadvantages from the involvement of village officials in supervision of the UPKD
The non-involvement of the village head and other village officials has enabled the UPKD in a number of sample villages to act arbitrarily in extending loans and has encouraged the community to be more willing to leave the repayment of loans in arrears
In one sample village, however, where the village head was involved, he became so dominant that he weakened the role of the UPKD officeholders
This person has borrowed up to Rp10 million and has asked a number of participants for money
So far there has been no monitoring by independent institutions like NGOs, apart from the NGO that supplied facilitators
In Konsel an NGO submitted a proposal to the district government to carry out monitoring, but because the government had no funds available for this purpose, the monitoring did not take place
Misuse of Funds by UPKD Management The consequence of the relatively non-transparent system of UPKD management, the very limited amount of assistance given to the UPKD, and the weak supervision of UPKD performance has on some occasions led to misuse of money repaid by participants
Cases of misuse of SAADP funds by the UPKD chairman in the early days of project implementation were reported in several sample villages in Konsel, Tolitoli, and Donggala
Apart from issues concerning the UPKD, funds were also misused by the heads of groups, as happened in a case in Muna, where a number of group heads did not pass on to the UPKD the whole of the money paid to them by members of their groups
Such cases were settled, however, with the help of the village security apparatus
Other forms of misuse of money included the granting of a loan to a person not entitled to participate in SAADP, such as a facilitator
5.5 UPKD Financial Management Capacity Training for UPKD Office-holders
At the beginning of the project certain UPKD office-holders, namely the chairman and the treasurer, received training at least twice
The training, which was held at district level, was conducted by consultants or public servants from Bappeda
The training material covered the way in which loan proposals should be prepared, the criteria used in selection of proposals and the way to handle finances, revolving funds and bookkeeping
The UPKD office-holders also received guidance from facilitators who visited the village regularly
In reality, not all UPKD office-holders, especially those from UPKDs that were late in formation, received training
This happened in the case of the UPKD in one sample village in Konsel
A training program for UPKD office-holders in the subdistrict where the village is located was cancelled by Leppsek
The reason given was that the training was to be held without the knowledge of Leppsek, which was the NGO that provided SAADP facilitators for the province of South-east Sulawesi
Several UPKD office-holders felt that the frequency of training was insufficient, which affected their ability to handle finances and bookkeeping
UPKD office-holders in one sample village in Tolitoli stated that the training they received did not touch on their real needs
There were often changes, for example, in the bookkeeping format, which made it difficult for them to apply the format in their daily work
In dealing with problems of this kind, the UPKD management normally utilized the services of the facilitator for consultations or else they asked members of the village community who were relatively well educated or who understood bookkeeping
Risk Management
Sanctions and Security
As discussed above, the juklak says nothing about security on loans
The introduction of guarantees as a requirement for loans occurred when difficulties arose in the repayment of credit and when the number of participants with outstanding debts rose
The notion of collateral, however, could not be implemented effectively and was really intended to frighten borrowers from defaulting
In an attempt to encourage participants to return their loans as quickly as possible, the UPKDs adopted a number of different approaches
In one sample village in Tolitoli, for example, UPKD office-holders collected repayment installments accompanied by the village security apparatus so that participants in arrears would feel scared and immediately repay the credit
As it turned out, however, many members of the community regarded this method of collecting debts as a form of intimidation and some even described the UPKD as a money-lender who used threats in recovering money
This same UPKD also tried announcing the names of participants who had outstanding debts and the amount of money that they owed on a notice-board and through a pamphlet
This strategy, which was intended as a form of report and as a means of making the persons concerned feel so embarrassed that they would repay their loans promptly, did not go over very well with community members and led to protests that it was an insult to them
One UPKD in Donggala also tried announcing the names of those with large outstanding debts in written form in the village meeting hall
This action, however, did not make the persons concerned feel embarrassed and repay their debts
Rather, it had a bad effect on other members of the community
Participants who had previously repaid credit installments regularly soon fell into arrears because they saw that no sanctions had been imposed on the big debtors
Another method used by the UPKD in dealing with those in arrears with repayments was to send them a warning letter and then restructure the times for payment of their installments
Nevertheless, this approach, like others, did not achieve its objective since the UPKD was unable to impose any formal sanctions that would be binding upon participants because it was not yet a legal body
Ultimately, many UPKDs handed problems of this kind over to the village head and his staff
Village officials generally chose to settle the matters of arrears in a family spirit, which meant giving the borrower a better understanding of the credit mechanism and at the same time asking him/her to repay the loan
5.6 UPKD Relationships with the Formal Banking System
The UPKDs have no specific relationship with the formal banking sector
Any contact between the two was limited to the beginning of the project, when the UPKD opened an account with the nearest branch of the BRI for receiving and keeping funds, as stipulated in the juklak
The UPKD account did not receive special attention but was treated like that of any other bank customer
Information from the BRI branches that were visited indicated that they did not know of the existence of the SAADP project nor were they aware of the existence of the UPKD as an account-holder
Although the BRI was designated as the bank through which SAADP project funds would be released and kept, in actual implementation the UPKD could deposit funds in some other bank that was closer or more convenient
A number of UPKDs were found of having used the bank only for the release of funds
After funds reached the UPKD account, all the money was withdrawn for distribution as loans to project participants
Money repaid by participants was never deposited in the bank but was immediately lent out to other borrowers
In one case in Donggala an UPKD has begun considering cooperation with a government bank (Bank Mandiri) to obtain financial support
The proposal has already been discussed and has received a positive response from the bank as well as support from the district government
5.7 The UPKD and Development of Local Financial Markets
At the present time the UPKD is still the only formal financial institution in sample villages
Research observations indicate that the UPKD system has had no apparent influence on the development of local financial markets
No other financial institutions have emerged at village level since the UPKD was established
The nearest existing financial institution is the cooperative, which is located in the main town of the subdistrict
Cooperative managers normally come to the villages to lend out money or to collect debts
The amount of money that can be borrowed ranges from Rp100,000 to Rp200,000
In this matter of loans, however, the cooperative resembles a moneylender since daily repayment is required and interest is 20% per month
Not many village people borrow from these cooperatives, only those who had daily income
An alternative source of credit is the bank
People generally borrow from a bank if they want to improve their house or buy a motor vehicle
The size of such loans varies, as does the repayment period
The banks impose interest rates that are higher than those set by the UPKDs
The UPKD itself exists only for the second-stage lending out of project money, the amount of which is tending to decrease because credit repayments are in arrears
Meanwhile, there is absolutely no sign of the UPKD accumulating or receiving deposits of community funds
Nevertheless, the presence of the UPKD, especially in villages where it has been functioning rather well, has led to a relative expansion in the economic activities of borrowers in other businesses
In one village in Muna, for example, the existence of the UPKD has led to the creation of a business that provides TV and VCD viewing services
This in turn has encouraged the growth of trade activities in the immediate vicinity
Qualitatively, it can be said that the presence of effective UPKDs has increased the circulation of money at the village level
5.8 The Present Status and Condition of the SAADP Project
Five years since the change in design or since the UPKD was established as a village credit institution
If seen from the present state of the UPKDs, the condition of the SAADP project in the sample villages can be said to vary greatly
There are UPKDs that are functioning relatively smoothly, there are those that are still functioning but with such large outstanding debts that the amount of money for revolving funds is extremely limited, and there are those that are not functioning at all
The main problem in the majority of SAADP villages is the fact that loans have not been fully repaid or else have not been repaid at all
In Muna District, only one of the three UPKDs that were visited was functioning relatively well
Although this UPKD also had the problem of outstanding debts, they were not too large
The second UPKD was close to stagnation because a number of participants had made no repayments at all
In this village, the only type of credit that was still being repaid was loans given for trading activities
Meanwhile, repayment in the third village had stopped completely
At the end of 2002, the UPKD was able to recirculate around 30% of the Rp52.9 million that had initially been distributed to the community as loans
Up to now only Rp2.2 million of this money has been repaid
Respondents said that in fact they are willing to repay their outstanding debts if those who borrowed very large sums of money also repay their loans, and if there is transparency on the part of the UPKD management concerning the financial situation and the use of funds
According to the UPKD management, the fact that no sanctions were imposed in neighboring villages where the UPKDs had already ceased to function, encouraged SAADP participants in this village to default on their loans
In Konsel District, the three UPKDs that were visited had not operated since the end of 2003 because participants had not repaid their loans
According to qualitative information, only three out of the 20 UPKDs in the sample subdistrict are still running
One of the reasons why participants have not repaid their loans is that no sanctions have been imposed on the UPKD office-holders themselves for the misuse of funds
Other information indicates that there is a wrong perception of the project on the part of the community as a consequence of a statement by a facilitator during socialization that SAADP assistance was a grant
Meanwhile, in Donggala and Tolitoli the repayment of loans has gone relatively well, the reason being that UPKD managers in both districts have taken actual operational measures to raise the repayment rate
They have, for example, formed teams to collect debts and have rescheduled the times for debt repayment
UPKD office-holders have themselves set a good example by repaying their own loans at the correct time
They have also introduced changes in some of the sample villages in certain aspects of the credit scheme such as the interest rate, the length of time for repayment and the size of the loan that a person can obtain
A further change has involved doing away with the requirement to form groups
This has made it easier for members of the community to gain access to loans
UPKD office-holders expressed the hope that the UPKD could be made into a legal entity as this would give it legal power to take firmer action against those who default on loans
At the present time there are no regulations that refer to micro-financial institutions like the UPKD
Some district governments have attempted to strengthen the existence of the UPKD through a Letter of Decree signed by the district head
The provincial government of South-east Sulawesi is currently seeking some kind of legal arrangement that is suitable for the UPKD
It is hoped that as a legal body, will be able to manage all government projects and programs in the form of revolving funds at village level
One other development is the formation of an UPKD Communication Forum in Banawa Subdistrict in Donggala District, which, it is hoped, will function as a place for discussions
In order to ensure the sustainability of the UPKD after the end of the project, several districts have planned to allocate funds from their own budgets to pay facilitators who will be placed in each subdistrict
The provincial government of South-east Sulawesi has already provided funds to be used in guidance and supervision of the UPKDs in each district
At the same time the district government in Donggala has allocated a sum of money that will be deposited in the bank accounts of the UPKDs as fresh funds
VI THE INVOLVEMENT OF WOMEN AND NGOs IN SAADP
6.1 The Involvement of Women
Basically there was no difference in the way in which women and men were treated in the SAADP project
Both have been directly involved as credit recipients, facilitators, and UPKD office-holders, although not in equal proportions
Overall, the number of women borrowers is relatively small by comparison with the number of men who obtained SAADP loans
Women borrowers account for only 117 or 26.8% of the 436 persons who received SAADP credit
The greatest proportion of women borrowers occurred in Donggala District (42.6%) and the smallest in Konsel District (14.4%), as Table 6.1.1 indicates
A comparison of the two provinces shows that the proportion of women borrowers in Central Sulawesi (33.6%) was somewhat greater than the proportion in South-east Sulawesi (20.1%)
The proportion of SAADP loans obtained by women shows a figure that is relatively the same as the proportion of borrowers
Only 28.7% of a total of 557 loans were given to women, with the highest percentage in Donggala (57.6%) and the lowest in Konsel (13.6%)
The high proportion of women borrowers and of SAADP loans to women in Donggala is a reflection of the extent to which women in this area are involved in trade or in the weaving of traditional cloth
This is one indication that women who own and are responsible for the running of a business have had the same opportunities as men to obtain SAADP credit
The reason for the limited participation of women in SAADP is not that there was any discrimination or difference in treatment at the time when credit proposals were submitted, but rather that a relatively small number of women put forward proposals for loans
This can be traced very largely to the fact that one of the regulations in the SAADP credit system was that each household could receive only one loan within one financial year
When the revolving stage had been reached, other household members were allowed to submit requests for loans, provided that they met the requirements
In this matter the household itself did not make a sharp distinction between whether the loan was in the husband's name or in that of the wife because both husband and wife regarded it as a loan to the household, which was generally represented by the husband as the head of the family
Furthermore, the majority of requests for SAADP credit and the main purposes for which the credit was used involved farming and fisheries
This type of work is usually handled by men with women normally assisting their husbands, although in practice both have almost equal responsibility
The absence of any kind of discrimination against women in the acceptance of credit proposals is further proven by the negative answers of a majority (84.6%) of respondents from SAADP households to this question
Only around 1.5% of respondents stated that there was a difference in the treatment of women, as Table 6.1.2 reveals
According to the 1.5% of household respondents who said that there was a difference in the treatment of women, those differences lay in the amount of credit, conditions for collateral, and the rejection of proposals submitted by women in fishing activities
One further form of discrimination that was mentioned by these respondents, namely that women's proposals were given priority in acceptance since women were considered to be more disciplined in repaying loans, was actually to the advantage of women
Table 6.1.3 shows that 62.5% of SAADP loans given to women involved capital for trading activities, while 15.1% involved capital for agriculture and 11.9% capital for home industry
If an examination is made by districts, trade and farming are the activities most frequently proposed by women in all areas in requests for SAADP loans
In Donggala and Konsel, however, the proportion of credit proposals from women for industrial undertakings was rather large
In the case of Konsel, the types of industrial activity undertaken by the majority of women were cake-making and stone-crushing, while in Donggala cottage weaving was the main industrial activity
According to qualitative information from UPKDs, there was relatively no difference between women and men participants in the repayment of loans
Repayment by women who owned kiosks tended to be somewhat better than average because their economic undertakings were more stable and, unlike activities in farming, smallholder agriculture and fisheries, were not subject to changes in natural conditions
On the whole, SAADP loans to women were used for the purposes stated in the proposals, where most were used as capital for trade by kiosk owners and itinerant vendors
With the availability of SAADP credit, the trading activities of many women progressed rapidly
At the same time, there was an increase in the number of women who entered the field of trade
For example, the provision of SAADP credit in one village in Donggala led to a rise in the number of women trading in fish
Apart from that, the position of women traders was strengthened because they now had ready cash and could therefore be more selective in the fish that they bought and the fishermen from whom they bought it
Previously they could purchase fish only from fishermen who were willing to wait for payment until after the fish had been completely sold (usually one to two days)
Three indicators have been used to measure positive change in the role of women after introduction of the SAADP project, namely
productive economic activities, decision making within the household, and the involvement of women in community-level activities (Table 6.1.4)
The overall proportion of households that believed that the role of women, as revealed by these three indicators, had increased was greater in SAADP than in control households
Thus the difference between the proportions of SAADP and control households was positive in value, which shows that SAADP had some positive effect in improving the role of women, at least as far as these three indicators were concerned
The impact of SAADP on the role of women in productive economic activities was 11.9%, which is statistically significant at the 5% level
The effect on the role of women in household decision-making was 4.8% and in activities at village, hamlet (RW) and neighborhood (RT) levels was 5.7%, but these last two figures are not statistically significant
If the impact is considered by district, a significant effect was found only in the third indicator (involvement in village-level activities) in Tolitoli District
The relatively insignificant change for women is perhaps explained by the fact that the majority of SAADP participants were men
In all sample districts except Konsel, women were involved in UPKD management
Usually women held the position of treasurer
In Muna, there were women UPKD treasurers in two of the sample villages
In the first of the two villages, however, the woman concerned was active only at the beginning of project implementation, after which her task was taken over by the head of the UPKD
In the second village, the woman concerned was not appointed officially through a village meeting or with the agreement of the community
She was asked by her father, who happened to be the head of the UPKD, to take on the job of treasurer as a replacement for the elected treasurer who had moved to another district
In one village in Donggala, a woman held the two positions of head of the UPKD and treasurer
While in another village there was a woman treasurer who proved to be extremely active in collecting outstanding SAADP credit
In Tolitoli, there were two villages in which the UPKD treasurers were women
One was so committed to her work that she was more active than the head of the UPKD
On the question of women's involvement in UPKD management, there was in fact a recommendation from the provincial and district governments in South-east Sulawesi that the position of UPKD treasurer should be held by a woman because women are considered to be more industrious and more painstaking in recording financial matters
This suggestion, however, was ignored in most villages
Women facilitators were found in almost all areas, with the exception of the sample villages in Muna District
Even so, there were seven women out of a total of 35 facilitators in Muna
Even though the number of women facilitators was limited, their performance was considered to be good
In some cases, as in a certain village in Donggala, the woman facilitator was extremely active
According to the local UPKD management, this woman did not hesitate to spend time explaining the program to the community, even though she had to do this in the evening
Towards the end of her period of duty she was still trying to establish a cooperation between the UPKD and a government bank
She was involved directly in the preparation of a proposal and helped arrange meetings between relevant persons at district level and the branch manager of the bank in question
6.2 The Involvement of Non-Government Organizations
In order to maximize implementation in the field, the SAADP project included facilitators to assist the community
They were recruited from local non-government organizations (NGOs)
The facilitators for Central Sulawesi came from the Rosontapura NGO and those for South-east Sulawesi from the NGO known as Leppsek
The NGO placed a coordinator of facilitators at the district level and facilitators at village level
In general, one facilitator had duties in three to four villages
In South-east Sulawesi, changes or rotations in the locations where facilitators were placed were introduced so that they would not become bored and would gain additional knowledge
Because of this policy, the sample villages that received SAADP credit between the 1999/2000 financial year and 2003 had usually had two or three different facilitators
The replacement of facilitators also occurred in Central Sulawesi but for a different reason
In this province the tender for selection of an NGO to provide facilitators was repeated every year
The chosen NGO changed every year except during the last two years, when the tender was won by Rosontapura consecutively
According to the juklak issued by Bangda, the tasks and functions of the facilitators were in essence to help in implementation of project activities, in the provision of field-level guidance from the preparatory and planning stages to the stages of supervision of implementation and monitoring, and in administrative work
In undertaking these tasks, the facilitator was to have frequent contact with the community and in particular with community groups that had become SAADP participants
Information from respondents, however, revealed that many people were unaware of the existence of facilitators
Out of a total of 408 households that participated in SAADP in the four sample districts, only 66.9% knew of the existence of a facilitator (Table 6.2.1)
The fact that quite a large number of households did not know points to the absence of a close relationship between the facilitator and the community
On the whole, the community knew the facilitator as the person who gave an explanation of the program during project socialization and who visited the UPKD several times
Very few SAADP participants knew that the employment of facilitators ended in June 2003
This can be seen from the answers of the 37.7% of respondent households who were aware of the existence of facilitators said that there are still facilitators 
While 4.8% said that they did not know (Table 6.2.2)
In general facilitators played a role only at the beginning of project implementation or during the preparatory and planning stages
They were involved during the program socialization process and facilitated formation of the UPKD and they also assisted the UPKD in selecting community proposals for initial loans
This fits in with the knowledge respondents had of the activities carried out by facilitators in the context of the SAADP project (Table 6.2.3)
Some 82.4% of the 273 households that knew of the existence of facilitators believed that their main activity was SAADP socialization, while 56.5% also said that facilitators provided assistance to the UPKD management
After the SAADP project was functioning, that is after funds had been released and distributed by the UPKD to the community, the role of the facilitator in assisting the community grew steadily smaller
His/her role became more focused on the UPKD and on preparation of the regular reports on UPKD activities that had to be submitted to the cluster manager and project leaders at district level
Facilitators usually visited the UPKD only once or twice a month
Relatively good facilitators were found in several instances in the sample villages
In one sample village in Donggala, for example, a facilitator was still actively assisting the UPKD even though the project had concluded
This facilitator carried out all tasks with enthusiasm, giving guidance in financial management to UPKD office-holders and visiting local households together with UPKD staff to explain the program
Another facilitator has been actively involved in the house-to-house collection of loan instalments
The relatively better role played by facilitators in Donggala is reflected in the high proportion (67.7%) of respondents from SAADP households who said that the facilitator had also helped with assistance to and the training of participants
It can be noted that the frequency of each activity undertaken by facilitators is not known since these activities generally occurred only at the beginning of the project and did not extend to all participants
The activities and involvement of facilitators in Donggala District would appear to be relatively better than in the other three sample districts
Of 68 SAADP respondents in Donggala who knew of the existence of facilitators, around 85.3% stated that the facilitator had played a role or had played an adequate role
This proportion is far higher than proportions in the other districts
Overall, some 38.5% of respondents who knew of the existence of a facilitator said either that the facilitator had played an inadequate role or had had no role or else that they did not know about his/her role (Table 6.2.4)
In this context some 45.5% of respondents stated that the main benefit they felt from the involvement of facilitators was a better understanding of the project (Table 6.2.5)
This is in accordance with the statement of a large majority of respondents that socialization was the main activity carried out by facilitators during the project
At the same time, some 29% of respondents said that the main benefit from the involvement of facilitators was that they obtained assistance while a similar proportion said that it meant that they had persons whom they could consult
This proportion is about the same as the proportion of respondents who felt no benefit at all from the involvement of facilitators (27.5%)
During the study, information was obtained about a case where a facilitator made a serious error at the beginning of the SAADP project
In one subdistrict in Konsel, the facilitator informed the community that SAADP funds were a grant and therefore did not have to be returned
Although the facilitator concerned was replaced and socialization was repeated, there are still community members who believe that SAADP loans do not have to be repaid
This error in perception is thought to be the main reason why credit has not been repaid in all sample villages, but a further factor is the misuse of funds by a manager
Apart from these cases, the facilitators in two sample villages in Muna passed on the information that part of the interest on loans woud be deducted in advance at the time when the money was distributed to the community
The mistake was only realized when funds reached the revolving stage or when the facilitator was replaced
Another case involved a facilitator who borrowed Rp7 million from SAADP funds in one of the sample villages
The UPKD found it impossible to refuse his request because it was believed that this facilitator had done the village a service by enabling it to obtain SAADP assistance
Although part of the money has been returned, the consequence is that the case has been used by other borrowers as a reason for not repaying their own loans when they fall due
These various cases point to a weakness in the facilitation system that was adopted
Nevertheless, UPKDs felt on the whole that the involvement of facilitators was of real benefit to project implementation and that they are still needed
The facilitator could constitute a place for consultations about the management of SAADP funds, a source of moral support for the UPKD in facing community demands and proof to the community that there was constant supervision of SAADP implementation to ensure that loans were repaid
UPKD office-holders in a number of villages in all sample districts admitted that, in the time since the employment of facilitators ceased, the UPKD has been unable to refuse credit requests from cluster managers and officials such as those in subdistrict and village administrative offices
Apart from UPKD office-holders, a majority of SAADP households (52.0%) also indicated that they still need facilitators, while 18.3% agreed but added that improvements are necessary (Table 6.2.6)
This appears to be contradictory to the statements of the same participants about the limited role played by facilitators and their poor performance in the past
The opinion can, however, be understood because in actual fact these participants did not know exactly what the real task of facilitators was, yet at the same time they felt that they still needed guidance
VII LOCAL PLANNING, INSTITUTIONS AND TRANSPARENCY
7.1 Community Participation in Village Planning and Activities
The influence of SAADP on the involvement of participants in village planning and in the implementation of community activities has been examined through three indicators
involvement in planning and community activities at the local level (village, hamlet, or neighborhood), involvement in traditional ceremonies, and involvement in organizational activities
From changes in the extent of respondents' involvement after the introduction of the SAADP project, it is possible to judge whether there has been increased participation, the same level of participation, or less participation
After a comparison is made of changes in these indicators between SAADP and control households, the difference between the two is regarded as the influence
Most respondents among SAADP households (72.6%) and control households (71.9%) stated that their involvement in planning or the implementation of community activities at the local level had not changed
Data in Table 7.1.1 show that only 25.3% of SAADP household respondents said that their involvement had increased.
These answers do not differ very much from those of control respondents, where 19.1% of them stated that there had been an increase in their involvement
This means that the net impact of SAADP on the increased involvement in local planning and activities was 6.2%, and it is statistically not significant
An effect that is statistically significant at 5 percent level occurred in Tolitoli and the Province of Central Sulawesi (respectively 17.6% and 10.7%)
Meanwhile, some 47.8% of SAADP household respondents and 36.2% of control household respondents reported increased involvement in traditional ceremonies
This means that the effect of SAADP in encouraging participation in traditional ceremonies was 11.6%, which is statistically significant at 1 percent level
The same happened in Tolitoli and Konsel Districts and in the Province of South-east Sulawesi as a whole, where the effect was significant at 5 percent level (see Table 7.1.2)
The pattern of SAADP and control households on the change of respondents participation in local organizational activities is similar, most of them (75,7% and 72,9% respectively) stated that their involvement had not changed
The proportion of responden who said that their involvement was increased only 19,9% among SAADP households and 16,7% among control households
The overall impact of SAADP on the increased involvement of respondents in local organizational activities is positif (3,2%) but statistically not significant (See Table 7.1.3)
This finding indicate that the presence of SAADP project did not tend to increase the level of respondent's involvement in local organizational activities
Although the performance of groups, facilitators and PPLs was considered to be unsatisfactory, there were certain participants who could more actively and more effectively absorb information from the training that was provided than could other participants
The level of their activity had an influence on their involvement in local community affairs
Qualitative information reveals that increased participation in village planning and the implementation of village activities was indeed apparent among those persons who experienced growth in their economic capacity after they had participated in the SAADP project
This economic growth enabled their social status to improve, encouraged them to take part in village planning and other community activities, and to interact more frequently with facilitators
As a result, their outlook broadened and they were more able to contribute both money and ideas to the community
Their increased social status also led to them being more respected by other members of the community
In this way success in efforts to raise the individual's status within his social environment was able to help increase his role in the wider life of the community
7.2 Institutional Strengthening at the Local Level
It had been hoped that the presence of the UPKD system, which was introduced and established through the IMS-SAADP project, would exert a positive influence through the strengthening of wider local institutions outside the UPKD itself
The UPKD system provided a forum for community discussion about such matters as SAADP implementation, the formation of community groups, activities by facilitators, and transparency in UPKD management
The opportunity to discuss these matters should have led not only to improvements in patterns of thought and behavior and increased community knowledge about micro-finance but also to a spin-off in the form of a strengthening of other institutions at the village level
Experience has shown, however, that the hope was far from actual achievement
The fact that the project design was not always implemented in an optimum manner, as has been explained in earlier chapters of this report, reduced the possibilities for a positive impact in the shape of a strengthening of existing local institutions
Qualitative information in the field highlighted the following points
The village discussion forum, which was the community gathering at which decisions could be made about various village problems, generally did not develop by comparison with pre-project days, except at the very beginning of project implementation
The group system, which was intended to strengthen group cooperation in economic undertakings, also did not function well, the reason being that groups were established only as a formality to meet project requirements, particularly at the time when credit proposals were submitted
Ultimately, the community groups that had been expected to stimulate institutional activities within the community did not eventuate
Activities at the hamlet and neighborhood levels on the whole experienced very little change, in the sense that those persons who had always been active remained active while those who had never been active stayed that way
The SAADP system did virtually nothing to strengthen other institutions that existed in the village such as rotating credit groups and savings-and-loan activities
The description presented in Chapter V about the UPKD system also shows that throughout the project there was no special relationship between the UPKD and formal and informal financial institutions either within or outside the village
Furthermore, there has been no sign of any strengthening or increase in local financial institutions
Even so, there are certain features of the UPKD system that have the potential to strengthen local institutions
On the whole, the regional governments themselves feel that the UPKD approach is better than the sectoral approach
This belief has encouraged the provincial government of South-east Sulawesi to commence discussions concerning the formation of a South-east Sulawesi Bank that uses the UPKD as one of its models
In expanding other developmental programs, the same provincial government has begun to introduce the 'integrated harmonious' system, to ensure that programs coming into the province do not overlap with each other
New programs should not detract in any way from existing programs but rather must prove complementary
For example, in Kolaka District (which was not one of the SMERU sample areas), management of the revolving funds associated with the Subdistrict Development Program has been entrusted to the UPKD in a number of villages
7.3 Transparency in Local Governance
Field-level research found no indications that implementation of the SAADP project had encouraged greater transparency at the local government level
The reason lies in the fact that within the UPKD management itself the principle of transparency was not fully observed
The majority of UPKD office-holders were judged by respondents to be insufficiently open, and only 34.4% of households stated that accessible UPKD reports and information were available or had once existed (see section 5.4
The Reporting and Supervisory System)
Transparency in UPKD management generally existed only at the initial stage of distribution of funds for loans
At that stage a number of parties still played a part in project implementation, a fact that encouraged transparency
The facilitator and the PPL, for example, were members of the verification team, while the village head, who according to regulations was not supposed to be involved, was in actual practice also a member of the verification team in a number of villages
Furthermore, community discussions were still held at that stage and provided an opportunity for the presentation of information to the community about project development
With progress in the project, implementation became more concentrated among UPKD office-holders to the point where in some villages the UPKD was run by the chairman alone
Decisions about the granting of loans were made exclusively by the UPKD, while the community gatherings that should have been held every three months no longer took place or else were held very infrequently
VIII THE SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACT
The socioeconomic impact of the SAADP project can be seen through changes in a number of output and outcome indicators that are related to the socioeconomic situation of the community
changes in business management (which covers perspectives and practices), changes in family income, changes in savings behavior, changes in housing conditions, and changes in ownership of assets
As described in research methodology in Chapter 1, impact is measured by comparing the situation before and after project implementation between households that received SAADP loans and control households
8.1 The Benefits of SAADP Credit
The majority (90.4%) of respondents believe that the SAADP project has been of benefit to them as a source of micro credit
The benefit felt by respondents has been the availability of capital, which has been used to add to existing business capital, to establish new economic activities, or to pay for other needs
The proportion of respondents who said that SAADP has been of benefit is greater in South-east Sulawesi (96.6%) than in Central Sulawesi (only 84.3% of respondents) (see Table 8.1.1)
Most respondents (93.4%) also said that the credit they received was used in accordance with the purpose stated in their credit proposal
If, however, the proportion who said that SAADP was beneficial is compared with the proportion who used the loan in accordance with their proposal, it will be seen that the two do not always run parallel
The reason is that credit is felt to be more beneficial if it is used in keeping with the respondent's needs at a certain point in time or if the economic activity thus financed is able to expand
According to the regulations, SAADP credit was intended for productive economic activities
Data reveal that the majority of SAADP participants in all sample districts proposed (98.3%) and used (99.7%) loans as business capital, whether for agriculture (cultivation of food crops and tree crops), trading activities, fishing, and household industry, or for other economic undertakings
Even so, a small number of participants made a proposal (6.6%) and used (16.7%) the SAADP credit for educational and health expenses, house improvements, daily consumption purposes, and the outlay of money required for a household member to become an Indonesian Overseas Worker (TKI)
These figures indicate that a slight shift occurred in the use of credit, that is loans requested for productive economic activities were in actual practice used for other purposes that tended to be consumptive
This happened particularly in the two districts in South-east Sulawesi (see Appendix Table 8.1)
The fact that proposals were accepted for credit that would be used outside productive economic activities indicates that the UPKD did not exert strict control in deciding which activities would be financed by SAADP credit
Respondents engaged in the agricultural sector generally used SAADP credit to expand an existing activity, such as land management, the purchase of production inputs (seed, fertilizer, and pesticides), expansion in farm land, and additions to or replacement of the types of crop under cultivation
Fishermen normally used the credit to buy fishing equipment, such as ordinary nets and dragnets and outboard motors
In other sectors like home industry and trade, the loans were used to increase the volume of business or to purchase additional industrial inputs and trading goods
This information is supported by qualitative explanations from various resource persons in all four sample districts
A problem frequently mentioned by both respondents and resource persons is the absence of any guarantee that the provision of credit will continue
Many people are worried that this will hinder further expansion in their economic activities
On the whole, the first loans were sufficient only as investment capital to start an economic activity but a continuous injection of working capital is needed to keep the business going
8.2 Business Perspectives and Practices
Table 8.2.1 shows that in all locations there were households that felt an improvement in their business perspectives after the SAADP project was introduced
The proportion ranged from 27.3% to 62.8% of all sample households
On average, the proportion of SAADP households that experienced a change of this kind was 53.2%
During the same period some 38.1% of control households had the same experience of an increase in their business perspectives
Thus the net effect of the SAADP project on increased business perspectives is 15.1%, which is statistically significant at 1 percent level
In most sample districts, SAADP had a positive impact on the increase in business perspectives, with values that are statistically significant at 1 percent level (in Donggala and Tolitoli) and at 5 percent level (in Konsel)
The only exception was Muna District, where the increase in business perspectives was felt more by control households, even though the difference is not statistically significant
Qualitative information suggests that this can be traced to insufficient or even lack of transfer of business knowledge from the SAADP project and that additional knowledge obtained from other sources by SAADP households was similar to that obtained by control households
According to respondents and resource persons, additional knowledge was usually obtained from friends and neighbors or from personal experience
The PPLs, whose institutional task was to provide agricultural extension services, played the role designated for them in the juklak, that is as members of the verification team, and for that reason they were active only at the beginning of the project
In fact, many respondents were not aware of the existence of the PPLs
Meanwhile, the facilitators, as described in Chapter V, played a greater role in assisting the UPKD than in helping the community
The number of respondents who obtained additional knowledge from PPLs or related government agencies was extremely small
In many cases additional knowledge from these official channels was a source of information that was passed on orally from one person to another
The various types of business perspective that respondents said had increased were placed in four groups, namely marketing, diversification in activities, administration/finances, and production techniques, as shown in Table 8.2.2
In both SAADP and control households the type of knowledge that increased most of all concerned diversification in activities, followed by knowledge about production techniques, marketing, and administration/finances
Overall, the proportion of SAADP households that experienced an increase in business perspectives was greater than the proportion of control households
This occurred in the case of all types of perspectives
From the point of view of differences in the proportion of SAADP and control households, the types of business knowledge most affected by SAADP were production techniques (11.4%), marketing (8.4%), and administration/finances (7.4%)
The effect on these three types of knowledge was statistically significant at 1 percent level
While the impact on diversification in economic activities (6.4%) was not statistically significant
The impact of SAADP showed a very similar trend among households in Tolitoli
In Donggala the impact of SAADP was significant on increased knowledge about administration/finances while in Konsel it was significant on increased knowledge about production techniques
Meanwhile, the effect in Muna was not significant on increases in any kind of business perspectives
If the impact of SAADP on changes in business practices is considered, there is overall a positive value, namely 5.4%, but the figure is not statistically significant
In the sample area, the figures of 20.9% for Konsel District and 12.7% for the Province of South-east Sulawesi are significant at 5% percent level
In Donggala District and Central Sulawesi values tend to be negative and statistically insignificant (see Table 8.2.3)
A number of respondents said that the availability of SAADP loans encouraged them to change their business practices
In many instances, however, the changes that they made were based not on new knowledge but rather on knowledge that they had already mastered but had been unable to put into practice because of a shortage of capital
This explains why the proportion of households that made changes in their business practices was greater than the proportion that experienced increases in business perspectives
Parallel with the types of business perspectives, the types of business practices that underwent the greatest changes in both SAADP and control households were diversification in activities and production techniques
Overall, the influence of SAADP on changes in each type of business practice was relatively small, as can be seen from Table 8.2.4
A positive effect occurred with marketing practices (1.8%), administrative/financial practices (0.8%), and production techniques (8.5%)
While in the case of diversification in activities the effect was negative, namely, -3.5%
However, statistical tests indicate that the impact of SAADP was significant at 1 percent level only in the case of practices connected with production techniques
In Donggala and Tolitoli, the effect of SAADP on diversification in economic activities has a negative value because the proportion of control households that increased their types of economic activity was greater than the proportion of SAADP households
The negative value at the provincial level in Central Sulawesi was 12.5%, which is statistically significant at 5 percent level
In Muna, SAADP had a positive impact on marketing practices (3.9%) that was statistically significant at 5 percent level
In Konsel and at the provincial level in South-east Sulawesi, the SAADP impact was positive and significant at 1 percent level in the case of production technique practices, the values being 23.1% and 10.4% respectively
In Tolitoli the large number of control households that increased their types of economic activity can be traced to the decline in cloves and cocoa production due to the age of the trees
Members of these households tried to find additional work as drivers of ojek or as drivers of public transport vehicles
Meanwhile, in Donggala the increase in new types of undertakings was, among other things, stimulated by the establishment of a new soccer field, which encouraged a number of respondents to start selling snack foods and beverages
Besides this, increased demand for house-roofing made from sago palms, which were readily available in the control village in this district, also encouraged a number of control households to begin making this product
The types of new economic activities undertaken by respondents show wide variations and include trade, small and handicraft industries, services, agriculture, and animal husbandry
On the whole, diversification in agricultural activities has involved the cultivation by farmers of additional types of crops that they had previously not grown
The types of production techniques that experienced increases include the use of certain kinds of nets and of boats with outboard motors by fishermen who previously had used only fishing roads and ordinary boats, the use of chainsaws to fell timber that had previously been cut with manual saws, the use of tractors in agriculture and the increase in other agricultural production techniques such as the drying of agricultural commodities, the use of fertilizer, and the planting of new seeds
Qualitative information also shows that the existence of SAADP led to the appearance of new undertakings in all sample locations
These undertakings varied in type and number, depending on the creativity of the community and on the extent to which SAADP implementation went smoothly
In the SAADP sample villages, there was a rise in the number of kiosks and traders, the availability of rental services for agricultural equipment like tractors and sprayers, and the emergence of services for TV and VCD viewers
Besides the respondents who expanded their number of economic activities or undertook diversification, there were also respondents whose economic activities remained the same or else declined in number
The proportion of households in which the number and types of activities remained the same occupied the highest position in all sample areas, with an average of 59.3% among SAADP households and 52.4% among control households
The proportion of respondents whose undertakings declined in number was relatively small, with 6.4% among SAADP households and 5.7% among control households (see Appendix Table 8.2)
The impact of SAADP on changes in respondents' types of economic activity was negative and significant in Tolitoli District (-20.6%), at the provincial level in Central Sulawesi (-12.0%) and overall (-10,3%) at 1 percent level
Meanwhile, the effects of SAADP on changes in types of activities in Konsel (-11.4%) and at the provincial level in South-east Sulawesi (-8.6%) were significant at 5 percent level
It had been hoped that diversification in economic activities within a household would enable it to survive in the face of risks stemming from external shocks such as crop failure and falls in prices
Households that had alternative sources of income or that were not dependent on just one kind of activity should have greater resistance than those with only one source of income
Nevertheless, Table 8.2.4 (which shows variables in the diversification of activities) and Table 8.2.5 demonstrate that there is no single harmonious relationship between diversification in activities and increases in respondents' capacity to face external shocks
Overall, even though the impact of SAADP on diversification in economic activities shows a negative trend, the impact on increased capacity to handle disruptions has a positive value (7.6%), although not statistically significant
In general, the proportion of respondents who experienced an increase in their capacity to handle such shocks was greater than the proportion of respondents who undertook diversification in their economic activities
This means that diversification of activities is not the only factor that influences the level of the community's capacity to face external shocks
Increases in the production of agricultural commodities and fish, rises in prices, and expansion in economic undertakings are other important factors that exert influence over the capacity to withstand shocks
In Tolitoli and Konsel, the impact of SAADP on increased capacity to face external shocks has positive values of 32.4% and 24.4% respectively
Both figures are significant at 1 percent level
In Muna there is a negative value of 19.8%, which is significant at 5 percent level
At the provincial level in Central Sulawesi the effect of SAADP on respondents' capacity to withstand shocks has a value of 12.9% and is significant at 5% level
Meanwhile, there is no significant effect at the provincial level in South-east Sulawesi
In Muna and Donggala, the differences in increased capacity to deal with external shocks have negative values, which indicates that the increase in control households is higher than in SAADP households
This is due to the fact that control households in these two districts on the whole feel that they have experienced a rather large increase in income, both from the economic activities that they were previously carrying out and from additional activities (diversification)
For example, a number of control households in Muna obtain additional income from remittances sent by family members who are working in Malaysia
Meanwhile, in Donggala households engaged in weaving have been able to increase production because they have children old enough to assist in this work
8.3 Farming Perspectives and Practices
The indicators of farming perspectives and practices that have been analyzed cover the management of land, the use of fertilizer and pesticides, the marketing of products and the post-harvest handling of crops
Only respondents whose livelihood is in the agricultural sector were asked about these five indicators
Overall, SAADP has had a positive impact on increases in all forms of farming perspectives, as Table 8.3.1 shows
The greatest impact was on knowledge concerning land management (13.4%) and the use of fertilizer (12.0%), both figures being significant at 1 percent level
The effect on knowledge of marketing was 7.8%, which is significant at 5 percent level
Meanwhile, the effects on the other types of farming knowledge, namely, the use of pesticides (7.4%) and post-harvest handling of crops (3.8%), are not statistically significant
An impact with an almost identical trend in significance occurred at the provincial level in Central Sulawesi, namely, on increases in perspectives concerning land management (15.3%), the use of fertilizer (16%) and the marketing of products (14.9%)
All three are statistically significant at 5 percent level
In South-east Sulawesi the effects of SAADP on increased knowledge of land management (13.3%) and the use of fertilizer (10.7%) are statistically significant at 1 percent level
From the point of view of the district level, SAADP had a positive effect in all sample areas on all types of additional farming knowledge with the exception of marketing and post-harvest handling of crops in Muna
The impact of SAADP on increased knowledge about the use of pesticides and post-harvest handling of crops is insignificant at both district and provincial levels
Of the four sample districts Muna has the lowest proportion of respondents who feel that they have obtained increased farming knowledge of any kind
As explained above, this situation can be traced to the extremely limited role played by PPLs in providing agricultural extension services
In reality, the fairly high increase in perspectives concerning the use of fertilizer and pesticides in SAADP households is very largely explained by the presence in one of the sample villages of Javanese and Balinese communities that have informally disseminated agricultural knowledge which they obtained from Java
Meanwhile, the rather high proportion of Tolitoli respondents who feel that they have gained additional farming knowledge has been influenced, among other things, by the presence of a local community member who attempted to obtain additional knowledge from the related government agencies at his own initiative
Besides this fact, the role of PPLs at the beginning of the project cannot be ignored, even though they provided extension services only to the heads of groups
This knowledge was then passed on informally to other members of the community, although dissemination was not rapid and not simultaneous in all places
The proportion of SAADP households that have put increased farming knowledge into practice shows a pattern that is almost the same as that for increased knowledge
In the case of control households, however, the pattern is somewhat irregular, even though it reveals a tendency for changes in farming practices to be influenced by greater farming knowledge
Overall, the impact of SAADP on changes in farming practices shows a positive value (see Table 8.3.2)
The highest effect occurred with land management practices (14.8%), which is significant at 5 percent level
The effects on the use of fertilizer (10.0%) and marketing (8.3%) are significant at 1 percent level
While the effects on the use of pesticide and post-harvest handling of crops are not statistically significant
In the specific case of post-harvest handling of crops, there is no statistically significant influence at either district or provincial levels
At the provincial level in both Central Sulawesi and South-east Sulawesi, the impacts of SAADP on improved land management practices are significant at 1 percent level, being 12.2% and 19.4% respectively
The same is true in Tolitoli and Donggala, where the effects are 28.4% and 23.9% respectively
The impact of SAADP on increased use of fertilizer is also significant at 1 percent level in Muna (9.8%) and the Province of South-east Sulawesi (9.7%), while in Tolitoli the impact of 20.1% is significant at 5 percent level
In Tolitoli and Muna, SAADP has had a significant impact at 5 percent level on the use of pesticide (19.8% and 8.6% respectively)
Meanwhile, at the provincial level in Central Sulawesi and in Tolitoli District, SAADP has also had a significant effect on improved marketing practices
Only in Donggala did SAADP display no significant effect on any type of farming practices
By contrast, almost all such practices (with the exception of post-harvest handling of crops) in Tolitoli experienced a significant increase
Community interest in putting new farming knowledge into practice is quite high, where more than 78% of the SAADP and control households that felt their knowledge had increased expressed interest
This would be an extremely positive situation if it were accompanied by efforts to improve community knowledge
The constraint is that only minimum agricultural extension services were provided in almost all study locations
The limited extension services available to communities are also reflected in the small proportion of households that use agricultural inputs in the form of fertilizer and pesticides in all areas except Tolitoli
In the other three districts, the majority of households do not use fertilizer or pesticides at all
In Konsel, the agricultural input most commonly used is herbicide
In Muna, fertilizer and pesticide are applied only to rice and, in very small quantities, to certain horticultural crops
Tree crops and corn, which are generally grown by most members of the community, are usually not given fertilizer or pesticide
Although in general the use of fertilizer and pesticide has remained relatively limited, there are some households that increased their use of these inputs after the SAADP project was introduced
Table 8.3.3 shows that on the whole the proportion of farmers who did so is greater among SAADP households than among control households
SAADP had a positive impact on the use of green fertilizer (9.2%) and pesticide (11.6%) that is significant at 1 percent level, and on the use of chemical fertilizer (8.1%), which is significant at 5 percent level
The impact of SAADP on the use of these three types of agricultural input does not show any statistically significant values in Donggala and Konsel, while in Tolitoli and Muna all three are significant
In managing their land, many farmers clear land by burning trees and rotate the location of their fields
Burning is usually done at the time when land is cleared, whether it be tree-crop land or unused land that belongs to no one
Crop rotation is usually undertaken when secondary food crops (palawija) are planted and is usually done because farmers do not use agricultural inputs, especially fertilizer, which means that natural soil nutrients are soon depleted
Thus farmers have to clear more land every two or three years
Nevertheless, no cases were found in any of the sample locations of households that really practice shifting cultivation
Land that can no longer be planted with palawija crops is normally used for tree crops or else is just abandoned with a few fruit trees or other trees left on it
If tree crops have not been planted, the land is replanted with palawija crops some five years later after natural fertility has been restored
For this reason, the proportion of households that practice only limited shifts in cultivated area is an indicator of the extent to which households apply fertilizer to food crops
In all sample areas, among both SAADP and control households, changes in land rotation and clearing by burning show figures that tend to be negative but are not statistically significant, as can be seen from Table 8.3.4
This indicates a tendency toward improvements in land management systems, with increasingly smaller numbers of households practicing rotation and burning
If the tendency is related to SAADP, the overall impact of SAADP is negative (-0.5%) on burning practices but positive (2.4%) on the rotation of land
Decreases in land rotation were relatively more common among control households while greater decreases in the burning of vegetation occurred among SAADP households
8.4 Household Income
Table 8.4.1 shows that most SAADP respondents (74%) admit that their nominal household income had undergone an increase if compared with the situation before the SAADP project commenced
In Muna more than 90% of SAADP respondents claimed to have experienced a rise in income
Meanwhile, only 65.2% of control households said that their income had risen, while 23.3% stated that it had actually declined
As with SAADP households, the greatest number of control households that experienced an income increase occurred in Muna (82.7%)
The increase in income in Muna is explained by production increases and high prices for agricultural commodities
Increases in the output of certain agricultural products were encouraged by the fact that a number of respondents extended the cultivated area to land that no one owned that at the present time is already productive
Besides that, farmers planted fruit trees like citrus and rambutan, which are now beginning to bear right at a time when prices for these commodities are high
Overall, the difference in the proportion of SAADP and control households that experienced an increase in nominal income was 8.8%, which is statistically significant at 5 percent level
At the provincial level, in South-east Sulawesi there was also a significant positive impact
This indicates that the number of SAADP households that experienced a rise in incomes is greater than the number of control households that did
The opposite happened in Donggala where the SAADP project tended to have a negative impact on improvements in nominal household income, even though the figure is not statistically significant
Among other things, this is related to a situation that enabled control households to undertake diversification in their economic activities, as described in section 8.2
In Konsel and at control households in Tolitoli, the proportion of respondents who stated that there was an increase in their nominal income was smaller than in the other areas
At those household groups, there were a lot of households experienced a decrease in their nominal income
Both in Konsel and Tolitoli, the decrease of nominal income can be traced to the decline in agricultural output as a consequence of the age of the tree or pests attacked
This condition parallel with the average changes in real per capita household income that have a negative value at those group, as shown in Table 8.4.2
Table 8.4.2 also shows that the difference of average changes in real per capita monthly income between SAADP and control households is small (0.5%) although positive, and not statistically significant
This means that the SAADP project tended to have no significant impact on real household income
Furthermore, in Donggala, Muna, and South-east Sulawesi, the average changes in real per capita income at SAADP households are smaller than control households, although again they are not statistically significant
In terms of expenditure, as shown in Table 8.4.3, data indicate that the average changes in real per capita household expenditure in most of households group are negative, with the exception in Muna, South-east Sulawesi, and at SAADP households in Donggala
As with real income, the difference for average changes in real expenditure between SAADP and control households shows an overall positive value (5.4%) but not statistically significant, which is also true for all areas
Again this indicates that SAADP has no significant impact on real household expenditure
8.5 Savings Behavior
Besides being a welfare indicator in the economic sense, savings behavior also constitutes an indicator of a household's financial management planning
A positive difference between household income and expenditure should be retained in the form of savings
As already discussed above, real per capita income in both SAADP and control households on the whole rose, although small, it supposed to provide an incentive for saving
Table 8.5.2 shows that at the time when the research was done, both SAADP and control households which save generally keep their savings in the form of money, with only a few choosing gold (jewelry)
Unlike those in other districts, however, a significant proportion of respondents in Muna from both SAADP and control households prefer to keep savings in the form of gold (jewelry)
Most respondents in the two sample districts in Central Sulawesi save their money in a bank, whereas in the two districts in South-east Sulawesi most still keep money in their house
This habit prevails among both SAADP and control households (see Table 8.5.3)
This can be traced to the fact that community access to banks is better in Central Sulawesi than in South-east Sulawesi
Furthermore, the size of the sum of money that represents savings also influences individual decisions about whether to keep it in a bank or at home
Small sums are usually kept at home, whereas people tend to deposit large sums in a bank
A few respondents keep their savings in a cooperative or else they save in the form of an arisan (rotating savings) or insurance
8.6 Household Facilities and Assets
Improvements in a family's level of welfare can be seen from, among other things, improvements in housing conditions and related facilities and the family's ownership of assets
In the following description, changes in the condition of certain household facilities and assets before and after the introduction of the SAADP project are analyzed to see whether they have improved/increased, are the same, or have worsened/decreased
The housing conditions and facilities that are analyzed include type of roof, walls and floors, source of lighting, clean water, type of fuel and bathroom/toilet facilities (MCK)
Assets take in land, electronic goods, vehicles and livestock
Changes in the condition of houses and their facilities and in the assets that were owned before and after SAADP are presented in Appendix Tables 8.3a to 8.5c
Definitions of improvements or declines in the condition of facilities and houses are given in Appendix Table 8.6
Condition of Houses and Facilities There was very little change in the condition of the majority of houses and associated facilities owned by SAADP and control households
This is in line with qualitative information from a number of resource persons who said that there were generally very few apparent changes in the condition of houses and facilities owned by community members
Data in Appendix Tables 8.3a and 8.3b show that on the whole less than 10% of households undertook improvements to their houses and related facilities
The exception was improvements, made by more than 20% of SAADP and control households, in their main source of home lighting
More SAADP and control households in Tolitoli undertook improvements to their house and its facilities than in other districts
Home lighting was improved by 44.1% of SAADP households and 35.3% of control households
The provision of an electricity network by the State Electricity Company (PLN) encouraged community members in this district to improve sources of lighting
In Muna specifically, a number of households have purchased generators to produce electricity and a few even used SAADP credit for this purpose
The differences in the changes between SAADP and control households are relatively very small (see Appendix Table 8.3c) and there is no clear pattern in values either in the overall sense or by district and province
For example, improvement and decline in the type of roof and the main type of fuel have positive values overall
By contrast, improvement and decline in house flooring and the main source of lighting have negative values
Statistical testing shows that the overall effects of SAADP on the majority of changes in houses and facilities are not statistically significant except in a few instances
a decline in the quality of house flooring (-3.3%), no change (-6.1%) and a worsening (1.2%) in main type of fuel, and a decline in the condition of MCK facilities, all of which are significant at 5 percent level
The impact of SAADP on improvements, lack of change or a decline in roof conditions in Donggala shows a value that is statistically significant but not consistent
The same is true with the condition of house floors in Konsel
Meanwhile, in Tolitoli SAADP had an impact of 14.7%, which is significant at 5 percent level, on expansion in the size of houses
In Konsel the effect of SAADP (12.0%) on worsening conditions for MCK water supplies was also significant at 1 percent level
Ownership of Assets Changes in ownership of valuable goods such as electronic equipment, bicycles and motor-cycles by SAADP and control households are presented in Appendix Tables 8.4a and 8.4b
At the present time more than half of SAADP and control households do not own these items
Virtually all households (99%) do not own a telephone and 88.5% of households do not own a refrigerator
The valuable goods most commonly owned by households are radios and tape recorders
Overall, the effects of SAADP or the differences in changes in ownership of the majority of valuable goods do not show a definite pattern
The same is found in each sample district, as shown in Appendix Table 8.4c
This too is supported by qualitative information from resource persons, who said that there had been no real changes in the condition of houses or related facilities
Overall, SAADP had a significant impact on asset ownership among households that were able to obtain a radio or tape recorder (-6.9%) and those who still had one (9.3%), these figures being significant at 5 percent level
A similar effect occurred among those who still had a bicycle (14%) and those who still did not have one (-14%), the figures being significant at 1 percent level
An examination by district shows that in Muna SAADP had a significant effect at 1 percent level on the increase in households owning a television set (10.7%)
Meanwhile, statistical testing in other districts also showed significant values but in general they refer to situations that remained the same, that is households that still own a certain asset or that still do not own that asset
Changes in land and livestock ownership by SAADP and control households are presented in Appendix Tables 8.5a and 8.5b
Data indicate that all respondents own a home-lot, whereas only a small number (on average less than 5%) own ponds of any kind for aquaculture
The proportion of respondents who experienced an increase in area for all kinds of land tends to be greater than the proportion who experienced a decrease among both SAADP and control households
The proportion of households that do not own any kind of land tends to be greater among control than among SAADP households, except in the case of ownership of tree-crop land
In the case of livestock assets, more respondents own poultry than goats and cattle or water-buffaloes
In terms of change, quite a number of SAADP (21.3%) and control (20.5%) households have increased their ownership of poultry
The proportion of households that own no livestock tends to be greater among control households, except in the case of cattle and water-buffaloes in Tolitoli and goats in Donggala
The SAADP project overall had a positive influence on increased ownership of tree-crop land, irrigated rice-land, home-lots, and fishponds, and also on increased ownership of cattle/water-buffaloes, goats, and poultry, but it is not statistically significant (see Appendix Table 8.5c)
In the specific case of Konsel, the differences in the proportion of SAADP and control households that experienced an increase in their ownership of tree-crop land (15.2%) and irrigated rice-land (5.9%) are significant at 5 percent level
Statistical testing of the difference in the proportion of SAADP and control households shows a significant result only for the unchanged situation as well as a steady decrease in the proportion who do not own any of these assets, especially irrigated rice-land and fishponds as well as poultry
Overall, the differences in the proportion of SAADP and control households that still own the same area of irrigated rice-land (11%) and that own none (-12.5%) are significant at 1 percent level
This is also true in Muna District and at the provincial level in South-east Sulawesi
Meanwhile, in Tolitoli and at the provincial level in Central Sulawesi it is significant in the unchanged situation, figures being 17.6% and 8.3% respectively at 5 percent level
In Konsel, the effect of SAADP on households that do not own irrigated riceland (-17.8%) is significant at 5 percent level
The differences in the proportion of SAADP and control households that own the same area of fishponds and that do not own fishponds show significant values in Konsel (4.0% and 5.0%), at provincial level in South-east Sulawesi (4.4% and 5.4%) and overall (2.8% and 3.3%)
In Muna the difference in the proportion of households that still own the same area of land (4.8%) is significant at 1 percent level
Meanwhile, in the case of livestock ownership SAADP has had a significant impact only on â€œno changeâ€ ownership of cattle and water-buffaloes in Donggala (3.9% at 5 percent level), 
While a significant effect on inchanged poultry ownership occurred in Konsel (13.2% at 5 percent level)
A significant impact also occurred on the proportion of households that do not own poultry in Donggala (-11.5%) and overall (-11.5%), in each case at 5 percent and 1 percent levels respectively
IX THE IMPACT OF SAADP ON POVERTY INCIDENCE
Many countries and donor agencies have introduced micro-credit programs as a means of reducing the incidence of poverty, but research on this topic shows a wide range of results
Research in Bangladesh, for example, indicates that micro-credit can reduce poverty significantly (Khandker, 1998), but other research in the same country suggests that the impact of micro-credit on poverty incidence has been small (Morduch, 1998)
This chapter analyzes the effect of SAADP micro-credit on poverty incidence from two aspects
First, the community groups that have and have not benefited from the loans, and second, the role of SAADP credit in improving household welfare and reducing the incidence of poverty
9.1 Groups That Have Benefited and Those That Have Not
The villages selected for participation in the SAADP project were villages in the poor category according to program criteria outlined in Chapter III
These include villages with a rather large number of poor people, with dry and irrigated land that has potential for development, and with limited economic infrastructure
In Konsel and Muna Districts, for example, the villages selected were the ones that had been affected by drought and by economic crises
While those chosen in Tolitoli and Donggala had been left behind villages
In keeping with the juklak, the targeted beneficiaries were poor families or poor community groups, in particular poor groups and poor farmers who had no source of livelihood, as well as groups of women and youth who were unemployed or did not have regular work
As also pointed out in Chapter III, World Bank staff stressed that in actual fact these criteria were not applied because emphasis was placed on the selection of persons who already had economic activities
The reason for this emphasis was that the program was economic and commercial in nature, which meant that funds lent to the community had to be returned
As a consequence, the beneficiaries, particularly at the revolving stage, were not the poorest groups in the community
This is evident from research findings that show that poverty criteria did not form the main considerations in determining the target of the program
As indicated in section 4.3 above concerning SAADP Participants the Selection Criteria and Process (Table 4.3.1), only 16.7% of households that participated in SAADP felt that they had been selected because they were regarded as poor, while 83.6% said they were chosen because they owned economic undertakings
From the point of view of the education level of respondents, as discussed in section 2.3 concerning Respondents' Experiences in Obtaining Credit (Table 2.3.3), the majority of beneficiaries have a low level of education (have never attended school or have been only to elementary school or the equivalent)
Even so, borrowers with a high school education constitute 22.3% of participants and generally represent the relatively welloff groups in the community
From the point of view of frequency in borrowing, it was the relatively well-off households that tended to obtain loans more often than others, as Table 9.1.1 shows
The proportion of households that received one or two loans is spread fairly evenly over income groups
The majority of households (58.6%) that received three or more loans, however, come from the relatively better-off groups in the community (quintiles IV and V)
Qualitative information obtained in the field strengthens this finding
At the beginning of the project, that is at the time when credit funds were first released, loans were given mainly to poor households
Problems appeared, however, when loans had to be repaid since many participants, in particular those who depended on agriculture or fishing for a livelihood, were unable to pay back the money
Because of this experience, the determining factor in decisions about whether a household would have the opportunity to receive a loan at the next (revolving) stage was its reliability in returning the previous credit
This policy was adopted because the success of the project, and in particular of the UPKD as the financial manager, would be interpreted from, among other things, the increase in funds managed by the UPKD
The consequence was that poor members of the community were no longer given priority in the selection of beneficiaries
Instead, beneficiaries were those who had economic activities or who seemed capable of repaying the credit
The result of this shift in target was that participants from poor or pre-prosperous households declined in number and similarly loans to farmers were restricted
Poor community groups then complained that SAADP micro-credit was more to the advantage of the well-off groups
Even public servants and village officials, encountered during field research, had been able to obtain loans from the UPKD
The relatively large number of credit recipients with a high level of education is an indication that less well educated members of the village community, who on the whole had low incomes, had increasingly fewer opportunities to obtain loans
From what has been said above, the conclusion can be drawn that at the beginning of the project the poor were the group that benefited from SAADP because they received priority in the granting of credit
The opposite occurred, however, at the revolving stage when the opportunity for the poor to obtain loans decreased steadily because ability to repay became the main criterion in selection of participants
9.2 The Role of SAADP in Poverty Reduction
Qualitative information reveals that, after loans were channeled to beneficiaries at the beginning of the project, economic activities in SAADP villages increased
With the availability of the loans, persons who owned small shops or food stalls were able to increase their stock of goods, while many fishermen were able to equip their boats with outboard motors, which enabled them to travel further out to sea
The number of fishing platforms and of traders buying cocoa beans in the sample villages in Donggala also increased greatly
In Muna, participants in sample villages were able to clear new land, making their holdings under tree crops much larger, while stone quarrying and crushing in sample villages in Konsel expanded steadily
Does this relative increase in economic activities among the community in SAADP villages indicate that the SAADP project played a role in poverty reduction
In answer to this question the influence of SAADP on certain aspects of community life will be considered, including the poverty transition and distribution of welfare
The Poverty Transition Table 9.2.1 presents data concerning the proportion of SAADP and control households by poverty status between the pre- and post-SAADP periods
Changes in poverty status have been divided into
still poor, still not poor, a shift from being poor to being not poor, and a shift from being not poor to being poor
Data show that on the whole SAADP had an impact that tended to be positive on household welfare
If a comparison is made with control households, the proportion of SAADP households that were still poor tended to be smaller, while the proportion of households that were still not poor tended to be higher, except in Konsel
The proportion of SAADP households that changed from poor to not poor was higher than the proportion among control households, while the change from not poor to poor tended to be smaller
The overall difference in the proportion of SAADP and control households shows that for households that were still poor (-2.9%) and that changed from not poor to poor (-1.4%) values are negative
While the figures for still not poor (2.7%) and poor to not poor (1.5%) are positive
This means that SAADP tended to have a positive impact on poverty reduction, even though the figures are statistically insignificant
If seen in terms of performance by province, the impact of SAADP on poverty tended to be greater in Central Sulawesi than in South-east Sulawesi
In South-east Sulawesi three of the four indicators of transition from poverty reveal trends that are worse among SAADP households than among control households
Statistical testing shows, however, that the impact of the four indicators at provincial level is also insignificant
In Donggala the proportion of SAADP households in the poor to not poor category (1.9%) is lower than for control households
In other words, the change in control household welfare tends to be better than in SAADP households
This can be explained by qualitative information that more women in control households weave cloth as an economic activity
Even so, the impact of SAADP on poverty transition in this district is also statistically insignificant
The poverty transition among SAADP households was better than among control households in Tolitoli
The impact of SAADP can be seen from the difference between the proportions of SAADP and control households that were still poor (-17.6%) and between the proportions that were poor but became not poor (13.7%)
This is the greatest difference among the four districts and both figures are statistically significant at 5 percent level
The effect of SAADP on poverty transition in this district is the most striking of all areas
Qualitative information obtained in Tolitoli indicates that SAADP loans led to increased use of fertilizer and pesticide on cocoa trees and this in turn raised production
SAADP in this are had a positive impact on poverty incidence in this district to farmers who usually are poor households
The effects of SAADP on changes in poverty in Muna are somewhat inconsistent
The difference in the proportion of SAADP and control households that moved from poor to not poor is 8.5% but the figure is insignificant, while the difference from not poor to poor is 3.8%, which is significant at the 5 percent level
There are indications that the level of welfare in control households is higher than in SAADP households
According to qualitative information, increasingly more persons from the control village have gone to Malaysia over the past two or three years as migrant workers and are employed as plantation laborers or in the non-agricultural sector
In Konsel the difference between SAADP and control households is such that three out of the four indicators for poverty transition are worse in the SAADP than in the control households
The proportion of SAADP households that are still poor is 12.1% higher than that of control households
At the same time the proportion of SAADP households that are still not poor is 15.2% lower than the proportion of control households
Apart from that, even though the difference is not very great, Konsel is the only district in which the proportion of SAADP households that moved from not poor to poor tends to be higher than among control households
It seems likely that this is related to the frequency of crop failure due to pests that attacked the tree-crop land of SAADP households
In addition, there is a sawmill in the control village that makes a contribution to the village economy
The Distribution of Welfare One of the objectives of SAADP was to reduce the gap in welfare within the community
It was hoped that this would be achieved by raising the standard of living of poor groups, so that the gap between them and better-off groups in the community would become smaller
Table 9.2.2 shows changes in the Gini Ratio of household expenditure in SAADP and control households between the time before SAADP commenced and after its conclusion
From this table it can be seen that of the four SAADP districts, only Muna in South-east Sulawesi experienced an increase in inequality after implementation of the SAADP program
In the other three districts there was a decrease, even though it was relatively small
This means that in Muna the welfare level of the gap had risen by the end of the program, while in Donggala, Tolitoli and Konsel there was a drop
Overall the Gini Ratio decreased by 0.0078
Meanwhile, the figures for the Gini Ratio among control households in all four sample districts show an overall decrease of 0.0383
If figures for SAADP and control households in all districts except Muna are compared, it can be seen that in Donggala and Konsel the decrease in the Gini Ratio among SAADP households is greater than among control households
By contrast, in Tolitoli the decrease in the Gini Ratio is smaller in SAADP than in control households
On the whole, the decrease among control households is greater than among SAADP participants by 0.0305
This indicates that the decrease in the level of the welfare gap is smaller among SAADP participants than among control households
Other Welfare Indicators Other welfare indicators that can be used to examine the impact of SAADP on poverty incidence include changes in the capacity of the poor to finance children's education, access health facilities, participate in traditional ceremonies and face economic shocks (see Table 9.2.3)
In this table, poor households are those that, prior to the beginning of SAADP, were below the poverty line in their provinces
Capacity to finance children's education
On the whole, the proportion of poor SAADP households that experienced a rise in their ability to pay for children's education was 11.0% higher than the proportion of control households that were also poor, but this difference is statistically insignificant
Only in Konsel did the impact of SAADP on ability to finance education (33.0%) show an influence that was statistically significant at 1 percent level
In Donggala and Tolitoli, the effect of SAADP on the increased ability was positive, while in Muna it was negative
Statistically, however, these figures are not significant
According to qualitative information, the educational facilities available in most villages in both Central and South-east Sulawesi are limited to elementary schools (SD)
With the increase in the number of households with greater economic capacity and supported by strong motivation on the part of parents, more and more children have been able to continue their education at a higher level (junior and senior high school and tertiary level)
This trend has also been supported by the family culture and the spirit of mutual assistance, which are still strong in all villages and include help with education
Usually village children who wish to go on to a higher level of schooling are entrusted to relatives or friends in the district or provincial capital in order to reduce expenditure on accommodation
Capacity in access to health services
On the whole, the proportion of poor SAADP households that said that their ability to access health services had risen was 9.7% greater than among control households but the figure is statistically insignificant
In Tolitoli and Konsel the effects of SAADP on increased capacity to obtain health services were respectively 35.0% (significant at 1 percent level) and 28.0% (significant at 5 percent level)
At the provincial level in Central Sulawesi the impact (15.9%) was statistically significant at 5 percent level
By contrast, for households in Donggala and Muna, the effect of SAADP on this capacity tended to be negative, even though the figures are statistically insignificant
Capacity to participate in traditional ceremonies
Overall, the proportion of poor SAADP households that experienced a rise in their ability to participate in traditional ceremonies was 10.2% higher than among control households that were also poor, but the figure is statistically insignificant
The same was found at provincial level
Only in Konsel did this indicator show a statistically significant figure at 5 percent level (23.7%)
Meanwhile, in Donggala the impact of SAADP tended to show a negative influence that was insignificant
Capacity to face economic shocks
The proportion of poor SAADP households that have experienced increased capacity to face economic shocks is 4.3% higher than the proportion of poor control households, but the figure is again statistically insignificant
In Donggala and Muna the proportion of control households with greater capacity to face economic shocks is higher than among SAADP households
In Muna, the effect (-26.5%) is statistically significant at 5 percent level, while in Donggala (-2.9%) it is insignificant
On the whole, it can be said that the effect of SAADP on the poverty transition, although positive, is small and insignificant
If each district is examined, influences are inconsistent; the greatest effect, however, occurred in Tolitoli
The impact of SAADP on reductions in the gap in household welfare is also small and in fact is less than in control households
The effect of SAADP on other welfare indicators is generally statistically insignificant although positive
Only in Konsel has SAADP had a significant impact on the four additional welfare indicators, while in Tolitoli it has had an effect only on increased capacity in two of the four indicators
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2007 TEACHER CERTIFICATION PROGRAM 
I Background 
In an effort to set standards and increase the quality of teachers, in 2007 the Ministry of National Education (MoNE) and the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MoRA) began to implement a teacher certification program
Teacher certification applies to teachers in public and private schools, across all levels of schooling, and aims to improve the quality of teachers, learning, and education in Indonesia in a holistic and ongoing manner
Participants in the certification program are teachers that have, as a minimum, an undergraduate degree (S1) or four-year diploma (D4) who are selected based on a set of ordered criteria
They are required to compile and submit portfolios for assessment against set standards
Teachers deemed to pass, either directly through portfolio assessment or after undertaking a remedial training course, receive a certificate, a teacher registration number, and a professional allowance to the value of one month's basic salary
In 2008 The SMERU Research Institute undertook a study of the 2007 certification program in Jambi, West Java, and West Kalimantan to understand its implementation process and perceptions of the parties involved on whether there was any influence on the quality of teachers and learning
II Findings Implementing Organizations 
In general, implementing organizations (MoNE, MoRA, and institutions for the education of teaching staff/LPTK) implemented the program in line with the requirements
However, there is also evidence of a lack of coordination between different implementing institutions
This could be seen in situations where teachers were asked to be certified through the wrong ministry, or both ministries
Socialization 
MoNE and MoRA held formal socialization sessions for both implementing institutions and participating teachers
However, as funds were not set aside specifically for socialization, socialization activities by kabupaten (district)/kota (city) level offices varied between study areas and not all implementing institutions provided the certification guidebook for participating teachers
Participants' understanding of certification improved in the second year, but understanding of the details of the professional allowance remained limited
MoNE opened a community services unit to handle complaints, but information about the unit was not available in the guidebook for participants, and participants generally did not know that it existed
Determination of Quotas 
The number of certification participant quotas varied between provinces and kabupaten/kota
Quotas in every study area were unfilled due to inaccurate data, and the fact that quotas were based on the total number of teachers, but participants were determined based on whether they had an undergraduate degree
There were also disproportionate numbers of teachers with S1/D4 across regions
MoRA kabupaten/kota officers and teachers thought that the quota MoRA received was too small
Determination of Participants 
Generally kabupaten/kota education offices chose participants based on a set of ordered criteria, with length of teaching experience the most important criteria
However, in a limited number of cases determination of participants was not transparent, 
and there were participants who had less work experience than those who were not chosen to become participants
Portfolio Compilation 
Although a guidebook for teachers was supplied, many participants did not fully understand the technical aspects of the portfolio compilation
Teachers also experienced difficulty in collecting old documents and certificates, making lesson plans, and compiling the portfolio in the limited time provided
There were reports of falsified training and seminar certificates and plagiarized lesson plans
This was rectified in 2008, when participants were required to provide original documents
Participants spent between Rp100,000 to Rp500,000 on various costs associated with portfolio compilation
Portfolio Assessment 
The percentage of participants who passed directly from portfolio assessment was relatively low and varied between areas
There were no indications of deception or deviations in the portfolio assessment
However, there are indications of high subjectivity from assessors
Remedial Training and Passing Rates 
A large proportion of participants undertook the remedial training course
Participants considered the remedial training course beneficial, with relevant and useful course material and competent instructors
Generally remedial training participants passed the course, so information spread that all certification candidates would pass, and it was only the stage at which they passed that would differ
At the time the study was conducted none of the teachers had received teacher registration numbers, and only a few participants from West Kalimantan had received teaching certificates
Professional Allowance 
The payment of the professional allowance has been delayed
Only 2006 quota participants have received the allowance, 
and only for the first quarter (October-December 2007), not for the following quarters
At the time this study was conducted, in June 2008, it was not certain when the professional allowance would be paid
Impacts of the Program 
Certification's impact on the quality of teachers is uncertain because it is not designed to identify qualified teachers and is based only on assessments of portfolios which cover pre-existing administrative documents
However, teachers have been encouraged to continue their studies and actively participate in various activities in order to obtain certificates for their portfolios
Certification has also given rise to document and portfolio compilation services
The requirement to teach 24 hours per week has also made many teachers seek additional teaching hours in their schools or in other schools
III Recommendations 
Wider distribution of clear and consistent information about the division of authority between MoNE and MoRA, both for implementing organizations as well as teachers
This must be supported by good coordination and the two organizations should use similar standards in implementing the program, especially in determining participants
To maintain objectivity in the determination of participants, the selection criteria must be transparent and the ranked list of teachers who fulfill the criteria should be easily accessed by teachers
Control mechanisms for certification implementation must be optimized, including by having existing monitoring institutions, implementing institutions, and independent institutions conduct staged monitoring
The existence of a complaints body should be communicated widely and at the various government levels, with a clear complaints resolution mechanism
In addition, there must be strict sanctions for the various forms of deception or deviations which occur
To better ensure that the objective of certification, i.e., to increase the quality of teachers and education, is met, the performance of teachers who pass certification should be assessed periodically based on their pedagogical, professional, personal, and social skills

ABSTRACT
The Implementation of the Community-Based Monitoring System in Kota Pekalongan, Indonesia
In formulating policies and development plans, the government needs accurate and updated data
The regional governments, especially at the district level, have started to play a very strategic role in the implementation of development plans in their territory since the central government enacted the law on regional autonomy
The results of the Community-Based Monitoring System (CBMS) pilot project in Indonesia show that the system can accurately enumerate regions based on the family welfare category
Moreover, it can predict the family welfare enumeration which is highly accurate and completely consistent with what the local people say about the family welfare status, especially the poor's
The results were presented to the Kota Pekalongan stakeholders, and the local government was interested in implementing the data collection system in their city; it became the first district in Indonesia to officially implement the CBMS
Given Indonesia's geographical size and the decentralization that puts more power at the hands of the district governments in determining poverty alleviation programs, we believe that this monitoring system is the most suitable for Indonesia
The objective of the CBMS data collection in Kota Pekalongan was to get comprehensive data, that can be accessed, used, and analyzed by the local government agencies and other institutions under the administration of the Kota Pekalongan Government
Moreover, the results of this data collection could be used as recommendations to the Kota Pekalongan government, especially when they were making development plans and budget

I INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
In formulating policies and development plans, the government needs accurate and updated data
Regional governments, especially kabupaten (district) or kota (city) governments, have started to play a very strategic role in the implementation of development plans in their territory since the central government enacted the law on regional autonomy
According to the law, regional governments have more weight in running the government administration
They should not just go along with what is instructed by the central government
They have the authority to design a policy plan, draw up their own budget, and implement the policy, especially that related to development, public order, infrastructures, health, education, social problem solving, labor, civil administration, etc
Since the law was upheld, regional governments have achieved considerable progress with regard to public services such as access to education and health facilities
They, however, are still faced with a number of problems, especially those related to planning and budgeting system, such as the process of determining the targets of some programs and projects
Data is a very crucial element for the regional government specifically and the private parties or other institutions in general in the planning and budgeting process of a program or project
In 2005, The SMERU Research Institution introduced a data collection system called the Community-Based Monitoring System (CBMS), which has been tried out at four villages in Kabupaten Cianjur and Kabupaten Demak
The system utilizes a list of intelligible questions and involves the local community members in the implementation
The data collected and the information gathered were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively
The quantitative analysis was done based on the Principal Components Analysis (PCA), which is a statistics method that reduces dataset multidimensionality but at the same time maintains as many variations in the dataset as possible
The results of the CBMS tryouts at the four villages show that the system can accurately enumerate regions, at the dusun or RW levels, based on the family welfare category
It can also predict the family welfare enumeration which is highly accurate and completely consistent with what the local people say about the family welfare status, especially the poor's
The results were presented before the stakeholders of Kota Pekalongan
The local government was interested in implementing the data collection system in their city and it became the first of all the kabupaten/kota in Indonesia to officially implement the system
Preparation for the CBMS data collection of family welfare had been made since 2007
Unlike the tryouts in Kabupaten Cianjur and Kabupaten Demak, the CBMS data collection in Kota Pekalongan as the local government required was comprehensive; the data collected can be accessed, used, and analyzed by the local government work unit (SKPD) and other institutions under the administration of the Kota Pekalongan Government
This data collection can hopefully reduce the time and money spent for data collections done separately by each office of Kota Pekalongan Administration
This report gives the analysis results of the data collected in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan and Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur (2008) and in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara and Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat (2009)
1.2 Kota Pekalongan Profile
Kota Pekalongan is located 384 kilometers from Jakarta (the capital province of Indonesia) and 101 km from Kota Semarang (the capital city of Central Java Province); it is administratively divided into four kecamatan (subdistricts), namely Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan, Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur, Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara, and Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat
Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan occupies a land of 10.80 km2 and is divided into 11 kelurahan, 64 RW, and 247 RT, with a population size of 50,198 and a population density of 4,648 per km2
In 2007, there were 12,592 households in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan
Of the total residents, 50.46% are female
Most of the residents work in garment or batik factories or batik making home industry
On the other hand, with an area of 9.52 km2, Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur is divided into 13 kelurahan, 79 RW, and 378 RT
Its population size is 63,045 with a population density of 6,662 per km2
In 2007, there were 15,742 households in the area
Like Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan, there are more women than men in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur, with the ratio of 51.99% to 48.01%
Some kelurahan in that kecamatan such as Kelurahan Jenggot, Kelurahan Buaran, Kelurahan Banyu Ageng, and Kelurahan Banyu Alit are known as the places of origin of Indonesian migrant workers who work in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia
In Kelurahan Noyontaan, on the other hand, there are some textile factories and a tea factory where the local people work
Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara occupies a land of 14.88 km2 and is divided into 9 kelurahan, 82 RW, and 399 RT, with a population size of 71,753 inhabitants and a population density of 4,822 per km2
In 2007, there were 17,810 households in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara
Most of the residents work in garment/batik factories or batik making home industry or as fishers
Of the total residents, 51.3% are women
On the other hand, with an area of 10.05 km2, Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat is divided into 13 kelurahan, 90 RW, and 442 RT
Its population size is 86,994 with a population density of 8,656 per km2
In 2007, there were 21,056 households in the area
Like in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara, there are more women than men in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat, with the ratio of 51.58% to 48.42%
1.3 Poverty Profile of Kota Pekalongan
This section pictures the poverty profile of Kota Pekalongan as a whole, rather than an analysis by kecamatan
The data is taken from secondary data from Statistics Indonesia (BPS)
The poverty profile based on the PCA analysis by kecamatan will be shown in Chapter IV
For almost a decade, from 2002 to 2007, there was a decreasing trend in the number of people living below the poverty line as well as with the poverty rate in Pekalongan
Table 2 shows that the regional poverty rates in Pekalongan were remarkably lower than those at the national level
In this period, the poverty rates were always below 10%, a high achievement compared to other regions
An exception to this trend was in 2006, when the poverty rate increased to 7.38% from 6.37% the previous year, and the number of poor people also leaped to 19,900 from 17,500 in 2005
The government policy to increase domestic fuel prices by an average of 120 percent in late 2005 was the main reason for this jump
The hikes in fuel prices led to increases in the prices of commodities, particularly the price of rice, the commodity that has the highest share of consumption among the poor
In 2008, there were significant differences in the figures showing the number of poor people, the poverty rate, and the poverty line data
This was possible because the Statistics Indonesia implemented new methodology on poverty measurement in that year, causing a jump in the numbers for those three indicators compared with the previous years
Table 2 shows the depth of poverty using the poverty gap ratio (P1)
Poverty gap ratio is used to measure the distance between the average income of the poor and the poverty line
From the data we can see that the poverty gap in Pekalongan was quite fluctuant
Compared with 2006, the poverty gap showed an improvement in 2007
In 2008, however, the poverty gap increased in comparison with 2007
Implying a decline in the total expenditure of the poor
Another indicator used to examine income poverty from various angles is the poverty severity index (P2), which is the result of the expenditure disparity of the poor multiplied by the poverty line
This index gives higher weight to those who live below the poverty line
An improvement in the poverty severity index shows an improvement for those who are extremely poor (National Development Planning Agency, 2007)
The poverty severity index in Pekalongan was also quite fluctuant
From 0.27 in 2002, it decreased to 0.13 in the next year, and then rose again in the period of 2005-2006
In 2008, the index declined slightly in comparison to that of 2007
1.4 Objective of CBMS Data Collection
The data collection or the family welfare census in Kota Pekalongan was aimed at getting information and/or accurate and comprehensive data on the social condition and welfare status of households in the city
The data collected included the charateristics of household heads, households' consumptions, the conditions of houses and facilities, goods or valuable assets ownership, loans and savings, participation in development and politics, access to information as well as to government programs in education, health, and infrastructures
The data and information gathered were then analyzed in order to get a profile of the social condition, welfare status, number of unemployment, and poverty in the area
In addition, the analysis of the results of this data collection could be used as recommendations to the Kota Pekalongan government, especially when they were making development plans and budget
II PUBLIC CONSULTATION WORKSHOP AND CBMS MODULES
2.1 Preliminary Consultation Workshop
SMERU conducted a consultation workshop for the staff of Kota Pekalongan Government to introduce the CBMS data collection
Based on the results of the tryouts in four villages in Kabupaten Cianjur and Kabupaten Demak, SMERU found it necessary to collect the data of community welfare at household level
The CBMS records the multidimensional welfare of households on 63 indicators and the data obtained can be used by the offices of the kabupaten/kota government
The system involves the local people in enumerating households, resulting in better quality data
Besides, welfare indicators vary depending on local characteristics just like the indicators determined by using the PCA method
With the CBMS, the data cannot be manipulated since the welfare indicators are determined after the data is collected
The results of the data collection and analysis are highly accurate
This fact was verified during the focus group discussions (FGDs) with the local community leaders, religious leaders, village administration staff, medical workers, teachers, and community members
The verification results show that the CBMS can accurately enumerate the family welfare in a village at RW or dusun level
Moreover, they also show that the CBMS are able to predict the family welfare enumeration with high accuracy
The number is highly consistent with what the local people say about the family welfare, especially that of the poor's
From the CBMS data collection, city planners and the government at the kabupaten/kota level can plan programs or projects to be set for certain areas
With limited budget, they can then select which sectors are to be prioritized
education, health, clean water, or other infrastructures
Accurate data is needed as the fundamentals for planning and serves to reduce the risk of manipulations of poverty eradication programs
It takes strong commitment on the part of the government to get accurate data
The CBMS is a monitoring system with a reliable methodology that takes into account the local condition in enumerating levels of people's welfare
Therefore, the Kota Pekalongan Government was determined to conduct data collection by using the CBMS and by adding a number of required variables
2.2 Follow-Up Consultation Workshop
The SMERU consultation workshop for the staff members of Kota Pekalongan Government, especially the regional government work unit (SKPD), emphasized the development of variables needed for the questionnaires
Basic questions list used during the CBMS tryouts was perfected and elaborated to make the questionnaires comprehensive so that they could be used by all the offices of Kota Pekalongan Government
In this consultation, all the offices, especially the national education agency and the Community Empowerment Board (Bapermas), gave valuable inputs to the CBMS question list in Kota Pekalongan
The perfecting and the elaborating of the question list included the breakdown of the relationship between the family members and the family head, educational background of the enumerated family members, school being attended, profession, whether or not the family members had been on hajj, whether or not they were senior citizens, and whether or not they had physical or mental disabilities
In addition, the families' access to the local government's programs, aside from those of the central government's, such as plasterwork of their house, toilet and well provisions, house renovations, and other programs were also taken into account
They are, however, local specific
The respondent families' reactions to economic problems such as the rise in the prices of basic needs, fluctuations of their income for six months, the kind of work they did, additional sources of income, and whether or not they had family business (home industry, small/medium/large industry, or service industry) were also included
2.3 Legalization of MoU of CBMS Data Collection
The third consultation workshop was conducted more formally prior to the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the head of Kota Pekalongan and the executive director of The SMERU Research Institute
After that, on 17 July 2008, a technical meeting was held with regard to the CBMS data collection plan, attended by 32 participants comprising various stakeholders such as the head of Statistics Indonesia of Kota Pekalongan, the head and staff of the Bappeda, academics from Universitas Pekalongan, staff members of the local governments (Bapermas staff, heads of kecamatan, the forum of heads of kelurahan), and activists from PATTIRO
In this discussion forum, the stakeholders agreed to the plan of implementing the CBMS data collection in Kota Pekalongan by accommodating the interests of Kota Pekalongan government offices
The technical team then followed it up by perfecting and elaborating the question list
The discussion between SMERU and the technical team specifically focused on elaborating the question list on the questionnaires for both families and RT staff
The result was then tried out to several households in order to get inputs from both the enumerators and the respondents regarding the comprehensibility of the questions
Before the team of enumerators could do their work, the Kota Pekalongan Government represented by the Bappeda disseminated the CBMS data collection plan to the heads of kecamatan, kelurahan staff, kelurahan-level PKK
These people then informed their citizens about the data collection plan
To conduct the CBMS data collection in Kota Pekalongan, SMERU prepared two sets of questionnaires one for the families and the other for RT staff and the guidelines on how to do the questionnaires
The family questionnaire was used to record the data of every family in the city, while the one for RT staff was used to get information from the staff in every chosen area
For this purpose, the Kota Pekalongan Government formed a CBMS team under the directive of the head of Bappeda of Kota Pekalongan No 050/1686/2008 on the Establishment of the CBMS Team of Year 2008 (Appendix 1)
The team was divided into four smaller teams
the managing team, the technical team, the advocacy team, and the secretariat
The managing team consisted of eight members, mostly senior ranking officials in their respective agencies
Its role was to give directions and/or instructions to the technical and secretariat teams to ensure the success of the CBMS activities
The technical team consisted of 24 members; most of them staff of Bappeda and other government agencies of Kota Pekalongan, PATTIRO Pekalongan, and the academics from Universitas Pekalongan
The advocacy team consisted of SMERU researchers
This team played the role of mentors and gave technical assistances throughout the whole process to ensure the success of the CBMS activities
The secretariat consisted of five members, all of them Bappeda staff
2.4 Questionnaire Guidelines
The guidelines on how to do the questionnaires were made as a controlling tool so that everybody involved would have similar perceptions on the questions
The guidelines included details on how to do the interview, how to do the questioning, and explanations of the questions in the family questionnaire, from the general explanations to the detailed ones on every question
The guidelines would serve as guidance and reference not only for the trainers during the training for the kecamatan- and kelurahan-level coordinators and enumerators but also for the kelurahan-level coordinators when they were giving explanations to the enumerators in their areas
For more details of the questionnaire guidelines, see Appendix 2
2.5 Family Questionnaire
The family questionnaire used in Kota Pekalongan CBMS data collection was created based on the CBMS tryouts in Kabupaten Cianjur and Kabupaten Demak
Some questions relevant to the information or data needed by the Kota Pekalongan offices (local contexts) were also added
In this questionnaire, the term family in this data collection referred to the Law No 23/2006 on Civil Administration
The law states that the Family Card (KK) is a family identity card that contains the names, the relationships, and the identity of family members
If a couple already has a family card, even if they still live with their parents, the couple is considered as one family
There were, however, cases in which some families do not have a family card and these cases needed clarification
(i) a married couple is regarded as one family even though they do not have a family card
(ii) a woman who gets pregnant and gives birth to a child out of a wedlock is regarded as a family, and the child gets the status as the woman's offspring
(iii) a woman and a man who get married under the religious law (sirri) and then have children are considered as one family, and the head of the family is the man
(iv) if a man marries two or more women, he is regarded as the head only in his first marriage, while in the second marriage, his second wife is regarded as the family head
and (v) if one family lives at a kelurahan but administratively registered as residents of another kelurahan, then they are recorded in the data based on the civil administration document
The family questionnaire comprised seven types of questions on the characteristics of the head and members of a family, poverty reduction, the family's health, economic condition, participations in area development, security, and information and communication technology
For more details of the questionnaires, see Appendix 3
After the consultation workshops and the drafting of the CBMS questionnaires, the family questionnaire was then tried out on a number of families in Kelurahan Kraton Lor, Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara
The aim of the tryout was to make sure that the questionnaire was comprehensible and similarly perceived by the data enumerators and respondents
Otherwise, the questionnaires were to be refined
It also tried to find out the time required to interview a family
III METHODOLOGY AND DATA PROCESSING
3.1 Data Collection Method
The data collection or census in Kota Pekalongan used the Community-Based Monitoring System (CBMS), which is a system to monitor the community welfare supported by and done with the local people's active participation
Basically, the CBMS data collection was done by the Kota Pekalongan Government themselves with some technical assistance provided by SMERU
Funding for technical assistance is provided by the International Development Research Center (IDRC), Canada, through the CBMS Network Coordinating Team which is based at the Angelo King Institute for Economic and Business Studies, De La Salle University, Manila
The CBMS data collection method used a structured questionnaire for collecting information on households
The information and data collected was then analyzed using descriptive analysis and principal components analysis, known as the PCA
By using the PCA, the data can show the welfare enumeration (or poverty enumeration) of the households in an area
This method can also help identify variables that affect the level of family welfare in an area more specifically, as the welfare status or poverty factors vary in different regions
The family questionnaire used in Kota Pekalongan CBMS data collection was created based on the CBMS tryouts in Kabupaten Cianjur and Kabupaten Demak
Some questions relevant to the information or data needed by the Kota Pekalongan government offices (local contexts) were also added
Every family gets the same set of questions
3.2 Data Collection Process
The CBMS data collection in Kota Pekalongan was done through trainings and the process of collecting the data itself
Considering the large number of households in Kota Pekalongan and the local government's budget allocated for this activity for two years, the CBMS data collection was done in two stages
the first covered Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan and Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur in 2008 and the second one covered Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara and Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat in 2009
The first training was held in the beginning of August 2008 and the data collection training for the second census was held in August 2009
The activities consist of training for prospective trainers, training for kecamatan- and kelurahan-level coordinators, and training for enumerators
It is a part of the capacity building program for government staff, academics, nongovernment institutions (NGOs), and the community in general in Kota Pekalongan
The trainings were conducted consecutively and followed by several days of supervision
Despite what the CBMS team had learned from the 2008 census, they still faced the same problems in 2009
Problems arise during the trainings and the enumeration process, namely
(i) some enumerators did not follow the training
(ii) some enumerators were only primary school graduates or above 55 years old
(iii) some enumerators turned out to be government staff members
and (iv) some enumerators followed the training but asked others (family members or relatives) to do the survey
These facts resulted in incorrect or incomplete filling out of the questionnaires, which in turn affected the data entry
3.3 Data Entry Process
The data entry activities (including data entry training) of the 2008 CBMS of Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan and Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur were done by CV (Comanditer Venootschap) Waditra, a company that runs its business in the sector of information and technology
It had been a partner of Kota Pekalongan Government for five years
There were 28,249 households recorded and the data output was in a web-based or MySQL format
On the other hand, training on data entry for the 2009 CBMS data in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara and Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat was done by the SMERU Research Institute
There were 42,230 households recorded using CSpro and the data output was in STATA format
Since the 2008 data was handled by CV Wadistra, each questionnaire did not have an identification number which could have been used to simplify the cleaning process
The data entry system gave an identification (ID) number in a sequential order
The questionnaire ID number, however, is only attached to the head of family's ID number
In each of the 2009 questionnaires, SMERU gave an identification number manually, resulting in longer time for the data entry process
The 2009 data entry format was made by SMERU and was different from that of 2008 data, meaning that the data entry people were required to follow the training
There are, however, some of them who did not join the training
The other problem in 2009 was the shortage of computers compared with the number of data entry people
As the data entry system was not in a web-based format and the number of computer was not sufficient, one computer was shared by two data entry people who had to use it in turns
3.4 Data Cleaning Process
Data cleaning process means checking the differences between the actual data stated in the questionnaire and what the data entry people have entered in the data entry format
It also means checking whether or not the structured questions in the questionnaire had been filled in correctly by the enumerator
There were differences in the process of cleaning the 2008 and 2009 data
The 2008 CBMS data was in a different format so the process included transferring the data into the STATA format and matching the ID number with the family questionnaire
Some data sets were attached to the questionnaires ID and some others were attached to the ID of the family head
The family characteristics data, on the other hand, were attached to only the ID of the family members
The process for matching those IDs was quite difficult
Tracking the original questionnaire sheets was also a problem
SMERU, assisted by CV Wadistra, had to find the original sheets based on the names of the respondents and their kelurahan
They also had to check the names of respondents' family members upon finding respondents with similar names
The 2009 data cleaning process was quite challenging in terms of checking the answers to the structured questions with the statistical software (STATA)
The SMERU data entry system was used for the process
The problem was that the data entry people who were not familiar with the software or did not follow the data entry training entered some data into the wrong cells
For example, the answer to question number 2 was put into the cell for question number 3 simply because the data entry person did not pay attention to the entry column
In general, the data entry was not accurate
The data cleaning process involved identifying every question whose answer had been put into the wrong cell and matching them
The different data entry formats also caused another problem
Some questions allowed the participants to give more than one answer and their answers had to be put in ranks
Because some of the 2008 data did not match questionnaire format, we had to make some adjustments to the 2009 data format so both data can be combined
After going through several cleaning processes, the number of reliable household data went down about 1 percent, from 70,470 to 69,840 households
Therefore, the analyses in the next chapters are made based on the household data mentioned the last
3.5 Capacity Building
A number of trainings were held as capacity building activities for the local community and government staff members
This ensures that knowledge and skills are shared and retained by the local people
a) CBMS introductory training was a capacity building activity for the staff members of the local government and related government agencies
In this training, the CBMS initiatives, including its benefits, methodology, and activities that entail were introduced
The participants were the head of Kota Pekalongan, head of Bappeda and staff, officials of related government agencies (health, education, etc.) and the Kota Pekalongan office of Statistics Indonesia
This training was aimed at increasing the awareness, interest, and understanding of the stakeholders regarding the CBMS
b) Training for prospective trainers was held at the Bappeda office
In this training, every census instrument was discussed and modified by the technical team, adding questions to cater to the local conditions
The participants were staff members of PATTIRO and the University of Pekalongan
On a different occasion, they gave training to enumerators in every kelurahan
c) Training for kelurahan-level coordinators were attended by 26 coordinators (4 from kecamatan level and 24 from kelurahan level)
The kelurahan-level coordinators were to assist the technical team and SMERU in supervising the process of questionnaire completion, reviewing and collecting the completed questionnaires, and submitting the questionnaires to the kecamatan/kelurahan-level coordinators
d) Training for enumerators was held in their respective kelurahan, attended by 15-30 enumerators per kelurahan
The enumerators were local people, mostly homemakers, who have spare time to conduct the census during the day
They came from various educational backgrounds from primary school graduates to S1 degree holders but the majority of them were senior high school graduates
e) Training on data entry was held by SMERU, attended by 60 participants divided into two groups
The training materials consisted of the techniques of entering data into the computer, Access, and basic CSPro as the database software
There were 42,230 households recorded using the CSpro and the data output was in STATA format
Figure 1 shows the coordination channels among the institutions and their roles during the CBMS implementation, from the development of questionnaires to the training for and supervision of enumerators as well as the data cleaning process
IV MDGs AND PCA RESULTS
4.1 Millennium Development Goals Achievements in Kota Pekalongan
Economists and policymakers have been debating over the dichotomy of growth versus equity for the last few decades
The theoretical mechanism linking poverty, inequality, and growth has made this issue very attractive for debate
The basic conclusion from empirical studies suggests that growth and equity are complementary in some fundamental dimensions of development (Bourguignon, 2007)
In addition, other empirical results have shown that developments focusing on distribution and equity have a more positive impact on the society (Bappenas, 2007)
The United Nations (UN) actively raised the discourse of development to promote human welfare
They saw the fruits of their efforts at the Millennium Summit in New York in September 2000
The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were first launched as an agreement of 189 member states of the UN at the Summit
The eight MDGs, which connect various development goals into a global agenda, are
(i) to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
(ii) to achieve universal primary education
(iii) to promote gender equality and empower women
(iv) to reduce child mortality
(v) to improve maternal health
(vi) to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases
(vii) to ensure environmental sustainability
and (viii) to develop a global partnership for development
The eight goals have been translated into measureable targets and their progress is reported through verifiable and internationally comparable indicators
The MDGs, however, are not the goals of the UN, even though they have worked hard to carry out a global campaign on these matters and to help countries to realize the goals
The MDGs are goals adopted by countries through their governments
In Indonesia, the central government should work together with the regional and local governments, the parliament, the civil society, the mass media, and other stakeholders in order to reach the goals (UNDP Indonesia, 2004)
The MDGs are not new in the context of development in Indonesia
Ever since the country's proclamation for independence, every administration under each of the presidents has focused on a certain development framework
For example, in the New Order Era, Indonesia had Five-Year Development Plans (REPELITA), starting with REPELITA I in 1969 and ending with REPELITA VI in 1994, which was disrupted by the 1997 financial crisis
Following the fall of the New Order Government and the transition era, Indonesia developed a similar document on development planning, called the 2004-2009 National Midterm Development Plan (RPJMN)
The latest version of this is the 2010-2014 RPJMN
The RPJMN contains guidance to both the national and local governments on policies and programs for five years, based on the vision and mission of the elected president
The inclusion of the MDGs into the RPJMN and other documents on poverty alleviation programs implies that the government remains consistent in treating the MDGs not only as a declaration of good intentions, but also as something that should be supported with definite actions (Bappenas, 2007)
As mentioned before, achieving the MDGs is not the responsibility of the central government alone
All stakeholders, including the regional governments, should play their role
At the time of writing, a report keeping tracks of the attainment of the goals was only available at the national level, while in fact, it would be more useful to have reports on the progress of the MDGs at the kabupaten and kecamatan level since the problems being faced are more concentrated at the grassroots level
Before the decentralization period, provision of data for the purposes of planning, monitoring, and evaluation may have been of minor importance
The information and data on the condition of their people is needed, so that they can figure out which development programs are appropriate to meet the people's needs, how they can accelerate the development, which groups need more attention, or which kecamatan/area should get immediate priority
On the other hand, conducting surveys and data collection proves to be very costly and difficult
Although there have been efforts into surveying the indicators of the MDGs as a pilot project in five kabupaten in two provinces three kabupaten (Bantaeng, Takalar, and Bone) in South Sulawesi Province and the other two kabupaten (Polman and Mamuju) in West Sulawesi Province in 2007, but most regional governments are somewhat reluctant to do such expensive survey and data collection
The MDGs are not just about measurement, but more about taking actions (Stalker, 2008)
The essential aim is not to count how many people live below the poverty line, but to find ways to make them have a decent life
With reliable data at the regional level, a review of what the regional governments have done and have not done for their people's welfare can be made
4.1.1 Objective of Knowing the Attainment of the MDGs through CBMS Data
The main objective of knowing the attainment of the MDGs through the CBMS in Kota Pekalongan is not to make an assessment of the MDG indicators
It is to show that some of the indicators can be generated from household surveys and that a review on the progress of the MDGs achievement in Kota Pekalongan can be completed, albeit several limitations
First, there have been difficulties concerning the unavailability of the 1990 Population Census (baseline) data
The available data could only present the recent figures showing the progress of the attainment of the MDGs in Kota Pekalongan but there was no baseline data as a comparison
Second, as previously mentioned, only some indicators can be generated by using the CBMS data
The data analysis, therefore, can be made only of the available indicators and left the rest for some future improvements
Third, since the data collected in the CBMS survey is at household level, there may have been missing values in the process so the attainment of the MDGs is lower than the published ratio
The following subchapters present some targets in four (out of eight) goals, i.e., goal 2 on achieving universal primary education, goal 3 on promoting gender equality and empowering women, goal 4 on reducing child mortality, and goal 5 on improving maternal health
It should be noted that the indicators in two Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur and Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan are based on the 2008 census data while those in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat and Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara are based on the 2009 data
4.1.2 Goal 2 Achieve Universal Primary Education Target 2.A
Ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling
a) Indicators In Indonesia, the indicators for this target are
(1) Primary school net enrollment ratio (age 7-12); (2) Junior high school net enrollment ratio (age 13-15); (3) Literacy rate of the 15-24 age group
b) Situation Table 3 shows the net enrollment ratio (NER), for both primary school and junior high school in Kota Pekalongan
The NER in all the four kecamatan is more than 95% for primary school meaning that more than 95% of the children aged 7-12 are attending school
Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur has the highest NER for junior high school (82.54%) while Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara has the lowest ratio
The third indicator is the literacy rate of population aged 15-24 (Table 4)
For this indicator, all the kecamatan in Kota Pekalongan show impressive figures, each more than 98%
The percentage of literate population aged 15-24 in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur in 2008 even reached almost 100 percent
4.1.3 Goal 3 Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women Target 3.A
Eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education, preferably by 2005, and in all levels of education no later than 2015
a) The progress is monitored using the following indicators
(1) the proportion of girls to boys in primary and secondary education, which is measured using the net enrollment ratio (NER) of girls to boys; (2) the literacy rates of women and men (aged 15-24), which is measured using the literacy gender parity index; (3) the share of women in wage employment in the nonagricultural sector; (4) the proportion of seats in the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) occupied by women
b) Situation To reach the goal of promoting gender equality and empowering women, the NER of girls to boys in primary education as well as the literacy rates of women and men aged 15-24 are taken into account
Unfortunately, indicators (3) and (4) cannot be generated from the CBMS data
As shown in Table 5, in 2008 the NER of girls to boys in primary education (age 7-12) in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur and Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan stand at 100.11% and 100.95% respectively
The 2009 census in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara presented a quite similar figure, the proportion exceeding 100%
The figure in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat, however, is below 100%, the lowest proportion among the four
On the other hand, the net enrollment ratio of girls to boys in junior high schools (age 13-15) in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur is below 100% while in the other three kecamatan, the proportion shows remarkable figures, exceeding 100%
The second indicator in Kota Pekalongan also shows impressive achievement
The literacy gender parity index in three of the four kecamatan exceeds 100%
The only one in which the index is slightly below 100% is Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat
The three indicators show that gender equality in education and literacy in Kota Pekalongan has already been promoted according to the targets set in the MDGs
Compared with those at the national level, the indicators in the city show better results
4.1.4 Goal 4
Reduce Child Mortality Target 4.A
Reduce by two-thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-five mortality rate
a) Indicators
The indicators used to evaluate the target of reducing by two-thirds the mortality rate of under-five children between 1990 and 2015 are
(1) infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births; (2) under-five mortality rate per 1,000 live births; (3) percentage of one-year-old children immunized against measles; and (4) percentage of children aged between 12 and 23 months immunized against measles
b) Situation
The main indicators for the fourth goal are mortality rates of both infants (under-one-yearolds) and under-fives
However, it was very difficult to generate the indicators
Even during the pilot survey specifically conducted for this purpose
For that reason, the CBMS data cannot provide the mortality rates of infants and under-fives
There still needs to be tremendous efforts to ensure that the target is reached
The third and fourth indicators are the percentages of one-year old children and children aged between 12 and 23 months immunized against measles
It should be noted that the data cover only the youngest child in the recorded households
The percentage of one-year old children immunized against measles in Kota Pekalongan is quite discouraging
The highest percentage for this indicator is 26.58% in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur, followed by 25.17% in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara, 22.84% in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan, and 22.08% in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat
The percentage of children aged 12-23 months immunized against measles is rather encouraging, reaching more than 50% in each of the four kecamatan
The percentage in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur even exceeds 75%, while in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat, Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara, and Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan, the figures stand at 69.54%, 67.32%, and 59.31% respectively
4.1.5 Goal 5
Improve Maternal Health Target 5.A
Reduce by three-quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio
a) Indicators
The following indicators are used to measure the reduction in the maternal mortality rate by three-quarters during 1990-2015
(1) maternal mortality rate per 100,000 live births; (2) the proportion of births assisted by trained birth attendants (%)
b) Situation
The lack of data for health indicators has made it impossible to carry out the analysis of the efforts to improve access to reproductive healthcare
The main indicator, i.e., the Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR), is not available for Kota Pekalongan for the same reasons behind the unavailability of previous indicators
For the second indicator, the data needed was of the percentage of last births assisted by skilled health professionals
Which in fact shows remarkable figures in the four kecamatan, i.e., 93.78% for Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur, 86.59% for Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan, 94.49% for Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat, and 89.72% for Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara
Target 5.B
Achieve, by 2015, universal access to reproductive health
a) Indicator
The proportion of married women between the ages of 15 and 49 using contraceptives, any methods (%)
b) Situation
The contraceptive rate of married women aged 15-49 for Kota Pekalongan, can be obtained using the CBMS data
The 2008 census in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur and Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan shows that 51.55% and 44.75% married women aged 15-49 use contraceptives
While the percentages for Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat and Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara from the 2009 Census are 52.55% and 55.96% respectively
These numbers give an idea that the government should give more attention to the reproductive health development
Otherwise, there will be demographic problems in the future
4.2 Descriptive Analysis
Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur and Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan In general, poverty is defined as the condition of limited capability to properly fulfill one's basic needs
The limitations come in various forms, such as the limitations of income, skills, health conditions, mastery of economic assets, and access to information
Being multidimensional, in addition to being measured using the monetary approach, poverty can also be measured by other aspects, such as access to education, health, basic infrastructures, and public information facilities, valuable goods ownership, opportunities to participate in public activities; and ability to express one's political views
The survey in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur and Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan covered 111,008 residents from 28,189 families across both kecamatan
There are 13 kelurahan in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur and 11 kelurahan Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan
There are 15,476 families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur, with an average family size of 3.8 people
The percentage of male residents is 50.38%, while 17.09% of the families in the area are headed by a female, usually widows and divorcees
The number of families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan is 12,713
The average family size is 4 people per family
The percentage of male residents is 50.47% and 15% of families are female-headed
Table 11 shows the percentage of the cross tabulation of the age groups and marital status categories of household heads on the total number of families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur and Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan
There are three age categories and less than 2 percent of the household heads in both kecamatan are under 25 years old and most of them are married
Household heads who are under 25 years old and single are adults living separately from their main family to pursue their study or career in either the same or a different kecamatan in Kota Pekalongan
Divorced household heads are those who are legally divorced or have been left by their spouse
The percentages of household heads in terms of marital status and age in both kecamatan are relatively the same
Almost 90 percent of the household heads, female or male, are of productive ages
The researchers divided the educational attainment of household heads into five categories based on the categories from the Statistics Indonesia
This allows researchers to compare the education attainment of the household heads in Kota Pekalongan with that of the residents aged 10 or older at the national level
The 2007 educational attainment data from the Statistics Indonesia shows that 7.57% of Indonesians aged 10 or older never attended school, 20.37% did not finish primary school, 31.19% finished primary school, 17.49% finished junior high school, and 23.37% finished senior high school
The number of household heads that did not finish primary education and other education levels is lower than that at the national level
The percentage of household heads that finished high school is higher than those who never attended or did not finish primary school
This indicates that household heads in Kota Pekalongan are relatively well-educated
The education level of household heads influences their plans to send their children at least to the same level of education as their own
The education level of household heads, therefore, is an indicator that can be used to analyze how high their children's education level may be or what their economic status will be
The job sector of the head of the family can also affect the family's welfare
Based on the 2007 data from the Kota Pekalongan Statistics Indonesia, more than 50 percent of the population works in the industrial sector
The CBMS census, however, shows that about 40 percent of the family heads in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur and Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan work in the services sector
This percentage is higher than that of the family heads who work in the industrial sector
The difference in the results owes to the fact that several sectors, such as transportation and financial sectors, were included in the services sector
Another probability is that SMERU simplified the categorization of the family heads' occupations into these sectors
There are a lot of family heads working as entrepreneurs or private workers who are categorized as working in the services sector
Through a discussion with some local officials and NGOs in Kota Pekalongan, SMERU learned that the industrial sector mostly depends on their commodities, i.e., batik, garment, and handicrafts
The handicrafts are mostly made from bamboo and this type of commodity is also exported
The data shows that, out of 24.5% of family heads working in the industrial sector in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur, around 10% of them are involved in the batik industry
In Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan, around 30% of the family heads are involved in the batik industry, from the 34.20% who work in the industrial sector
Tukang colet is the person who colors in the motives in a batik cloth; tukang mbabar is the person who is fully involved in the process of making the batik from a white sheet into batiste; tukang ngerombe is a person who weaves the edges of a batiste into a neat looking, well made garment
The next tables present information on families' behaviors and conditions in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur and Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan
Data on food consumption patterns obtained from the CBMS census in Kota Pekalongan provide information on the number of meals a family usually has in a day and their consumption of meat, eggs, and fish per week
Researchers also added a question about family's milk consumption
The milk consumption data provides information on how many times any family member, with the exception of infants, drinks any kind of milk in one week
Most families in both kecamatan have at least three meals each day
Although the percentage of people in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur who eat three times daily is lower than that in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan, their meat consumption is high 51.48% of families consuming meat at least once a week
Overall, since there are more families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur than in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan, the consumption of meat, eggs, fish, and milk of families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur is relatively higher
The next section provides information about poverty reduction programs from the government
The programs, received by families in both kecamatan, include those from the central government and programs from the local government, namely Raskin (Rice for Poor Households), BLT (Direct Cash Transfer), and several environment quality improvement programs.
Raskin is a large-scale social protection program, so the number of families receiving raskin is bigger than the number of those who receive other programs
In both kecamatan, Raskin recipients make up more than 50 percent of the population
This high percentage is the result of inaccurate program targeting
The raskin distributors or village officials included both the poor and the nonpoor as the program beneficiaries to prevent public conflict or to gain some political interest
The actual amount of raskin received by the beneficiaries is less than the amount of rice they should have (Hastuti et al 2008 23)
The numbers of families who received BLT in 2005 and 2008 were relatively the same
However, if cross tabulation is constructed between the 2005 and 2008 recipients, we can see that 267 families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur and 161 families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan received the allowance in 2005 but did not receive it in 2008
In regard to sanitation problems, the Kota Pekalongan Government carried out a number of programs to improve the quality of the environment, namely the P2KSBM (Community-based Family Welfare Acceleration Program), the Program for Settlement and Environment Improvement, and the Program for the Improvement of Housing Complex and Settlement
The motto used in the handling of sanitation problems was Free from Slums (Sanitation Development Technical Team, 2010)
Plastering of house walls and providing houses with toilets and wells are part of the Program for the Improvement of Settlement and Environment while roofing is part of the Program for the Improvement of Housing Complex and Settlement
Those programs are basically conducted by the local government to reduce the number of houses unfit to live in
Such houses have no bathroom/toilet and no clean water source, have dirt floor, and are poorly ventilated
The Kota Pekalongan Government's commitment to improve housing facilities requires clean rivers
Unfortunately, rivers in the city are in poor conditions owing to the batik industry that somewhat contributes to environmental degradation
Basic information about housing conditions is needed in getting the description of the economic condition of each household
Even though the number of families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur is bigger than that in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan, the percentage of families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur living in their own house is smaller
This, however, does not mean that people in that kecamatan are less wealthy than those in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan
If we compare the number of families in the two kecamatan who stated that their houses are inheritance that has not yet been divided, we can see that the number of families who live in their own homes in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur is bigger
In traditional Javanese culture, married couples tend to stay in their parent's house instead of moving to their own house so that they can take care of their parents or so that their parents can help take care of their children, especially if both husband and wife work
Table 16 shows that almost 50 percent of the families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur and Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan have already used marble, ceramic, or terrazzo materials for their house floor
The numbers of families whose house is tiled- or dirt-floored in both kecamatan are relatively similar, lower than the number of families whose house floor is made from marble, ceramic, or terrazzo materials
The fact that 22.95% houses are still dirt-floored and 18.74% are tiled-floor in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan and 20.97% houses dirt-floored and 22.73% tile-floored in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur should heighten the government's awareness of the existence of houses unfit to live in
The houses can be the targets of the Program for the Improvement of Housing Complex and Settlement
The percentage of families who have a toilet in their house is 77.16% in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur and 87.12% in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan (see Table 17)
Another sanitation program conducted by the Kota Pekalongan Government is the provision of public toilets, also known as MCK
Table 17 shows that the provision of MCK is among the community's essential needs
This can be seen mainly from the percentage of families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur that use public toilets which is higher than that in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan
The percentage of families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur that have their own toilet is smaller than that in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan
Moreover, approximately 6 percent of the families in both kecamatan still relieve themselves in the river
Discussions with the enumerators revealed that most people living near rice fields also consider the rice field's drainage systems as small rivers
Families who do not have their own toilet use the toilet of their neighbor, who may be a member of their extended families, since extended families tend to live close to one another
Unprotected wells are still the primary sources of drinking water for 41.46% of the families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur and 63.05% of families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan
Except for packaged drinking water or drinking water in refilled bottle, water from all other sources must be boiled before use
Although provision of public wells is part of the Kota Pekalongan Government's sanitation program, the number of these facilities, especially protected public wells, has not been able to cover the needs of more than 1 percent of the population in each kecamatan
Based on observations, most of the rivers across Kota Pekalongan are polluted with liquid waste from batik industries; this can be seen from the murkiness of the water
The researchers assumed that about 0.1% of families in both kecamatan use the river water from the rice fields' drainage systems or rainwater that they collected
Most families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur and Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan use the electricity distributed by the PLN (state-owned electricity company) as their primary source of lighting
The main concern in dealing with the availability of electricity is no longer about the source but the type of connection used to access the source
In Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur, 84.01% of the families that use the national electricity service are legally connected to the direct electricity source and 14.34% of families are getting electricity from another house
The number of families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan that is legally connected to the electricity source is 82.52% while 15.54% of families get electricity from another house
The researchers assume that the families getting electricity from another house did it legally, in the sense that the owners of the other house know that their electricity is being used by their neighbor and thus receive payment for this
Table 20 shows that 72.43% of the families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur and 65.54% in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan still use kerosene for cooking
Surprisingly, the number of families who use firewood in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan is higher than the number of families who use LPG
Those families are the target of the kerosene-to-gas conversion program from the central government
The Kota Pekalongan Government should try to find the reasons why the people prefer to use firewood
Is it because of the problems with regard to the availability of LPG tanks, the high price of LPG, or by their misunderstanding about LPG, which makes them afraid of using it
The city's infrastructure affects people's economic and health situation
The Kota Pekalongan Government seeks to maintain and improve the availability of basic infrastructures such as roads and sanitation services
Table 21 shows the types of road materials used for the construction of roads near the respondents' houses
The same table also shows that more than 50 percent of the families live in areas with good infrastructure
The percentage of roads constructed of dirt or sand is higher in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan than in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur
But those kinds of roads are found in every area in both kecamatan
For that reason, there are no specific locations that could be categorized as being disadvanteged
To ensure that the road infrastructure is in good condition, the Kota Pekalongan Government must know if there are water drains and waste canals at the area
In Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur, the percentage of families whose house is located along an asphalt road and is not equipped with water drains or waste canals is 2.52% while in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan it is 6.62%
If not carefully handled, the liquid waste could gradually erode or damage the road; this, eventually, will affect the public budget
As a region committed to its sanitation program, the government must pay attention to the city's waste disposal system
Table 22 shows that the public budget for waste disposal (directly collected by the local government workers) covers only 14.43% of the families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur and 13.39% in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan
The percentage of families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur (35.18%) who are willing to pay a worker to collect their garbage is 26.17% higher than that in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan (9.01%)
The neighborhood worker collects the garbage and takes it to the temporary waste disposal site
After that, the local government workers will take the garbage to the terminal waste disposal site in Kabupaten Pekalongan
Families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan choose to burn their garbage although this action may reduce the air quality in that kecamatan and eventually jeopardize their own health
They should be warned about the hazardous effect and the importance of keeping their health and the health of surrounding environment
Local government intervention is needed if such actions happen be caused by the people's limited economic ability, which prevents them from having access to a better environment
Financial characteristics in Kota Pekalongan were viewed from four aspects to see how families fulfill their financial needs
In both kecamatan, the share of families who access the formal financial institution, i.e., banks, is higher than the share of families who access the informal financial institution or personal financial source
We assume that a family accesses the formal institution if they need to finance their own business or buy valuable assets, such as land, a house, a car, etc
Families access the informal institution, by borrowing from their neighbors, to fulfill their basic needs if they do not have enough money
The percentage of families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur have savings is 19.02% while in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan the percentage is 20.48%
Finally, the percentage of families that have forced to sell their assets to pay debts is 8.59% in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur and 10.69% in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan, which are relatively small numbers
More than 60 percent of the families in both kecamatan use their own money to access health facilities
The number of families who have a health insurance or have their health expenses reimbursed by employers is small
This can be explained by the fact that most of the family heads are labors
With regard to the households in both kecamatan that are beneficiaries of Jamkesmas (public health insurance) program, the percentage in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur is bigger than that in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan, 23.88% and 16.07% respectively
4.3 Descriptive Analysis
Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat and Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara The CBMS survey is continued in 2009 for Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat and Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara
The survey in 2009 covered 158,697 residents from 41,651 families in both kecamatan
Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat consists of 13 kelurahan while Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara has 10 kelurahan
Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara had expanded their number of kelurahan from 9 to 10 kelurahan, with the new kelurahan is Panjang Baru
There are 22,095 families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat, with an average family size of 3.8 people
About 15.19% of the families are headed by females
The number of families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara is 19,556
The average family size is 3.77 people per family
The percentage of families headed by female is slightly higher there (15.24%) than that in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat
Based on their age, the family heads in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat and Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur are put into three categories
Around 75 percent of the family heads are 25-65 years old, productive age, and married
The ages of all the family heads range widely between 18 and 104
If we take into account the number of families in each kecamatan, we see that the proportion of family heads who are under 25 years old and married is relatively higher in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara than in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat
The characteristics of both kecamatan's locations are very much connected with the education level and job sector of the family heads in both areas
There are more family heads who finished senior high school and work in the service sector in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat
Most local universities and academies are located in that kecamatan
Moreover, most regional government's officials who are at least senior high school graduates also live in that kecamatan
Tables 27 and 28 present clearer depictions
This paragraph (refer to Table 12) compares the data of the family heads' educational attainment collected in this study and the national data from the Statistics Indonesia
The data from Statistics Indonesia on the educational attainment of Indonesians aged ten and above in 2009 show that 6.7% of those people never attended school, 21.58% did not finish primary school, 29.16% finished primary school, 17.55% finished junior high school, and 25.01% finished senior high school and higher education level
Table 27 reveals that the percentage of family heads in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat and Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara who never attended school and did not finish primary school is lower than the percentage of family heads with the same educational attainment at the national level
On the other hand, the percentage of family heads who finished primary school and senior high school is higher than that at the national level
This has shown that there has been an increase in the awareness of getting higher education among the people of Kota Pekalongan
Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara is located in the northern part of Kota Pekalongan, confined by the Java Sea at its north
Owing to its location, the kecamatan is known for its fishery, which consists of production in pond fishery and fish-as-food manufacturing such as fish salting, boiling, and smoking
Table 28 shows that 8.51% of the family heads in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara work in farming sector, including fishery
It is higher than the percentage of family heads working in the same sector in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat and two other kecamatan (see Table 13)
There are also several factories, such as garment factories, in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara
Industrial sector employs 26.29% of the family heads in this kecamatan
Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat, on the other hand, is the center of Kota Pekalongan administration; the office of the head of kota, the local House of Representatives, and other local government offices are located in this kecamatan
The service sector employs 47.10% of the kecamatan's family heads
Table 29 gives information on the families' consumption pattern in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat and Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara
The table shows the daily meal frequency in families and their weekly consumption of meat, fish, eggs, and milk
In general, families in both kecamatan show normal consumption patterns
Almost every family has at least three meals a day
The level of regular fish consumption is relatively high for families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara since this kecamatan is located in a coastal area
Consumption of fish, compared to that of meat, is relatively high in both kecamatan
Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat and Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara receive various programs on poverty reduction from both the central government and the Kota Pekalongan Government
An example of program from the kota government is the Program for the Improvement of Settlement and Environment that includes plastering of house walls, provision of toilets and wells, and house renovation
Based on the location characteristics, residents in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara are more vulnerable since most of them are fishers and labors in garment or fishery industry
Consequently, there are more beneficiaries of Raskin, Jamkesmas, and BLT in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara than in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat
The coverage level of well provision in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara is 1.63% or 0.68% lower than that in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat
The program faces problems at coastal areas, such as seawater 
Intrusion become a big problem for the community in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara, especially in Kelurahan Bandengan, Kelurahan Panjang Baru, Kelurahan Krapyak Lor, and Kelurahan Degayu
The severity of the problem has made well provision program a less-than-good choice to provide better sanitation facilities for people in coastal areas
More than 50 percent of the families in both kecamatan have their own house
However, the percentage of families living with another family is relatively high for Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara
Most of them are young couples
This is verified by Table 26, which shows that Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara has a higher number of families whose head is below 25 years old (1.72%) than Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat (1.17%)
Since Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat is the center of the regional government administration, the settlements in and around this area is relatively organized and well-structured, typical of housing complex
On the other hand, settlements in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara are densely populated and not well-structured, typical of village housing areas
The percentage of families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat living in houses with marble or ceramic floor is 53.28%, higher than the percentage of families living in wood-floored houses (0.08%) or bamboofloored houses (0.04%)
The percentage of families who have a toilet in their house is 84.61% in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat and 69.79% in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara
Since it is hard for families in coastal areas to get ground water of good quality, those who live in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara somewhat depend on the provision of public toilets
No access to public toilets has caused 12.71% of the families there to use rivers, water canals or rice field's drainage systems for toilet
The unavailability of good ground water source in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara is compensated by the provision of PDAM/tap water
The percentage of families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara used this service is 54.06%, significantly higher than that in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat
Some of these families, however, are not customers of PDAM services
They get the PDAM water from their neighbor or another family who lives next to them or buy clean water from a water seller in their neighborhood
About 30 percent of the families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat get water from a protected well/well with jet pump, which means that they can still depend on the availability of ground water source
Most families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat and Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara use the electricity distributed by the PLN as their primary source of lighting, with percentage being 95.96% of families and 95.42% of families respectively
In Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat, 80.02 % of families that use the national electricity services are self-connected and 15.73% of families are accessing it from another house
The number of families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara that use a self-connection to access the national electricity services is 78.08%, while 17.20% of families access electricity from another house
About 50% of families in both kecamatan who are subscriber of national electricity services and selfconnected utilize the 450 watt voltage in their daily usage
Errors made during the data entry process (see subchapter 3.4 Data Cleaning Process) caused the information on fuels used by households in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat and Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara to contain 22 percent missing values of the total households in both kecamatan
Table 35, however, shows that more than half of the households in both kecamatan still use kerosene
The situation is not much different from that in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur and Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan
In May 2009, the Kota Pekalongan Government carried out the kerosene-to-gas conversion program
This program distributed gas stoves and three kilogram gas tanks to the citizens
When the 2009 CBMS data collection was conducted at the beginning of August 2009, we found that only a small number of the community members who used the LPG because they were worried by the news from various parts of the country about explosions of gas tanks distributed by the government
Based on the infrastructure conditions in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat and Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur, the percentage of asphalt as type of road material in each family housing area is 48.45% in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat and 49.05% in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara
To maintain the quality of asphalt roads in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara is problematic since the sea water attrition is quite severe
The percentage of families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat who are willing to pay a worker to collect their garbage is 36.72%, while in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara is 35.96%
There are quite a lot families who still burnt their garbage instead of choosing other waste disposal method
Unexpectedly, the number is high for families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat (35.24%)
The percentage of families who drop their garbage at public place and into water canals/river is relatively high in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara, which is about 2.68% and 6.99% respectively
The study conducted by the Center for Policy and Implementation Studies (CPIS) in 1992 recommended a waste disposal problem solution that can be adopted by the Kota Pekalongan Government
The solution is to run a business model consisting of two kinds of activities to deal with the households' wastes and market's wastes at the same time by recycling the producing compost from the wastes (CPIS, 1992)
Recycling unused products can give benefits by turning them into valuable things and selling them
Producing compost which is part of biological process can also give benefits
It can create employment, save some spaces at the terminal disposal site, save some of the budget for waste disposal, increase environment health, decrease environment pollution, ad help preserve natural resources
The different data format (see subchapter 3.4 Data Cleaning Process) caused a significant gap between the data of families' access to informal financial institution or personal financial resources in the kecamatan visited in 2008 and in kecamatan visited in 2009
The data for 2008 shows that 1% of the families access informal financial institutions or personal financial resources while in 2009 there were 10% of the total families
The percentage of families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat who keep their money in formal institutions, such as bank, people's creadit bank (BPR), cooperatives, or microcredit organization, is 5.46% higher than that in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara
The percentages of families who had to sell assets to pay off debt in both kecamatan are quite similar
Table 39 shows the financial sources of families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat and Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara to access health facilities
It shows us that a significant number of families still use their own money as the main financial source to access health facilities
There are 73.05% families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat and 66.12% families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara who use their own money when facing health problems
The number of families who use Jamkesmas is relatively high in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara, about 20.80%
4.4 Result of Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
In measuring household welfare, ideally, we use the income, consumption, or expenditure data of each household
However, collecting such data, especially in big volume, is difficult in terms of time and money
Another problem is related to the reliability of the data
Households could give false information regarding their expenditure or income during interviews
By using the PCA method, each household's welfare is predicted based on the information about asset ownership such as the ownership of a house, the house condition, ownership of a vehicle, etc
This is an alternative to recording details of consumption expenditure
The PCA method also allows researchers to determine local-specific welfare indicators
This report provides information about welfare rank of each kecamatan in Kota Pekalongan
However, the available data used in this analysis is less than it should be because of several missing values or unavailable data
The PCA in STATA only calculates households/ questionnaires with no missing values
Through the PCA, it was possible to rank ten highest welfare indicators which are relevant in explaining the welfare rank of a family
The negative score of a variable indicates that the variable is more likely to reduce a family's welfare ranking while a positive score indicates that a variable boosts the rank of a family
4.4.1 PCA Result
Poverty Profile of Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur
Table 40 lists 17 indicators that have the highest coefficients from the 64 welfare indicators in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur
Nine of the 17 indicators listed in the table are related to asset ownership
This shows that the ownership of assets, especially ownership of electronics and motorized vehicles, acts as the best welfare differentiator between families
There is only one indicator from the variables involving the sector in which the household head works family head working in the industrial sector, especially the batik industry
Although the industrial sector has generated the most employment in Kota Pekalongan, the trend is negative
This means that people who work in the industrial sector are more likely to be poor
Another interesting finding is related to the ownership of a gas stove
More than 50 percent of the families in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur still use kerosene as their cooking fuel
The same thing can be found in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan (see Table 42)
Table 41 provides the characteristics of the 10% richest and 10% poorest families to prove that there are indeed significant differences between them
No family among the 10% of the poorest group has a refrigerator, gas stove, or computer
In contrast, most of the rich families own the three items
Only a small percentage of the poor have phone connection, mobile phone, motorcycle, or fan
The percentage of family heads from poorest families working in the industrial sector is 65.09% while for household heads from the richest families the percentage is 2.54%
In terms of education, 65.70% of the household heads from the poorest families finished primary school
The percentages of those families having higher levels of education show decreasing trend and eventually zero down at the diploma and university degree level
The gap between the richest and the poorest is even wider for the education level of husband and wife
For the richest families, almost 50 percent of the family heads and their spouse are senior high school graduates; while for the poorest families, most of the family heads and their spouse are primary school graduates
About 84.14% of the family heads from the richest families work in the services sector while 38.65% of the spouses also work
On the other hand, more than 50 percent of the family heads from the poorest families work in the industrial sector most of them labors
In the poorest families, a slightly higher percentage of the spouses, 41.84%, work
In terms of food consumption patterns, the poorest families are more likely to have fewer than three meals a day
The percentage of the poorest families that consume egg at least once a week is 38.68% while 9.74% of them consume meat once a week, 45.09% consume fish once a week, and only 14.39% drink milk at least once a week
There is no significant difference between the use of modern healthcare facilities by the richest and the poorest families
The same pattern occurs in infant mortality in families for the past three years
The percentage of the richest families using private toilet and protected drinking water sources 99.74% and 90.88% respectively, considerably higher than the percentage of the poorest families for the same indicators, 33.60% and 24.65% respectively
However, 1.40% of the richest families still live in a dirt-floored house
Viewed from the perspective of access to formal financial institutions, 67.05% of the richest families have savings while only 1.05% of the poorest families do
In the past three years, 11.83% of the richest families were indebted to formal financial institutions, but not to informal institutions or from individuals
The percentage of families who had to sell their assets to pay off debts is higher for the poorest families, who most likely borrowed money to fulfill their basic needs in the first place
An electricity supply is accessible for people in the city, so both the rich and the poor have access to electricity
While most of the rich families have access to newspapers and magazines, since they can afford it, only 1.84% of poor families can access these sources of information
4.4.2 PCA Result
Poverty Profile of Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan
Of the 17 welfare indicators listed in Table 42, the most positive variable is the ownership of refrigerator and the most negative is if the household head working in the industrial sector
Welfare indicators in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan are mostly the same as those in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur
Two welfare indicators with the highest coefficient that distinguish the two kecamatan is the ownership of color TV and radio
The trend of the working sector of the household heads is also negative, although the coefficient of the variable in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan is relatively small compared to that in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur
Welfare indicators such as ownership of a refrigerator and gas stove were ranked first and second
Based on the welfare scores of each family, we are able to isolate the 10% richest and 10% poorest families
Table 43 provides the characteristics of the 10% richest families compared to those of the 10% poorest families based on the 64 welfare indicators
The poor families do not have refrigerators, gas stoves, computers, air conditioners, or cars as their assets
It is also less likely for them to have cellular phones, DVD players, electric fans, or motorcycles
In regard to the job sector of the family heads and their spouse, the pattern in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan is no different from that in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur
The percentage of family heads from poor families who work in the industrial sector is 67.66%, while 63.49% of the rich families work in the services sector
The percentage of spouses who work is relatively the same for poor and rich families, at 43.63% and 48% respectively
More family heads of the rich families graduated from senior high school in comparison with those of the poor families
About 69,40% of the family heads from the poor families are primary school graduates
The highest percentage for spouses' education level of the poor families is 66.12% (primary school graduates)
From the perspective of food consumption, 98.26% of the richest families and 92.81% of the poorest of families eat three times a day
The percentage of families consuming egg at least once a week is 93.74% for the richest families and 33.57% for the poorest families
There are no significant differences between the poor and the rich in terms of the use of modern medical treatment
However, the percentage of families that experienced the death of an infant in the past three years is higher for the rich families, and there are still 0.29% of the richest families who live in a dirt-floored house
The percentage of the richest families who have their own toilet is 99.69% while that of the poorest families is 59.55%
In general, the percentage of the use of private toilet is higher in Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan than in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur, for both the richest and the poorest families
The percentage of rich families who drink water from a protected source is 74.26%, while for poor families this percentage is 16.63%
The percentage of rich families who have savings is 68.82%, while that of the poor families is only 1.03%
There is a significant difference in credit access from formal or informal financial institutions between the rich and poor families
The percentage of rich families who borrows from formal financial institutions is 25.03% higher than those who borrow from informal financial institutions
The percentage of poor families who borrow from formal institutions is 24.64% and 0.82% of them borrow from informal financial institutions
The percentage of richest families who were able to buy new clothes in the past year is 99.69% and for the poorest families the percentage is 84.60%, which is quite high
The percentage of rich families who are actively involved in neighborhood organizations, including as RT or RW officials, or as members of karang taruna (local neighborhood youth association), is 47.69%
On the other hand, the percentage of poor families who are active in the neighborhood organizations is only 9.75%
This is most likely because the poor families probably use most of their time to work and fulfill their basic needs
The percentage of rich families who access information from newspapers or magazines is significantly higher than that of poor families
In regard to crime rate, the same pattern occurs
The percentage of rich families who were victims of crime is also higher than that of poor families
THIs is because of the fact that rich families have more assets
4.4.3 PCA Result
Poverty Profile of Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat
Table 44 shows that families whose head works in the industrial sector are more likely to be poor
On the other hand, ownership of refrigerator and gas stove would indicate higher probability that a family is rich
Accessing information from newspapers or magazines also contributes to a family's welfare rank
Families who have access to information, subscribe to a newspaper or magazine, or have a tendency to read newspapers and magazines are categorized as relatively wealthy family
Based on the welfare scores of each family, we are able to isolate the 10% richest and 10% poorest families
Table 45 provides the characteristics of the 10% richest families compared to 10% poorest families based on the 64 welfare indicators
In terms of education, 67.66% of the family heads from poor families finished primary school; the same thing occurs for the spouse in poor families (64.75%)
The percentage of poor families who have high education background is lower than that of rich families
The family heads from the richest families has a higher percentage for graduated from university, which is about 43.54% while their spouse mostly graduated from senior high school
The percentage of family heads from poor families who work in the industrial sector is 68.20%, while 90.12% of the rich families work in the services sector
The percentage of working spouses from the richest and poorest families has slight differences, which is about 10%
In terms of food consumption patterns, the poorest families are more likely to have less consumption of meat in a week
The percentage of the richest families who consume meat once a week is 92.54%, while the poorest families only 8.86%
Both groups, however, have relatively similar pattern to eat three times a day with percentage level being more than 80%
The gap between the rich and poor is quite wide for the ownership of air-conditioning device, car, refrigerator, gas stove, and computer which explains the ten highest ranked welfare indicators
However, the gap is not too significant in terms of bicycle ownership
Just like the case in Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur and Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan, there are no significant differences between the poor and the rich in terms of the use of modern medical treatment
The percentage of the richest who sought for modern medical treatment when sick is 89.69% and the poorest is 89.27%
Families using private toilets and drinking from protected water source is 40% higher in the richest families
Most of the rich families have access to newspaper and magazines, since they can afford to buy these or purchase a subscription, while only 2.37% of poorest families can access these sources of information
For families whose member active in neighborhood organization is more likely to occur in the richest families
It is probably their economic status that raises their social status and gives them an opportunity to involve in those activities, as well as the leisure time that they have
When looked at from the perspective of access to formal financial institutions, 76.53% of the richest families have savings, while only 0.55% of the poorest families have savings
In the past three years, 30.62% of rich families have received credit from formal institutions and 4.49% of them received credit from informal institutions or from individuals
4.4.4 PCA Result
Poverty Profile of Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara
The welfare indicators in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara (Table 46) are mostly the same as those in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat (Table 44)
The differences are only in the order of the rank of each indicator
Nine from the 17 indicators were still about asset ownership, which shows that assets ownership acts as the best differentiator of welfare between families
The first rank of welfare indicators, as in the analysis on Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat is of family heads that work in industrial sector and it has the same negative trend
The second and third ranks are also the same as those in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat
Two welfare indicators in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara that are different from the analysis on Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat are the use of private toilet (positive trend) and family heads working in agricultural sector (negative trend)
Table 47 provides the characteristics of the 10% richest and 10% poorest families and proves that there are indeed significant differences between them, in addition to the 17 highest ranked welfare indicators
The education level of family heads from the rich families is higher for those who graduated from senior high school, about 48.92%
For the poorest families the education level of family heads is higher for those who graduated from elementary school (66.34%)
Spouses' education in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara has the same pattern as that in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat
Spouses from the poorest families are generally graduates of primary school (64.19%) while those from the richest families are generally senior high school graduates (49.20%)
Many family heads from the richest families still engaged in the services sector (90.34%) while only 9.67% of the poorest families are in this sector
The family heads from the poorest families in this kecamatan mostly work in industrial sector (62.45%)
However, the composition of family heads from the poorest families who work in agricultural sector in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara (17.80%) is relatively higher than those in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat (2.79%)
See the comparison in Table 47 and Table 45
Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara is located in a coastal area so the number of family heads working in the agricultural sector as fishers and labors in fishery market is higher that of the poorest family heads in Kecamatan Pekalongan Barat
There are considerable contrasts between the richest and poorest families in terms of consumption pattern
Although just about every family eats three times a day, the protein intake is relatively different
More than 89% of rich families consume egg, meat, and fish at least once a week, while only 44.30%, 5.35%, and 62.38% of poor families regularly consume egg, meat and fish respectively
There are relatively large gaps in asset ownership between the richest and the poorest groups
There are two assets owned by the rich but not by the poor, which are computer and car
The asset that is generally owned by both the rich and the poor is bicycle
Based on the geographical area of Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara, we assume that with most of the residents being fishers, there will be significant percentage of boat or motor boat ownership
However, from informal discussions with enumerators in Kelurahan Panjang Baru, most family heads who work as fishers are just labor in a boat or ship owned by other people or company
As many as 92.49% of the richest families seeks modern health service during sickness while only 87.55% of the poorest families do so
There are 21.42% of the poorest families who still live in dirt-floored house and only 23.78% who have private toilet
The access to electricity source is high for both groups since national electricity source is widely available in the city
The percentage of richest families who were able to buy new clothes in the past year is 98.61% and for the poorest families the percentage is 68.98%
More than 70% of the richest families have access to newspapers or magazine, while around 1% of poor families have such access
In accordance with their asset ownership, rich families have greater access to formal financial institutions
Most rich families (69.77%) and a small number of the poor families (0.49%) have savings accounts
In the past three years, 31.97% of the richest families have received credit from formal and 6.05% from informal institutions or individuals
The percentage of poor families who have pawned their assets to pay debts is relatively high (13.21%)
V CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1 Conclusion
The CBMS data collection in Kota Pekalongan is aimed at getting information and/or accurate and comprehensive data on the social condition and welfare status of households in the area
There are a lot of valuable lessons that can be learned from the data collection
The lesson learnt include the process of selecting enumerators, the supervision of enumerators during data processing, and the process of entering the data
They all need to be taken into serious consideration so that the CBMS data collection can be done smoothly
The following are a number of lessons learned in the implementation of the CBMS in Kota Pekalongan
a) High turnover of government officials at the local level hinders smooth coordination among the institutions involved in this initiative
During the CBMS implementation, five different technical officers-in-charge from the local government were assigned one after the other
This has caused delays in the project schedule
b) Coordination among the involved institutions requires special efforts and attention, especially in terms of commitment, time devoted, and technical understanding of the CBMS itself
c) Enumerators who were already above 55 years old, primary school graduates, and government staff members had difficulties during the data enumeration
In addition, enumerators who did not attend the training but were involved in the data enumeration contributed in the inaccurate data processing
d) Training of enumerators requires longer time because of the varied education background and age of the enumerators
This somewhat affected their ability to comprehend the questionnaires
e) The entry of the data collected in 2008 (Kecamatan Pekalongan Selatan and Kecamatan Pekalongan Timur) was done by CV Waditra, a subcontractor of the local government in Information Technology and data processing
CV Waditra, however, used MySQL application, different from the one used by SMERU (STATA)
As a result, SMERU had to export these data into STATA
This process was time consuming
f) The data entry training, which was the responsibility of the Kota Pekalongan Government, was not fully effective because the number of data entry people far exceeded the number of computers available
Other training facilities such as projector were not available on the training day
g) The data entry was done in two separate places
This has made controlling over data entry a difficult task
Moreover, the number of data entry people far exceeded the number of computers available so they have to take turn using the computers
h) The questionnaires filled, were not by kelurahan
This has created a difficulty for SMERU to do data verification
From the analysis of the CBMS data, we can conclude that the level of educational attainment of the family heads is still low, the local government has to pay more attention to the primary net enrollment ratio, a substantial number of families still use unprotected well as the sources to get clean water, and some families still burn their garbage as a way of getting rid of it
5.2 Recommendation
Based on these lessons learned, researchers make the following recommendations
a) Recruitment of enumerators and data entry people must be done selectively
Accurate data are needed as the basis for planning and their presence can reduce the possibility of mismanagement of poverty reduction programs
For that reason, enumerators become an important factor in the data processing
An enumerator must be (i) local resident; (ii) literate; (iii) at least a junior high school graduate; (iv) experienced in data collecting; (v) 55 years old or younger; and (vi) female
The recruitment of enumerators is crucial and must be done very selectively
Education background of a prospective enumerator should be carefully considered as it can tell how well they can comprehend the questionnaires used
Enumerators' understanding of the questionnaires is critical so that they do not make mistakes when collecting data, which can affect data validity
During the data processing, especially at the beginning of the process, enumerators must be intensively attended and supervised
This can reduce or even eliminate errors at the subsequent data filling
Trainers and the kelurahan-level coordinators play significant roles at the beginning of data processing
In order to get accurate and valid data, trainings and data entry should not be separated from the overall data collection process
An appropriate data entry method is as important as a proper way of filling out the questionnaires so that accurate data can be obtained
The methodology that we chose could be used to identify the poor in every kelurahan
We have also indicated that, given enough support and supervision, locals were able to conduct their own poverty monitoring
b) The Kota Pekalongan Government should take effective measures to improve the low net enrollment ratio (NER)
The results of the CBMS data collection revealed that the NER in primary education and junior high school and the literacy rate in Kecamatan Pekalongan Utara are the lowest of all the kecamatan in Kota Pekalongan
Consequently, the kota government should socialize the nine-year compulsory education, work together with lembaga swadaya masyarakat in organizing Kejar Paket A and B, and provide trainings on business skills especially for people in areas where the NER is relatively low
c) The Kota Pekalongan Government should increase the capacity of family heads
More than 50 percent of the family heads in Kota Pekalongan are low-educated; they are mostly primary school graduates
The local government can help to improve their people's welfare by giving technical assistances in the form of business trainings for family heads so that their capacity can be increased
d) The Kota Pekalongan Government should improve their services with regard to the provision of clean water
Families in Kota Pekalongan get clean water from various sources, mostly from unprotected well
To cater to the needs of clean water, the local government can work together with the Ministry of Public Works to channel clean water through pipes to families who live in areas where clean water is not available
e) The Kota Pekalongan Government should build an integrated households' waste disposal system
Households dispose their wastes in various ways
Most of them burn their wastes and only a small number of them use the service of the garbage collecting facilities provided by the local government
This clearly affects the condition of the air and environment
An integrated waste disposal system will benefit both the local government and the people in the area
For example, every kecamatan can develop a waste recycling and compost production site built on a state-owned piece of land
To conclude, after studying the facts resulted from the CBMS implementation in Kota Pekalongan, we hope that all the stakeholders in other kabupaten/kota can be informed about this accurate monitoring system
Involving local community, designed specifically to adjust to local characteristics, objective, and applicable by kabupaten/kota administration, the system can certainly help local governments in their effort to increase public welfare in their territory more effectively
Impact of Supermarkets on Traditional Markets and Retailers in Indonesia's Urban Centers
ABSTRACT
This study measures the impact of supermarkets on traditional markets in urban centers in Indonesia quantitatively using difference-in-difference and econometric methods as well as qualitatively using in-depth interviews
The quantitative methods find no statistically significant impact on earnings and profit but a statistically significant impact of supermarkets on the number of employees in traditional markets
The qualitative findings suggest that the decline in traditional markets is mostly caused by internal problems from which supermarkets benefit
Therefore, ensuring the sustainability of traditional markets would require an overhaul of the traditional market management system, enabling them to compete with and survive alongside supermarkets
Key words
impact evaluation, traditional market, supermarket, urban, Indonesia
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Supermarkets have been around in major urban centers in Indonesia for the last three decades
At the onset of the liberalization of the retail sector in 1998, however, foreign supermarket operators began entering the country, sparking fierce competition with local operators
Some corners claim that traditional markets are the real victims of the intense competition as they lose their customers due to the cheap, high quality products and the more comfortable shopping environment that supermarkets provide
Therefore, there are calls to limit the construction of supermarkets, especially in locations near traditional markets
This study investigates the truth behind these claims by measuring the impact of supermarkets on traditional market traders in Indonesia's urban centers
Primarily quantitative research methods have been employed and qualitative research was conducted to reveal the stories behind the quantitative findings
The quantitative methods utilize the difference-in-difference (DiD) and econometric methods
The qualitative method consists of in-depth interviews with the Traditional Traders' Association (APPSI), Modern Retailers' Association (APRINDO), traditional market managers, traditional market traders, supermarket officials, and officials from relevant local government agencies
Five traditional markets were chosen as the treatment group, while two traditional markets were chosen as the control group
The sampling frame ensures that these markets are representative of traditional markets in urban areas in Indonesia
Furthermore, it also ensures that the treatment and control groups have relatively the same characteristics other than their proximity to supermarkets
Two treatment markets and one control market are located in Depok, an urban center near Jakarta, while the rest are located in the Greater Bandung area, the capital of West Java Province
Randomly selected traders in these markets were interviewed using a questionnaire
These traders are representative of the traditional markets
In addition, we conducted 37 in-depth interviews with the aforementioned stakeholders
In contrast to supermarkets, the majority of traditional markets are owned and operated by the local administration, usually under the Office of Market Management (Dinas Pasar)
A relatively small share of traditional markets, however, is developed through cooperation between the local administration and private companies, normally under a build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme
The private companies then pay the local administration a set contribution
A market manager appointed by the head of the Office of Market Management manages the markets owned by the local administration
In some cases, market managers are responsible for more than one market
The Office of Market Management sets an annual market services fees (retribusi) income target for each market it owns
The main duty of the market manager is to achieve this target
Failing to achieve the target often results in the immediate dismissal of the market manager
Therefore, more often than not, collecting retribusi from the traders becomes the sole occupation of a traditional market manager instead of properly managing the market
The main commodities sold in the traditional markets are fresh vegetables, sold by one fifth of traders, followed by other food and beverage ingredients
In contrast, only 7% of traders sell rice, the staple food of most Indonesians
Only one third of traders have households as their main customers
When asked who their main competitors are, 32.9% of traders identify other traders in the market, 27% identify supermarkets, 18% identify street vendors as their main rivals, and 13% declare that they have no competitors
In contrast to the high share of traders who are able to identify their competitors, there is a glaring lack of real strategy employed to beat the competition
Only 20% of traders have a quality assurance policy and another 13% provide discounts to loyal customers, while 38% rely only on politeness to customers and almost 10% have no strategy at all
In terms of supply chain, 40% of traders mainly use professional suppliers, while 30% get their goods from wholesale markets
Almost 90% pay their suppliers with cash
These conditions mean that traders in traditional markets fully bear the risk for loss of their merchandise
This contrasts with supermarkets, which mainly use consignment or credit methods
Regarding working capital, 87.6% of traders use their own capital, which indicates their lack of access or willingness to make use of commercial loans to finance their business
This could act as a major constraint for expanding their business
On average, traders in both treatment and control markets have experienced a decline in their business over the past three years
In the in-depth interviews, respondents revealed the main causes for this decline were the weakened purchasing power of their customers due to the fuel price increases, and the increased competition with street vendors who occupy the parking spaces and other areas surrounding the markets
According to the indepth interviews, the third cause of the decline in business for traditional market traders is supermarkets
This was especially found for traders in the treatment group
It should be noted, however, that supermarkets were identified as the primary cause of the decline in business by traders in Pamoyanan
In this study, the only market in the study where the majority of market customers are middle-class households, and which also does not have a problem with street vendors
The qualitative analysis finds that supermarkets indeed adversely impact the traditional retailers
Furthermore, it found evidence that traditional markets located near supermarkets are more adversely affected than those further away
However, this is largely due to the weak competitiveness of traditional retailers
The traders, market managers, and APPSI representatives all state that the main steps that should be taken to ensure their survival are improving the traditional market infrastructure, organizing the street vendors, and creating better market management practices
Most traders explicitly stated their confidence that supermarkets would not drive them out of business if the above conditions were met
The quantitative impact analysis finds mixed statistical results for various performance indicators of traditional markets, such as profits, earnings, and employee numbers
Out of these performance indicators, supermarkets only statistically impact traditional markets by the number of employees hired by the traditional traders
The data indicates that traditional traders are willing to hire more employees the further they are located from the supermarkets, and vice versa
Traditional traders are competing in an almost perfect competition and their strategies to maintain normal profits include adding to the amount and variety of products sold, and reducing expenses including the cost of hiring employees
While we indeed find evidence of traders that have gone out of business during the last three years, reasons for this are more complex than the entry of supermarkets alone
Most business closures are related to internal market and personal problems
In addition, traders who sell mainly to non-households and have maintained a good relationship with customers over a long period are more likely to stay in business
The results from the qualitative and quantitative analysis above are further confirmed by the success story of a traditional market located in the Bumi Serpong Damai residential area in Tangerang, which has retained its customers in spite of new supermarkets opening nearby
A real estate developer and the local government jointly manage the traditional market
It is generally clean, safe, and has ample parking spaces and sufficient amenities
This market has also successfully applied a single-story building design with high ceilings to provide adequate air circulation
This proves that a competitive traditional market is able to successfully compete with and exist near supermarkets
In order to ensure a thriving traditional market environment, policies that will help to increase the competitiveness of traditional markets must be created and implemented
Firstly, improve the infrastructure in the traditional markets
This includes ensuring proper hygiene and cleanliness levels, ample lighting, and an overall comfortable environment
For example, the current two-story market building design is not popular among traders because customers are unwilling to go to the upper floor
In order to do this, local governments and private traditional market managers must go beyond considering traditional markets only as a source of income
They must invest in the upgrade of traditional markets and set a minimum standard for services
This also entails appointing qualified people as market managers and giving them enough authority to make decisions, so they do not act solely as retribusi collectors
It is also important to enhance the performance of market managers either by providing training or by regular evaluation
Furthermore, the market manager should consistently coordinate with traders in order to achieve better market management
A joint venture between local government and the private sector such as that in the Bumi Serpong Damai area might also be a solution to increase the competitiveness of traditional market
Secondly, local governments should organize the street vendors, either by providing kiosks inside the traditional markets or by enforcing the law banning them from opening stalls around a traditional market
It is very important to prevent these vendors blocking the market entrance
The third recommendation pertains to the traders themselves
Most of them have to pay their suppliers with cash and use their own capital for the business
This poses a constraint for business expansion, and also means that the traders are burdened with all the risks associated with doing business
Given that it is not common practice to insure a business, the traders are vulnerable to even a small shock
Therefore, it is worth investigating the types of insurance suitable for traders, and assisting them should they need additional capital to finance expansion
Finally, the conditions uncovered in our study areas point to the need for the thorough regulation of modern markets, including such issues as the rights and responsibilities of the market operators and the local administration, and also sanctions for breaching the regulations
While some administrations may deem it necessary to have a separate bylaw, the improvement of the current bylaw should be sufficient
In addition, both levels of governments should act strictly in accordance with the regulations
Moreover, it is important to ensure that the regulations are understood by all stakeholders
National and regional governments must have control mechanisms and monitoring systems in place to ensure fair competition amongst traditional and modern retailers
I INTRODUCTION
Bitter competition in the retail industry has been present in developed countries for much of the past century, particularly in the United States and Western Europe
The competition exists mainly between traditional retailers and modern retailers, that is, supermarkets and hypermarkets
Towards the last decade of the millennium, however, the battleground has expanded to developing countries, where deregulations in the retail sector aimed at increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) have resulted in the proliferation of supermarket chains (Reardon & Hopkins 2006)
Reardon et al (2003) find that as of 2003, supermarkets' share of the retail food sector in scores of developing economies, such as South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Mexico, Poland, and Hungary, has reached 50%
In Brazil and Argentina, where the proliferation began earlier, the share was around 60%
Traill (2006) uses various assumptions and predicts that by 2015, supermarkets share of the retail food market will reach between 61% in Argentina, Mexico, and Poland; 67% in Hungary; and 76% in Brazil
In Indonesia, local supermarkets have been around since the 1970s, although they are still concentrated in large urban centers
Foreign-brand supermarkets began entering the market in late 1990s as FDI in the retail sector was opened in 1998
The increased competition has resulted in supermarkets reaching smaller cities in their efforts to find new consumers and wage price wars
Hence, while Indonesian supermarkets catered only to the upper class in the 1980s and early 1990s (CPIS 1994), their mushrooming in smaller cities and predatory pricing practices mean that consumers from the lower classes now have easy access to supermarkets
This is certainly also the case in other developing countries (Reardon et al 2003; Collett & Wallace 2006)
While the competition between supermarkets is theoretically beneficial to consumers, and perhaps to the economy as a whole, relatively little is known about the impact of supermarkets on traditional markets
Measuring the impact is especially crucial given that supermarkets are now directly competing with traditional markets, which used to cater to a different market segment
This study analyzes the impact of supermarkets on traditional markets and retailers in urban centers Indonesia
In this study we limit our respondents to traders in traditional markets as they make up the majority of traditional traders in Indonesia
Moreover, since goods normally sold by these traders are also available in the supermarkets and hypermarkets, they are the main competitors
Therefore, this study looks at the impact of supermarkets and hypermarkets on traders in traditional markets in Indonesia
Types of retailers in Indonesia are listed in Appendix I
In this report the word supermarket points to both supermarkets and hypermarkets wherever no distinction is specifically mentioned
The rest of the report is as follows
Section II provides a concise literature review on the impact of supermarkets on traditional retailers and suppliers, mainly from studies in other developing countries
Section III explains the research methodology and research instruments used in the study
Section IV describes the sampling frame
Section V looks at regulations pertaining to the retail sector in Indonesia
Section VI discusses supermarkets in Indonesia
Section VII examines the traditional market setting in urban centers in Indonesia
Section VIII spells out the characteristics of traders in the traditional markets
Section IX looks at changes in business performance of the traditional traders
Section X discusses the impact of supermarkets on traditional markets
Section XI consists of the conclusions and is followed by the policy recommendations
II LITERATURE REVIEW
There is a wealth of literature dealing with the two main areas where supermarkets have affected the retail sector in developing countries
supply chains and traditional retailers (see Reardon & Berdegué 2002, Reardon et al 2003, Traill 2006, and Reardon & Hopkins 2006 for literature reviews on country-specific studies)
Supermarkets choose, regulate, and tie their suppliers to a medium-term contract through their economies of scale
They either have their own distribution centers to deal directly with farmers or use specialized wholesalers to supply them with food of previously agreed quality and packaging
This practice has both positive and negative impacts on the supply chains
On the positive side, it forces the suppliers to be professional because they must transport the goods as scheduled and have audited financial reports
Secondly, the suppliers are now not as vulnerable to price changes as the prices have been agreed upon in the contract
However, the negative effects include supermarkets excluding small suppliers who cannot keep up with the quality standards, a stocking fee charge, and much longer payment periods than traditional retailers
The general impact on traditional retailers has been negative and usually follows the same pattern
The first traditional retailers to go out of business are usually those selling broad types of goods, processed foods, and dairy products, with fresh produce shops and wet markets following afterwards
After several years of competition, the traditional retailers that are usually still in business are those selling niche products or those in locations where supermarkets are legally prevented from entering
This trend is not surprising for several reasons
Firstly, supermarkets, through their economies of scale, can afford to sell cheaper and mostly higher quality products
Moreover, information on the price of each good is listed and easily accessible by the public
Thirdly, supermarkets provide a cleaner and more comfortable shopping environment, have longer opening hours, and offer more payment options such as credit and debit cards and credit financing for large household appliances
Fourthly, products sold in supermarkets, such as foodstuffs, pass quality controls and are not sold past their expiration dates
Only one study on the relationship between supermarkets and traditional markets in Indonesia was identified
CPIS (1994) find that traditional markets and supermarkets attract different segments of consumers
The former attract mostly low-end consumers, while the latter attract mainly the middle and upper class consumer
However, it is important to note that the CPIS study was conducted before the retail sector was opened to FDI in 1998
Moreover, the CPIS study finds that the goods sold in the two market types are largely complementary, with traditional markets providing fresh foods and supermarkets selling processed food and non-food goods
Related to this difference, the study states that the competitive advantage of traditional markets is the low prices and freshness of the produce, while supermarkets provide superior comfort and cleanliness
Thus, the study asserts that traditional markets and supermarkets complement each other
However, the study also warns that if traditional markets are not managed properly, they could lose their advantage over the supermarkets
Hence, policy recommendations from the CPIS study involve strengthening the traditional markets rather than creating zoning regulations or limiting the operating hours of the supermarkets
III RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
This study combines quantitative and qualitative methods
The quantitative impact evaluation uses the difference-in-difference methodology and an econometric model, two widely used methods in impact evaluation (Baker 2000)
Meanwhile, the qualitative impact evaluation is in the form of in-depth interviews with key informants
The study used a questionnaire for the traders and interview guidelines for the key informants as research instruments
The questionnaire contains questions about traders' opinions of their business and the impact of supermarkets in addition to facts regarding the traders' operations
Difference-in-Difference (DiD)
The DiD methodology requires recording conditions in two time periods before and after the treatment
In this case, the treatment is the opening of supermarkets
Furthermore, there should be control groups (i.e
traders in traditional markets with no supermarket close-by), and the characteristics of the treatment and control groups must be similar
The framework of the DiD methodology is shown in Equation 1
where T1 and T2 are the condition of the traders in traditional markets before and after the arrival of a supermarket near the traditional market respectively, and C1 and C2 are the condition of the traders in traditional markets where there is no supermarket nearby for the same period as the treatment group
If the impact is significantly different from zero, then supermarket indeed impact traditional markets
In this study, we set the baseline period at 2003 in order to ensure that the traders still have a relatively accurate recall of the conditions
Secondly, the onset of hypermarkets entering smaller cities began in late 2003, making that year suitable to act as the baseline
B Econometric Model
Whereas DiD only calculates whether the difference between control and treatment groups is statistically significant without controlling for other variables, the econometric model controls both observable and unobservable conditions that may contribute to the results
Observable conditions include the education level of the traders, type of commodities sold, and kiosk location
To control for unobservable conditions, we include location dummy variables in some specifications
We use two reduced-form econometric models
The first only uses ex-ante characteristics as the control variables, while the other uses both ex-ante conditions and their changes between 2003 and 2006
The general models are shown in Equations 2 and 3
where DCi is the proportional change in performance indicators of trader i
The performance indicators that we use are profit, earnings, and number of employees
Xi is the control variables, DXi is the changes in the control variables, and Si is the variable that differentiates the control from the treatment groups
We test two differentiating indicators
a dummy variable and the distance to the nearest supermarket
The mean and standard deviation of the control variables are in Appendix V
C In-depth Interviews
The qualitative impact assessment involves interviewing stakeholders in the retail sector
selected traditional market traders; traditional market managers; supermarket managers; relevant government officials at the district planning agencies, district trade and industry office, and district market management office; Modern Retailers' Association (APRINDO); and Traditional Traders' Association (APPSI) in the sampled districts
In total, 37 key informants were interviewed
IV SAMPLING FRAME
We focus the study in urban areas with the largest density of supermarkets
Greater Jakarta and Bandung
Greater Jakarta is comprised of Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang, Depok, and Bekasi
The traditional markets forming the treatment group were chosen purposively based on the following conditions
there is a supermarket within a fivekilometer radius from the traditional market; the supermarket must have been opened between 2003 and 2006, or if there are several supermarkets, they all must have been opened within that period; 
the traditional markets should be located in the same district as a supermarket in the control group; and the traditional market must not have been renovated after 2003
There are 98 traditional markets in Greater Jakarta and 20 traditional markets in Bandung, and approximately 188 modern retailers/shopping malls in Greater Jakarta and 80 in Bandung
Only those that have opened in the past three years are kept in the sampling frame
The locations of the markets are then overlaid with the locations of the modern retailers
Traditional markets that have no modern retailers within a radius of five kilometers, have been renovated during the past three years, or have had modern retailers in their vicinity before 2003 are dropped from the sampling frame
The traditional markets that serve as the control group are chosen according to the following conditions
the traditional market should also be located in the same district as those in the treatment group; there is no supermarket within a five-kilometer radius from the traditional market;
there will be a supermarket opening near the traditional market in 2007; and the traditional market must not have been renovated after 2003
Traditional markets that will have a supermarket opened near them in 2007 were specifically chosen because a traditional market serving an area that supermarkets are not interested in may not be comparable to those in the treatment group
As mentioned above, both treatment and control groups must be located within the same district and, if possible, neighboring subdistrict
This is important to ensure that the characteristics of the areas and sites are well matched, such as population number and population density (see Appendix IX)
Using our sampling frame, we found two traditional markets in Depok to represent Greater Jakarta, and three in Bandung
Traders in these markets form our treatment group
Two traditional markets, one each in Depok and Bandung serve as the control group
Given our sampling frame, these markets are representative of the traditional markets in urban centers in Indonesia
The traders interviewed are limited to those who have been trading in the markets for more than three years selling fresh fruit and vegetables, meat, or other basic foodstuffs
Traders selling non-food items or ready-to-eat products are not enumerated as they only represent a very small proportion of traditional traders
Finally, the respondents are randomly chosen on a probability-proportionate-tosize (PPS) sampling method basis
Table IV.1 provides the names of the markets, information on the nearest supermarket, and the number of respondents enumerated in each market
Appendix IV discusses the characteristics of each market chosen in the sample
Before discussing the traditional market setting in urban centers in Indonesia, the next two sections discuss the regulatory framework of the retail sector in Indonesia and the modern retail setting in the country
V REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF THE RETAIL SECTOR IN INDONESIA
In this section we focus on the laws at the national level and the local laws in place in Depok and Bandung
The current national regulations on retail trading are minister of trade decrees, enacted in 1997 and 1998
Given the weak standing of ministerial decrees in the Indonesian legal system, the government is currently drafting a presidential regulation on modern markets (Draft Presidential Regulation on Modern Shops and Markets)
However, the draft does not include criminal sanctions for modern markets in breach of the regulation because it is against national legislation for presidential regulations to carry sanctions
Thus, the presidential regulation standing will not differ greatly from the ministerial decree
Moreover, some articles will be difficult to implement
One example is article three paragraph four, which states that there are only one modern market and/or two modern shops allowed for every million people
Thus, the central government should consider changing the form of regulation from presidential regulation to national legislation or leaving such regulation to local government
Given Indonesia's decentralized governance system, the central government should only be responsible for monitoring domestic and foreign investors, while local governments should have full rights over issuing business and operation permits
At the local level, currently only a handful of administrations have bylaws specifically regulating the modern retail industry
The Jakarta Province Regulation No 2/2002 regarding Private Markets in Jakarta, implemented through Governor of Jakarta Decree No 44/2003, is an example of a local regulation on modern markets
The bylaw regulates the types of private markets; the classification of those markets based on upstart capital and floor size; requirements for opening a private market; and the necessary distance between a modern market and a traditional market
In other localities where such regulations are not yet in place, the local administrations base their policies on the national regulations
Table V.1 presents traditional and modern market regulation at the national level down to district/city level
Meanwhile, Appendix II presents a list of national regulations on retail trading in Indonesia for Depok, and Bandung
Our study areas, Depok and Bandung, do not yet have any specific local regulations for modern markets
The current regulations used by these administrations are the Depok City Regulation No
23/2003 on Market Management, Bandung City Regulation No
19/2001 on Market Management, and Bandung District Regulation No
27/1996, which mostly focus on traditional markets
While the regulation in Depok contains a chapter on modern markets, it is limited to regulating the application procedure for an operating permit and does not mention issues such as zoning or partnerships between modern markets and small and medium enterprises
However, the Bandung administration is currently drafting a bylaw to regulate modern markets
Similar to Jakarta's provincial regulation, this bylaw would include a definition and classification of modern markets, the distance required between a modern market and a traditional market, an obligation for modern markets to collaborate with small and medium enterprises, and sanctions for modern markets that fail to comply with the law
While rich in definitions, both the draft regulation on modern markets and the regulations on market management do not describe specific duties and responsibilities for the respective administrations' Office of Market Management
Similarly, they do not contain rights or responsibilities of traders and market operators, nor any sanctions for the administration or the traders for noncompliance
Finally, the socialization of these regulations is weak
In the Depok administration, even the Office of Industry and Trade staff are unaware that the market management regulation contains a chapter on modern markets
VI SUPERMARKETS IN URBAN CENTERS IN INDONESIA
A Supermarkets in Indonesia
Supermarkets in Indonesia are all privately owned and their permits are issued by the central government's Department of Trade
Local governments usually have no authority to refuse permits issued by the central government, although some require supermarkets to apply for a local permit
As an example, the Depok government requires supermarkets to have an IUPM (Permit for Modern Market Business, issued by the Department of Trade) and an IP3M (Principle Permit for Modern Market Establishment, issued by the Depok Office of Trade and Industry)
In addition to the centrally issued permit, the supermarkets usually have to obtain other local permits that should be obtained by any private business, such as an IMB (Building License) and HO (Disturbance Permit)
The situation is similar in Bandung, although the Bandung administration has prepared a draft law on modern retailers
The first supermarket in Indonesia was opened in the 1970s, with the numbers rapidly multiplying between 1977 and 1992 by an average of 85% each year
Hypermarkets first appeared in 1998, with Carrefour and Continent (later taken over by Carrefour) opening their first stores in Jakarta
From 1998 to 2003, hypermarkets grew by 27% a year, from 8 to 49 stores
While it is difficult to ascertain the number of supermarkets and hypermarkets in the whole country, as of 2003, around 200 supermarkets and hypermarkets were owned by the top ten retailers (PricewaterhouseCoopers 2004)
The growth of supermarkets in terms of market share is also impressive
A World Bank report (2007) found that in 1999 the modern market made up only 11% of the total market share for food
By 2004, that number had almost tripled (30%)
In terms of sales, the study finds that supermarket sales grow by an average of 15% while traditional retail sales decline by 2% per year
PricewaterhouseCoopers (2004) predicted that supermarket sales will increase by 50% between 2004 and 2007, with hypermarket sales growing by 70% in the same period
According to the A.C. Nielsen Asia Pacific Retail and Shopper Trend 2005 report, the public's proclivity to shop in traditional markets has decreased by an average of 2% per year
Despite the rapid growth in the number of supermarkets in Indonesia, however, residents living outside Jakarta and the few other small urban centers on Java remain relatively untouched 86% of all hypermarkets are located on Java
The profile of the five largest supermarket chains in Indonesia is discussed below
Out of these, Carrefour and Superindo chains have a foreign company as majority shareholder
These large chains operate in large urban centers in Indonesia, both on and off Java
Three of the five operate both supermarkets and hypermarkets, Carrefour exclusively operates hypermarkets, and Superindo only operates supermarkets
In addition to these large chains, there are smaller supermarket chains, mainly operating outside Jakarta and focusing in a single region
We list the major retailers in a descending order based on their sales figures
Matahari, the largest retailer in Indonesia, opened its first department store in 1958
Its first supermarket was opened in 1995
In 2002, Matahari created two separate business entities, one managing department stores, the other supermarkets
It then opened its first hypermarket, aptly named Hypermart, in 2004
Matahari's combined sales in 2005 were Rp7 trillion (Matahari 2006)
At the end of 2005, Matahari had 37 supermarkets and 17 Hypermarts, with more planned in the future
The second largest retailer is also one of the youngest in the country
Carrefour entered Indonesia in 1998, and was the pioneer of hypermarkets in the country together with Continent, which it took over in 2000
In 2004 Carrefour had 15 hypermarkets
Total sales in 2004 were Rp4.9 trillion (PricewaterhouseCoopers 2005)
The third major player, Hero, is the largest and oldest domestic supermarket chain in Indonesia
It began operations in the 1970s, and by 2005 it had 99 supermarkets
Currently, around 30% of Hero's shares are owned by Dairy Farm International (DFI), a Hong Kong-based firm
In 2002, Hero joined the hypermarket boom in Indonesia by opening Giant, the Malaysian retail brand also owned by DFI
In 2004 there were 10 Giant stores in Indonesia
Hero's total combined sales in 2004 were worth Rp3.8 trillion (Pricewaterhouse Coopers 2005)
The fourth-ranked player, Alfa, began operations in 1989 and by 2004 it had a total of 35 supermarkets and hypermarkets across Indonesia
Its retail sales in 2004 were worth Rp3.3 trillion (PricewaterhouseCoopers 2005)
Finally, the fifth largest retailer is Superindo, which began trading in 1997 and in 2003 had 38 supermarkets
It is a private company, and Delhaize, a Belgian retailer, owns a large proportion of its shares
Superindo's total sales in 2003 were worth Rp985 billion (PricewaterhouseCoopers 2004)
It is also useful to briefly discuss supermarket business practices
The goods sold by supermarkets are mostly relatively high quality, properly price-tagged, competitively priced, and are sometimes offered on bulk discounts
Moreover, they offer multiple payment options, ranging from cash and credit cards to financing for larger items
The stores are bright, clean, and have functioning amenities such as toilets and food courts
A visit to a supermarket's headquarters found that goods procurement is conducted by the merchandising department, based on contractual and non-contractual agreements
A contract specifies the price and quantity of the goods according to the agreement, to be delivered according to a specific schedule
The goods in this contract category are usually vegetables and meats, which must comply with packaging standardization and must pass the standards of the central government's Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM)
Goods under contract are normally procured by consignment
In contrast, the off-contract agreements are made via negotiations on a case-by-case basis and are valid for all products
In addition, it is normal for supermarkets to charge a display fee and impose long payment periods
Supermarkets exercise a mixture of price and non-price strategies to attract customers and to compete with other retailers
Our observations showed that various pricing strategies are used, such as limit pricing strategies to deter new entrants; predatory pricing strategies to compete with other incumbents; 
and inter-temporal price discrimination which means charging different prices at different times, such as giving discounts on the weekend or between particular hours
In addition, supermarkets also survey traditional markets to get a sense of the market price levels, which they will undercut
Finally, crosssubsidy practices are often conducted, where they run losses on some merchandise in order to win over the competition
Examples of non-price strategies used by the supermarkets are extended store opening hours, especially on weekends when the store are open until late at night; bundling and tying, where bundled goods are sold for less than if sold separately; 
free public transport for customers and free parking; and the most important strategy of vigorous advertising campaigns
Supermarkets are several levels above traditional markets in most of these aspects of competition
While supermarkets do not perceive traditional markets as their main competitors, a supermarket manager we interviewed warned that traditional markets will be unable to survive for long if the local government does nothing to upgrade their competitiveness
B The Modern Retail Settings in Depok and Bandung
As a city buffering Jakarta, Depok has been experiencing quite rapid economic and population growth
Although Depok has been home to supermarkets for the last decade, 2004 and 2005 saw the intense construction of new supermarkets
Several established supermarkets were driven out of business by the new ones as a result
There has also been a mushrooming of minimarkets and other forms of modern retailers
There are currently 62 modern retailers in Depok, 42 of which are minimarkets
Three supermarket brands began operations and one brand opened its second store in Depok between July 2005 and March 2006 alone
Carrefour; Hypermart, complementing a Hypermart that opened on the border between Depok and Jakarta; Giant, complementing another that was opened in 2003; and Superindo
These supermarkets were opened alongside each other on one strip of road
The number of modern retailers in Depok is slated to increase in the future especially minimarkets, due to the relative ease in obtaining a permit and the relatively small amount of capital needed to open a minimarket
However, no applications to establish a new supermarket were made in 2006
Only one new supermarket will open in 2007 in Depok, near Musi Market, the market that acts as a control in this study
However, this slow down is only temporary expansion is set to increase again due several reasons, such as the establishment of new expressways connecting Depok to neighboring cities, and Depok's continuing population growth
In Bandung, the first department store was opened in 1977 and the first supermarket followed in 1979
The explosion in the number of supermarkets began in 2002
They are mostly located in the city center, often side by side due to intense competition
While such competition has forced some supermarkets to close mainly local chains like Merlin and Ria the construction of new supermarkets continues
As of 2006, Bandung was home to 65 supermarkets, 6 hypermarkets, and 3 modern wholesalers, in addition to countless minimarkets
Just one week after our field visit, a supermarket was opened 200 meters from Banjaran Market, one of our control markets
VII TRADITIONAL MARKETS IN URBAN CENTERS IN INDONESIA
In contrast to supermarkets, most traditional markets are owned by the local government
Local governments in Indonesia usually have an Office of Market Management (OMM), or Dinas Pasar, which manages traditional markets
This office either manages the markets on its own or in cooperation with private companies
The cooperation method usually involves giving a private company a permit to build or operate a traditional market under a build, operate, and transfer (BOT) scheme, with the private company making a set payment to the OMM each year
There are several classes of traditional market, usually based on their area (in square meters) and number of traders
The classification methods differ between each local government, but usually Class I or Class A markets are the largest
It is the norm for the OMM to set an annual income target for each market manager, which usually increases each year
For the past several years, the proportion of OMM revenue to local revenue (PAD) in both Depok and Bandung ranged from 1.5% to 3% (see Appendix VI)
Failure to meet the target usually results in the replacement of the market manager
It is therefore unsurprising to observe that many market managers occupy themselves with the sole task of meeting their target as opposed to properly managing the market
There were nine traditional markets in Depok as of 2006
The newest are Depok Jaya and Sentra UKM, while Agung underwent a complete renovation in 2004
Table VII.1 shows the list of markets
The markets are divided into three classes, based mainly on the services provided for traders and facilities available in the markets
The market tax collected from Class I markets is the highest, while that of Class III markets is the lowest
Several types of market services fees (retribusi) are collected from customers and both traders located inside the markets and street vendors located within a 300-meter radius
This includes charges for parking, cleaning, and unloading
As of 2004, the Depok OMM's total income target from these retribusi was Rp1.6 billion double the target for 2001 (see Appendix VI)
In addition, a trader in a traditional market in Depok is required to own an SKHPTB (Letter of Rights to Use Kiosk), which is valid for 20 years but must be renewed every five years, and also a KTB (Trading ID Card), which should be renewed annually
In Bandung, there are 49 traditional markets, out of which 36 are owned and operated by the Bandung OMM, while the rest are privately owned and operated
The government markets are distributed across 17 of Bandung's 26 subdistricts
The market classification system in Bandung is different to Depok, and is based on number of traders and market location
Class I markets have more than 235 kiosks, 250 traders, and are located on a main road
If not located on a main road, a market needs to have at least 475 kiosk and 500 traders in order to be classified as Class I
Class II markets have fewer kiosks or traders, and Class III markets have the least
Of the 36 government markets, six are Class I, 21 are Class II, and 9 are Class III markets
There are currently only 26 market managers for the 36 markets some managers are responsible for more than one market
All three treatment markets that we visited are Class II markets
The Bandung OMM is currently revitalizing 13 markets, mostly by adding parking space and providing trading space in the market for the street vendors
In addition, it has signed agreements with several private companies to build and operate markets on land owned by the Bandung administration
Similar to the Depok OMM, the Bandung OMM sets an annual retribusi target for each market, totaling Rp4.6 billion in 2006 (see Appendix VI)
The retribusi paid by each trader differs based on the market class, location of kiosk, type of goods sold, and kiosk size
Unlike in Depok, the market management in Bandung only collects retribusi for the kiosk and security, while the Bandung Office of Waste Management collects retribusi for cleaning and the Bandung Office of Transportation collects parking retribusi
The amount of retribusi paid by each trader for security also differs, ranging between Rp300 and Rp600 per day, depending on their kiosk's location
As in Depok, the markets in Bandung are increasingly surrounded by street vendors usually newly relocated traders or market traders who move out in order to win the customers or take advantage of the lower amount of retribusi paid when trading on the street
VIII THE NATURE OF COMPETITION IN THE TRADITIONAL MARKET
This section examines the nature of competition for traders in traditional markets
The results are from the perspective of traders in both the control and treatment group (see also Appendix VII)
Table VIII.1 notes the types of commodities sold in traditional markets and the proportion of traders selling each commodity
In addition to these commodities, there are a small number of vendors selling ready-to-eat food and beverages
Each trader sells an average of two types of commodities
The highest proportion of traders sells fresh vegetables, followed by food and beverage ingredients
The high level of competition in the market results in competitive pricing and a higher quality of produce
In contrast, the prices of rice and meat, commodities with fewer traders, tend to be more volatile and increase more frequently
Table VIII.2 shows that small stores make up the largest share of buyers, both in terms of number of consumers and value of goods bought
In terms of customer numbers, 41.5% of traders said that their main customer is a small store
Combined with the share of restaurants and mobile vendors, this means that most goods are sold in bulk
Goods purchased for direct household consumption make up only one third of the total value of goods sold in traditional markets
Table VIII.3a shows the parties that respondents consider as the toughest competitors and the main strategies employed to attract customers
Most traders perceive their fellow traders as their toughest competitors, while supermarkets ranked second, followed by street vendors
Furthermore, quite a large share of respondents does not believe that they have any competitors
Given that street vendors mostly sell near the markets, more than half of the respondents identify other traders in or near their market as their main competition
When asked about strategies employed to attract buyers, almost 40% of respondents state politeness as the key to their business success
The second and third-ranked strategies are more tangible
quality and price
Interestingly, about 10% of traders have no strategy
While a substantial proportion of respondents consider supermarkets as one of their competitors, the majority does not employ any strategy specifically aimed at competing with the supermarkets
Table VIII.3b specifically describes the toughest competitors as considered by respondents in the control and treatment markets
Traders in the control markets perceive fellow traders in the market as their primary competitors, followed by street vendors
On the other hand, 42% of traders in the treatment markets identify supermarkets as their toughest competitors
However, the combined share of the competitors within and around the traditional markets is still higher than the proportion of supermarkets
Surprisingly, quite a large share of respondents cannot identify their primary competitors
Table VIII.4 notes traders' main suppliers and the most used method of payment to the suppliers
More than 40% of traders use professional suppliers, another 31% mostly go to traditional wholesale markets, and only 6% communicate directly with producers
However, most traders usually do not rely on only one supplier
Around 8% get their goods from other traditional markets
Cash is the main method of payment used
This is unsurprising, given that most traders are small-scale, and therefore have no leverage to convince suppliers to provide credit
Again, this contrasts the usual supply practices in supermarkets
The final characteristic of traders in traditional markets we examined is their source of working capital, which is shown in Table VIII.5
Almost 90% of traders use their own source of capital, around 2% receive capital from informal sources, and the rest receive credit from banks, including commercial banks, loan sharks, and cooperatives
The majority of those who source their capital from banks are clients of commercial banks, both private and government-owned
In conclusion, most traders in traditional markets either have no access to credit or do not apply for credit
They pay their suppliers in cash and so undertake all the risks themselves, including the risk of not being able to sell before the goods expire
They rely largely on politeness to attract and maintain their customers as opposed to employing a more credible business strategy
Their two main rivals are other traders, both inside and outside the market building
Given that the majority of their customers are not households, they largely rely on a few loyal customers rather than on a large customer base
While this may protect them from having to engage in a fierce competition, losing only one or two customers may be a debilitating blow
Compared with the business practices employed by supermarkets as discussed in Section VI, according to the traders we interviewed, the ability to haggle and discounts for loyal customers are the only two aspects where traditional markets hold an advantage over the supermarkets
Furthermore, an intimate atmosphere is one of the strong points of a traditional market (see Appendix VIII)
IX BUSINESS PERFORMANCE OF TRADERS IN TRADITIONAL MARKETS, 2003-2006
This section examines the changes in traders' business performance over the past three years
The questionnaire recorded two sources of information regarding the traders' business performance and the impact of supermarkets
The first is data on the traders earnings and profit levels in both 2003 and 2006
The second is their opinions regarding the same variables
The questionnaire collected the data first in order to maintain the respondents' objectivity
The opinions were asked towards the end of the interview
On average, in-depth interview respondents declared that both profits and earnings have declined in the past three years
Some traders in Cisalak, particularly those selling basic foodstuffs and vegetables, admit that their income has dropped significantly in the last three years
One trader even claims that his income and profits have dropped by 60% compared to 2003
In addition, traditional traders and market managers predict that the number of daily buyers has dropped by 40-50%
Similarly, traders in Tugu have experienced a decline in income of up to 50%
According to the APPSI representative of Tugu, the number of buyers has declined by about 40%
Moreover, one of the traders there says that the number of buyers is now only half of that three years ago
Surprisingly, however, the number of traders has increased in that time
Most of the new traders are street vendors, using the unoccupied spaces around the market building as places to trade
Contrary to the increasing number of traders in Tugu, traders in Musi have declined by a quarter, demonstrated by the large number of empty kiosks and counters
This is caused by a decrease in the number of buyers and the fact that many traders have become street vendors, as they believe it is more profitable than trading inside the market
Most of the traders who move to the street sell vegetables and basic foodstuffs
However, several traders gave information that some traders have become bankrupt and returned to their hometowns
In general, the income of traders in all markets has declined compared to 2003
According to one trader, the conditions at Musi were totally different in 2003, when there were fewer street vendors surrounding the market
Competition amongst the traders was healthy
However, the encroachment of more and more street vendors has caused a significant decline in the earnings and profit of traditional traders in Musi
Another vegetable and daily foodstuffs seller discloses that his daily earnings and profit have fallen by up to 50%
He further says that in 2003 the buyers were still coming until 19:00, but nowadays they only come until 10:00
The conditions in Bandung are similar
Since 2003 many traders in Pamoyanan have been forced to close down because they are unable to pay for their kiosks
According to a market manager, 18 kiosks and 4 counters have closed in the past two years
Among the four markets visited in Bandung, 76% of traders claim that there are now fewer customers
This has impacted the profit and earnings of these traders
Overall, 60% and 67% of traders in the two treatment markets in Bandung, Leuwipanjang and Pamoyanan, admit to experiencing a reduction in earnings and profit respectively
In Banjaran Market, meanwhile, 78% of traders claim that their earnings have declined, with 81% experienced declining in profits
From the quantitative analysis, Table IX.1 shows the mean proportional change in profit and earnings among the traders
It shows that traders in both treatment and control groups have experienced a decline in their business performance over the past three years
The decline in profit is greater than in earnings, which may indicate that the traders prioritize ability to sell above making profits
It is important to note that the negative figures in the table do not mean that traders are losing money; rather it shows that on average their profit has declined by 20% over the past three years
It is also worth noting that the decline in the objective indicators is smaller than what was claimed during the in-depth interviews
The opinions given by traders as recorded in the questionnaire mostly confirm the decline
Around 68% of traders claim that their earnings have declined, while 74% believe that they are making less profit than 2003
In total, 66% state that both their earnings and profits have declined
In-depth interviews reveal four main issues that explain the causes for the downturn in business in both treatment and control markets
first, the lack of basic infrastructure in the markets; second, the intense competition with street vendors occupying areas around the market; thirdly, lack of funds for business expansion; fourth, the decline in their customers purchasing power due to the fuel price increase in 2005
In addition, some traditional traders in the treatment markets also say that the supermarkets are also taking away some of their business
This is especially the case in Pamoyanan, where the market is located directly next to the supermarket, where the customer base is mainly comprised of middle-class households, and where there is not a problem with street vendors
In Depok, the main problem lies with organizing the traders, especially the street vendors; the poorly maintained condition of market buildings; transportation problems, such as limited parking lots and access road to the market; lack of security; uncomfortable shopping conditions; and problems with market cleanliness, such as lack of garbage disposal facilities and malfunctioning drainage systems
Furthermore, little punishment is handed out to traders who violate market regulations, and cooperation between the Depok OMM and market managers is weak
Market managers do not have the power to make the needed changes; their main task, as assigned by the OMM, is to collect retribusi in order to achieve the set target
Other than internal problems, the decline of the markets in Depok is caused by fierce competition with street vendors
There are around 100 street vendors around Tugu Market, 830 in the proximity of Cisalak Market, and 154 near Musi Market
Although the Depok administration has been removing the street vendors, many of them keep coming back, and in Cisalak and Musi they have blocked the access roads into the markets
The street in front of Cisalak and Tugu is swamped with the vendors, forcing customers with vehicles to park one kilometer away
This is also the case in Musi, where an increasing number of houses have become trading kiosks
Traders, APPSI, and market managers explicitly state that the street vendors are the main cause of the drastic drop in the number of buyers, income, and profit
As previously noted, the traders inside the market, especially in Cisalak and Musi, consider the street vendors as one of their main competitors, which has resulted in the increasingly intense competition between traders inside the markets
The last problem in Depok is related to funding, as most traditional traders in Depok find it difficult to improve their business
The main underlying factors for this are considered to be the difficulty of securing commercial loans and the limited participation of the Depok administration
In terms of government assistance, in early 2005 the Depok administration issued only ten traders from each market with long-term loans of Rp3-5 million each
The loan attracts interest of 2% per year and should be repaid within two years
Most of the traders cannot fulfill the requirements set by the banks for commercial loans
The main complaint of traders in Bandung is also related to the increasing number of street vendors around the market
In Leuwipanjang, the problem is exacerbated by the change in public transport routes
Moreover, a larger and cleaner traditional wholesale market, Caringin, not far from Leuwipanjang has also started to sell retail in order to survive the competition with supermarkets
The decision of the local administration to alter the public transport route has also made it difficult for customers wanting to go to the Pamoyanan market
Furthermore, Hero opened 300 meters from the Pamoyanan market in 2003, and traders believe this is the main cause of the decline
According to traders in Bandung, another major cause of the decline is the reduced purchasing power of buyers due to the fuel price increase
Smaller causes of the decline are the bird flu scare and the issue of formaldehyde in processed food
Moving into the quantitative results, Table IX.2 shows the causes of the decline as given in the questionnaire by traders
The decreasing number of buyers is attributed as the main cause of the downturn, which is consistent with the qualitative results
This is followed by increased competition with other traders in the market, increased competition with supermarkets, and increase in general prices of the goods
While traders employ few specific strategies, through the in-depth interviews we find that a small number of traders have applied new marketing strategies
These include adding more variation to the merchandise, providing good customer service, maintaining quality of the goods, delivering goods to the buyers homes, giving discounts for customers, and even matching supermarket prices
APPSI has been conducting a two-pronged strategy to increase the business performance of traditional markets
Firstly, they are lobbying for a zoning approach for supermarkets, where supermarkets can only operate in the suburbs and at some distance from traditional markets
Secondly, they are campaigning for local governments to improve their treatment of traditional markets, for example by providing credit to the traders and subsidizing the kiosk rental fee
X THE IMPACT OF SUPERMARKETS ON TRADITIONAL MARKETS
This section specifically investigates the contribution of supermarkets to the decline
The qualitative analysis results are discussed first
In Depok, Giant Cimanggis and Medali Mas are the supermarkets located near Cisalak and Tugu
According to the traders, Medali Mas has not significantly impacted their businesses, while Giant has absorbed a large number of buyers
Some traders believe that Giant has caused a decline in their earnings and profit
The traders believe that in the future, the existence of supermarkets will disturb the existence of traditional markets because they sell identical products for similar or lower prices
Furthermore, the facilities and infrastructures in supermarkets ensure a more comfortable and secure feeling
Moreover, Giant provides discounts on the weekend
In contrast to the traders, one officer from the Depok OMM claims that the existence of supermarkets and hypermarkets around the traditional markets has had little or no impact on the traditional markets
However, with the exception of Pamoyanan, the traders also claim that the impact of the supermarkets is not as significant as the impact caused by the internal problems prevalent in their markets
In addition, they admit that there is a slight difference in the types of buyers coming to traditional and modern markets, with mobile vendors and small stores still preferring to shop at traditional markets
In one interview, the traders declare that they are ready to compete as long as the market infrastructures and amenities are improved (see Boxes 1 and 2)
In Bandung, traders in Sederhana complain about the newly built Carrefour
Traders selling basic foodstuffs and other household necessities are especially feeling its impact
In contrast, traders in Leuwipanjang do not really feel the impact of the supermarkets
Rather, their main complaint surrounds the existence of street vendors
Their complaints echoed by traders in Sederhana
On the other hand, traders in Pamoyanan claim that the Hero has been the main culprit of the decline in their business
The Bandung Chapter of APPSI strongly opposes the supermarkets
They claim that the government has abandoned traders in traditional markets by allowing supermarkets to open too close to the traditional markets
While APPSI only represents its members, a minority of traders, it has a valid point since the Bandung administration indeed repeatedly violates its own spatial plan in order to accommodate the supermarkets
From our observation, there are several factors that could explain why one traditional market may be impacted while others are not
First is the distance between the traditional market and the supermarket, where traditional markets that are relatively near supermarkets are more severely impacted
A second, more important factor is the types of buyers in the traditional markets
Traditional markets whose main customers are middle-class households, such as Pamoyanan, feel the deepest impact of the supermarkets
In order to measure how accurate those opinions are, a quantitative analysis was conducted using objective performance indicators
Table X.1 provides the results of the DiD (difference-in-difference) impact evaluation
This analysis found that the differences in changes in profit and earnings between the treatment and control groups are not significantly different from zero
This implies that the decline in earnings and profit of traditional markets cannot be attributed to the presence of supermarkets near the traditional markets
The finding that the control group also experienced declines in both profit and earnings is very interesting
It is even more surprising to find that the control group experienced a larger decline in terms of profit compared to the treatment group
At the very least, this finding allows us to assume the non-existence selection bias in our study, because traders who went bankrupt in the treatment market would most likely still go out of business even without the existence of supermarkets
Econometric methods were used for the second quantitative analysis
Following Equations 2 and 3 in Section III, there are three large sets of controls
The first is variables that control the condition of the traders in 2003
The second set controls for the changes in conditions between 2003 and 2006, 
The last set of control variables attempts to control for unobserved location-specific variables by including a dummy for Depok
In total, we conducted 12 estimations each using three dependent variables
proportional change in earnings, profits, and number of employees
In addition, we also use two variables as indicators of the presence of supermarkets
a dummy variable and the distance of a market to the nearest supermarket
The results are shown in Table X.2
In columns 1.6 we use the dummy of treatment as our variable of interest
Note that column 1 is essentially the same as the result for earnings DiD in Table X.1
The fit of the model increases as we include more control variables, going from almost zero in column 1 to 0.3 in column 6
Looking specifically at the supermarket/treatment dummy, the sign of the coefficient is negative in columns 1 and 4, but positive in columns 2, 3, 5, and 6
However, none of the supermarket dummies in the specifications are statistically significant
In columns 7-12, we use distance to the respective supermarkets as an indicator of possible impact, as opposed to the dummy variable
Similar to the first set of estimations, including more control variables improves the explanatory power of the model
Columns 13-24 replicate columns 1-12, only we use profit as the dependent variable
Column 13 has the same result as the profit DiD evaluation in Table X.1
Looking across the board, we do not find any significant impact in either the dummy or distance variable
As opposed to columns 1-12, however, the signs of the coefficients do not switch between the simple models and those with added controls
In columns 25-36, employee numbers have been employed as the performance indicator
Looking specifically at the distance to the respective supermarket, the sign of the coefficient in columns 32, 33, 35, and 36 is positive, although very close to zero, and the coefficients in those columns are statistically significant
This provides initial evidence that with more control variables, the impact of supermarkets on traditional markets, especially on employee numbers, is statistically significant
The farther the distance of a traditional market to a supermarket, the higher the ability of traders to hire more employees
Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the 2003 level control variables set is the one that caused the impact indicator to become significant
The final issue relates to the traders who went out of business due to the supermarkets
While we do not directly visit traders who have gone out of business due to the competition from supermarkets
This information was gathered from the traders in the treatment group through the questionnaire and in-depth interviews
In addition, the managers of traditional markets and traditional traders' association were asked about this issue
Some of those no longer trading in Cisalak Market moved to Cibubur Market
Several others opened their own businesses from home, and the rest worked in the informal sector
In Musi Market, many traders have become street vendors
In addition, there are also some who went bankrupt and returned to their hometowns
Most traders who moved to the streets surrounding the market are vegetables and basic foodstuffs traders
As is the case in Cisalak Market, in Bandung, many traders from Leuwipanjang moved to smaller markets, and more are becoming street vendors
In the questionnaire, traders stated that a third of those who went bankrupt have mostly moved to another market, while half have become unemployed
The rest have changed employment types, such as becoming a bus driver or motorcycle taxi operator
The bankrupt traders may be a cause for concern if there is enough reason to believe that those going out of business in the treatment markets would not have experienced it had there been no supermarkets nearby
However, we believe that that is not the case in this study
Firstly, the control markets experienced higher losses in terms of profits compared to the treatment markets
Secondly, there are comparable earnings in the control markets
Thirdly, not every treatment market experienced a decline in number of traders
In conclusion, only a small proportion of traders in the treatment group know of a bankrupt trader, and we find no evidence that the bankruptcy in the treatment markets is related to the supermarkets
XI CONCLUSIONS
Supermarkets have been around in major urban centers in Indonesia for the last three decades
At the onset of the liberalization of the retail sector in 1998, however, foreign supermarket operators began entering the country, sparking a fierce competition with local operators
Some corners claim that traditional markets are the real victims of the intense competition, as they lose their customers due to the cheaper and higher quality products and the more comfortable shopping environment that supermarkets provide
Therefore, there are calls to limit the construction of supermarkets, especially in locations near traditional markets
This study investigates the truth behind these claims by measuring the impact of supermarkets on traditional market traders in Indonesia's urban centers
Primarily quantitative research methods have been employed, and qualitative research was conducted to support the quantitative findings
The quantitative methods utilize the DiD and econometric methods
The qualitative method consists of in-depth interviews with APPSI, APRINDO, traditional market managers, traditional market traders, supermarket officials, and officials from relevant local government agencies
Five traditional markets were chosen as the treatment group and two traditional markets were chosen as the control group
The sampling frame ensures that these markets are representative of traditional markets in urban areas in Indonesia
Furthermore, it also ensures that the treatment and control groups have similar characteristics other than their proximity to supermarkets
Two treatment markets and one control market are located in Depok, an urban center near Jakarta, while the rest are located in the Greater Bandung area, the capital of West Java Province
Randomly selected traders in these markets were interviewed using a questionnaire
These traders are representative of the traditional markets
In addition, we conducted 37 in-depth interviews with the aforementioned stakeholders
On average, traders in both treatment and control markets have experienced a decline in their business over the past three years
In the in-depth interviews, respondents revealed the main causes for this decline as the weakened purchasing power of their customers due to the fuel price increases, and the increased competition with street vendors who occupy the parking spaces and other areas surrounding the markets, even blocking the market entrance
The third cause attributed to the decline in business for traditional market traders is supermarkets
This was especially found for traders in the treatment group
It should also be noted that supermarkets were identified as the primary cause of the decline in business by traders in Pamoyanan, the only market in the study where the majority of market customers are middle-class households, and which also does not have a problem with street vendors
The quantitative impact analysis finds mixed statistical results for various performance indicators of traditional markets, such as profits, earnings, and employee numbers
Out of these performance indicators, supermarkets only statistically impact traditional markets through the number of employees hired by the traditional traders
The results indicate that traditional traders hire fewer employees the closer they are to a supermarket and vice versa
These results are further confirmed by the qualitative analysis findings that supermarkets are not the main cause of the decline among traditional markets
The traders, market managers, and APPSI representatives all state that the main steps which should be undertaken to ensure their survival are the improvement of traditional market infrastructure, organization of the street vendors, and the implementation of better market management practices
The traders explicitly state their confidence that supermarkets would not drive them out of business if the above conditions were met
While there is indeed evidence that traders have gone out of business during the last three years
The reasons for this are more complex than the entry of supermarkets alone
Most business closures are associated with internal market and personal problems
In addition, traders who mainly sell to non-households and have maintained a good relationship with their customers over a long period of time are more likely to stay in business
The results above are further confirmed the success story of a traditional market in Tangerang, which has retained its customers in spite of the construction of a new supermarket nearby (Pikiran Rakyat 2006; Tabloid Nova 2006)
This market is clean, safe, has ample parking space, and has sufficient amenities
This proves that a competitive traditional market is able to successfully compete with and exist near supermarkets
XII POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
The policy recommendations to ensure a thriving traditional market environment revolve around increasing the competitiveness of the traditional market
This involves several steps
First, improve the infrastructure in the traditional markets
This includes ensuring proper hygiene, sufficient cleanliness, ample lighting, and an overall comfortable environment
The current two-story market building design is not popular among traders because customers are unwilling to go to the upper floor
In order to do this, local governments and private traditional market managers must go beyond considering traditional markets only as a source of income
They must actually invest in the upgrade of traditional markets and set a minimum standard of services
This also entails appointing qualified people as market managers and giving them enough authority to make decisions, so they do not act solely as retribusi collectors
It is also important to enhance the performance of market managers either by providing training or by regular evaluation
Furthermore, the market manager should consistently coordinate with traders in order to achieve better market management
A joint venture between local government and the private sector might also be a solution to increase the competitiveness of traditional markets, as has been the case in the Bumi Serpong Damai Market
Secondly, local governments should organize the street vendors, either by providing them with kiosks inside the traditional markets or by enforcing the law banning them from opening stalls around a traditional market
It is imperative that these vendors are kept from blocking the market entrance
The third recommendation pertains to the traders themselves
Most traders have no option but to pay their suppliers with cash and use their own capital for the business
On one hand, this poses a constraint for business expansion
On the other hand, it means that traders have to undertake all the risks associated with doing business
Given that it is not common practice to insure a business, the traders are vulnerable to even a small shock
It is therefore worth investigating the types of insurance suitable for traders and assisting them should they need additional capital to finance their expansion
Finally, the conditions uncovered in our study areas point to a need for the thorough regulation of modern markets, including the regulation of such issues as the rights and responsibilities of the market operators and the local administration, and also sanctions for breaching the regulations
While some administrations may deem it necessary to have a separate bylaw, improvements to the current bylaw should be sufficient
Moreover, it is more important to ensure that all stakeholders understand the regulations, and that both levels of government should act in strict accordance to them
To ensure fair competition amongst traditional and modern retailers, it is necessary that national and regional level governments have control mechanisms and monitoring systems to keep the playing field fair
I Background 
Since the deregulation of the retail industry in 1998, the number of supermarkets, hypermarkets, and minimarkets (collectively coined "modern market") in Indonesia has skyrocketed
Several groups claim that the resulting intense competition with modern markets has caused the decline of the traditional market
In 2006, SMERU conducted a study on the impact of supermarkets on traditional markets in Indonesia's urban centers
The study was conducted in Depok and Bandung, and used a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods
Traditional traders in seven traditional markets (five treatment and two control markets) were interviewed using a questionnaire, and in-depth interviews were conducted with traditional market managers, supermarket officials, officials from relevant local government agencies, and representatives from the Traditional Traders' Association (APPSI) and the Modern Retailer Association (Aprindo)
II Findings 
While the quantitative findings show that supermarkets have a statistically significant impact on the number of employees in traditional markets, no statistically significant impact on either earnings or profit of traditional traders was found
The qualitative findings suggest that the decline in traditional markets is mostly caused by internal problems, from which supermarkets benefit
The majority of traders in both treatment and control markets have experienced a decline in business since 2003
In-depth interviews reveal four main issues that explain the causes for the downturn in business in both treatment and control markets
First, the lack of basic infrastructure in the markets; second, the intense competition with street vendors occupying areas around the market; third, lack of funds for business expansion; fourth, the decline in their customers' purchasing power due to the fuel price increase in 2005
In addition, some traditional traders in the treatment markets also say that the supermarkets have contributed to the decline in business
The study also finds that almost 90% of traditional traders pay their suppliers in cash, and 88% use their own funds for working capital
Most do not have any form of business insurance
Traditional traders are thus highly susceptible to any fluctuation in earnings, and fully bear the risk for any loss of their merchandise
Poor access to alternative sources of capital also acts as a major constraint for any traditional traders wishing to expand their business
III Recommendations 
1 Improve Market Management Systems 
In order to properly address the specific issues that plague traditional markets, market management systems must be improved
Due to pressures to reach retribusi (market services fees) targets, the majority of market managers currently occupy their time with the sole task of retribusi collection
The Office of Market Management (OMM) should thus ensure that retribusi targets are realistic, and that the task of retribusi collection is delegated appropriately
Moreover, market managers must be sufficiently qualified and be given the authority to make market management decisions
Market managers should also be encouraged to consult and coordinate with traders in order to achieve better market management
A joint venture between local government and the private sector such as that in the Bumi Serpong Damai area may help to facilitate improvements in market management and infrastructure
2 Improve Traditional Market Infrastructure 
In order to attract more customers, the general environment within traditional markets must be improved
Ample ventilation and lighting, adequate garbage disposal facilities for traders, and the monitoring and maintenance of hygiene and general cleanliness levels must all be ensured
Health and safety regulations must be met and regular compliance monitoring should be conducted by local governments in order to restore consumer confidence
In addition, sufficient and easily accessible parking facilities are required
Public transportation routes should also service traditional markets
The current multi-storied market building design is not popular among traders, as customers are unwilling to go to either upper or basement levels
However, markets already located in multi-story buildings can be improved by ensuring that stairways are not too steep, are well lit, and are clear of obstacles
Each floor should be dedicated to particular types of goods, which will increase customer flow to the basement and upper floors
3 Organize Street Vendors 
Organizing street vendors, by enforcing regulations banning street vendors from opening stalls around a traditional market, and moving them instead to kiosks inside the market building 
This will have a significant positive impact on trade levels at traditional markets
This will also ensure a fairer system, whereby all traders are subject to the same retribusi regulations, 
and will mean that shoppers are required to enter the market buildings in order to make their purchases
4 Provide Support to Traditional Traders 
a Examining business insurance options 
Local government should support the examination of suitable business insurance options for traditional traders, to cover loss of stock and assets
Any option under consideration must be accessible and affordable for traditional market traders
Information regarding insurance and how it helps to protect traditional traders against loss should also be disseminated within traditional markets
b Capital assistance for traditional traders 
While some commercial banks currently offer loans for traders, the interest is high and the requirements are difficult for traditional traders to fulfill
Local governments, through the OMM, should ensure that traditional traders have access to microfinance options, to enable them to expand their business
5 Thorough Regulation of Modern Markets 
National and local governments must have control mechanisms and monitoring systems in place to ensure fairer competition amongst traditional and modern retailers
Regulation of modern markets should cover such issues as the rights and responsibilities of modern market operators and the local administration, and also sanctions for breaching the regulations
While some administrations may deem it necessary to have a separate by law, the improvement of the current by law should be sufficient
ABSTRACT
Implementation of the 2007 Certification Program for Practicing Teachers
A Case Study of Jambi, West Java, and West Kalimantan Provinces
The teacher certification program for practicing teachers has been implemented since 2007 as an effort to set standards and increase the quality of teachers
Teacher certification was carried out through portfolio assessments for civil servant and non-civil servant teachers with a minimal educational background of an undergraduate degree or four-year diploma, who teach in preschools, primary schools, junior high schools, and senior high schools
Teachers deemed to pass will receive an teaching certificate, teacher registration number, and professional allowance to the value of one month's basic wage
In order to understand the 2007 teacher certification implementation process, and as lessons learned for the improvement in program implementation, in 2008 The SMERU Research Institute conducted a study of teacher certification in six kabupaten (districts)/kota (cities) in three provinces
The research uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods
In general the results indicate that implementation of teacher certification has had several weaknesses
There are still obstacles in horizontal coordination between institutions, socialization of the program varies, and the information disseminated has not been complete;
The total quota between study areas was not proportional to the number of teachers who fulfilled the conditions;
In a limited number of cases there are indications of deception in the determination of participants;
There were reports of deception in the compilation of portfolios;
Participants who passed have not received registration numbers and only a few have received teaching certificates;
and payment of the professional allowance has been held up
Certification's impact on increasing the quality of teachers is still in question
However, the program encourages teachers to actively pursue various activities and teachers who do not yet fulfill the criteria are encouraged to increase their education to the undergraduate degree level
Key words
teacher certification, program evaluation, program impacts
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Introduction
In an effort to set standards and increase the quality of teachers, from 2007 the Ministry of National Education (MoNE or Departemen Pendidikan Nasional/Depdiknas) has implemented a teacher certification program for practicing teachers
It is hoped that teacher certification will improve the quality of teachers, and therefore the quality of learning, and finally improve the quality of education in a holistic and ongoing manner
Teacher certification is implemented through a portfolio assessment for teachers who have, as a minimum, an undergraduate degree (S1) or four-year diploma (D4), and includes both civil servants and non-civil servants in public and private pre-schools, primary, junior high and senior high schools
Teachers deemed to pass, either directly through portfolio assessment or after undertaking a remedial training course (PLPG), receive a certificate, teacher registration number, and a professional allowance to the value of one month's wage
In 2007 certification was undertaken for 225,211 target teachers, 200,450 through MoNE and 24,761 through the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MoRA or Departemen Agama/Depag)
In order to understand the implementation of the program, the SMERU Research Institute undertook a study of the 2007 teacher certification program in May-July 2008, at the request of MoNE, the World Bank Office Jakarta, and Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT University), and the Directorate General of Higher Education (Ditjen Dikti) in MoNE
The study aims to understand the stages in the 2007 certification implementation process, as well as the general perceptions of teachers and other relevant parties of the influence of certification on the quality of teachers and learning
This study used a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods and was conducted in six kabupaten/kota (districts/cities) in three provinces
Kabupaten Muara Jambi and Kota Jambi in Jambi province; Kabupaten Majalengka and Kota Bekasi in West Java Province; and Kabupaten Melawi and Kota Singkawang in West Kalimantan Province
The results of the field study are as follows
Findings Implementing Organizations
The implementation of teacher certification through the two institutional channels, MoNE and MoRA, is in accordance with the regulations and competencies of the each institution
However, as implementation is not accompanied by the provision of clear and complete information, the division of certification through these two channels has created problems, including situations where teachers have been asked to undertake certification through both organizations or by the wrong organization
Generally LPTKs have undertaken certification activities as per the regulations
However, in terms of timing, implementation has been delayed
At June 2008 only the LPTK in West Kalimantan had provided certificates to teachers who passed
This delay appears to have occurred because of the influence of the double functions performed by sections of the LPTK, where committee members doubled as assessors and remedial training instructors
Socialization MoNE and MoRA conducted formal socialization through meetings for program implementers at various levels of government as well as for teachers participating in certification
Socialization for implementing agencies was sufficient in terms of quantity, but needed improvement in quality
MoNE and MoRA kabupaten (district)/kota (city) offices should form the spearhead for the implementation of socialization for schools and teachers in their jurisdictions
However, because the program did not provide funds specifically for socialization, formal socialization by these organizations varied between study areas
A lack of funds also affected the distribution of the certification guidebook for teachers, or its photocopies, to participants
As a means of socialization, the government also provided information through the teacher certification website
However, the number of participant and non-participant teachers which access the website is still very low due to limited facilities and technical skills
In general, after certification implementation entered its second year participants' understanding of certification was relatively good, although their knowledge was incomplete
A large proportion of teachers did not know which year's basic wage the professional allowance would be based on, and when and how it would be paid
Non-participants' understanding of certification was also good, though limited to the general participant requirements, the compilation of the portfolio, and the existence of the professional allowance
Determination of the Quotas The 2007 quota was set three times; first based on the original 2006 quota, then on a new 2007 quota, and finally, an additional 2007 quota
The process of setting the MoNE quota changed
For the determination of the 2006 and 2007 quota, the MoNE set the quotas right down to the kabupaten/kota level
Meanwhile, for the additional 2007 quota and the 2008 quota, the MoNE only set a provincial quota, and the provinces set the quotas for the kabupaten/kota level
In 2007 certification kabupaten/kota agencies were only able to distribute the quota between the different levels of education
However, in 2008 they were also able to distribute the quota between civil servant and non-civil servant groups
The basis of the determination of quotas also changed
In 2007 certification the provincial and kabupaten/kota quotas were based on the total number of teachers in each region
In 2008 certification the provincial quota was based on the total number of teachers while the kabupaten/kota quotas were based on the total number of teachers with an undergraduate degree/four-year diploma
In the study areas, the quotas were determined according to these rules
The exception was the additional 2007 quota for Jambi, which was evenly divided between kabupaten/kota
In West Java, the division of the 2008 quota for the kabupaten/kota was based on the total number of teachers with undergraduate degrees/four-year diplomas who had a Unique Teacher and Education Staff Identification Number (nomor unik pendidik dan tenaga kependidikan, or NUPTK)
The total 2007 certification quota varied between provinces and kabupaten/kota in the study areas
In comparison to the total number of teachers fulfilling the criteria, there were kabupaten/kota with excesses or shortages in their quotas
This was due to the uneven or limited number of teachers with undergraduate degrees/diplomas in certain regions, the inaccuracy of the data used, and a difference in the determination of quotas based on the total number of teachers and the determination of participants based on the requirement of having an undergraduate degree/diploma
Unlike MoNE, MoRA's quotas were determined centrally
In general MoRA kabupaten/kota offices and religion teachers thought that the quota MoRA received was too small
However, in general teachers also thought that the distribution of total participants between schools was relatively fair and in line with the total number of teachers with undergraduate degrees and the length of their teaching experience
Determination of Participants In the study areas, the kabupaten/kota education office chose and determined participants by applying the requirements of having an undergraduate degree or four-year diploma, using a set order of criteria, and setting the length of teaching experience as the most important criteria
However, despite this in a limited number of cases there is an indication of inconsistencies/unfairness in the determination of participants
For example, determination of participants was not transparent, there were participants who had less work experience than those who were not chosen to become participants, and there were participants who had approached and developed a good relationship with the kabupaten/kota education office
MoRA participants were determined at the central level, and participants were chosen from a list of teachers who had registered based on the set criteria
MoRA kabupaten/kota offices had differing views of this method of determining participants
Some offices agreed with it because it meant that they were free of the responsibility themselves, but others did not agree with the process because they thought it was not transparent, felt that they had no authority, and were unable to provide explanations if there were teachers who complained
Meanwhile, teachers in the study areas thought that it was not transparent, especially because there were participants who were younger or had less work experience than teachers who were not chosen to participate
In all the study areas, the quota received was not filled
The number of portfolios assessed by LPTKs only filled 55%-96% of the total quota received by the respective regions
Kabupaten/kota in Java and urban areas outside of Java filled their quotas to higher levels, ranging between 89%-96%, while kabupaten outside of Java only filled the quotas to around 55%
This may be due to differences in the ease of information transfers, the availability and completeness of teachers' data, and the number of the teachers fulfilling the requirements
Compilation of the Portfolios Although a guidebook for teachers was supplied, because the portfolio was something new, and in several regions was not accompanied by integrated socialization, many participants did not fully understand the technical aspects of the portfolio compilation
In addition, many participants faced technical obstacles in collecting very old documents, and in making lesson plans (RPP)
Other obstacles were the limited time provided to compile the portfolio, teachers having only a limited number of training and seminar certificates, and limited means of arranging for the portfolio to be typed
In some areas there were reports of deception in the compilation of the portfolios, including falsified seminar/training/competition certificates and plagiarized lesson plans
In 2008 certification, participants had to provide original documents relating to the education, training and participation in scientific forums components, so deception was more easily prevented
In making their portfolios, participants spent between Rp100,000 and Rp500,000, and there were even participants who spend more than Rp1 million
This covered costs such as typing services, photocopying documents, copies of portfolios, verifying documents, tokens of appreciation for staff/officials who assessed the portfolios, and portfolio compilation advice
Portfolio Assessment The percentage of participants who passed directly from portfolio assessment was relatively low and varied between areas
In Jambi 30% of 2,249 participants, in West Java 47% of 16,817 participants, and in West Kalimantan 19% of 2,818 participants passed directly through portfolio assessment
The difference in the pass rates between sample kabupaten/kota is quite large, with the lowest pass rate in Melawi, West Kalimantan, at 8%, and the highest in Majalengka, West Java, at 61%
Based on a comparison of the scores of 31 sample portfolios from the LPTK in Jambi, which were reassessed by the LPTK in West Java, it can be seen that in general the assessment scores given by the LPTK in Jambi were higher, and the scores given by the two LPTKs were not very consistent
This shows the high level of subjectivity in the LPTKs assessment of portfolios
Despite this, there is no indication of deception in portfolio assessment
Generally informants thought that LPTKs' assessments of the portfolios were accurate and in line with the guidebook
In addition, participants did not know who assessed their portfolios
Remedial Training (PLPG) & Passing Rates Participants thought that the remedial training course was very beneficial because they gained knowledge and new skills related to the teaching and learning process
Participants thought that the course material provided was relevant and not too difficult because it related to things they did as teachers
Participants also thought that the instructors were very competent both in their mastery of the material as well as in its delivery; moreover many had doctorate degrees and were even professors
In the study areas the percentage of remedial training candidates in 2007 was quite high relative to the number of participants who submitted portfolios, at 37%-90%
This condition has drawn suspicion that LPTKs deliberately failed participants so that they undertook the remedial training, which attracted a fairly high budget per participant
Generally remedial training participants were deemed to pass and only a small number of participants needed to take the repeat examination
This meant that all 2007 certification participants were deemed to pass, except those who were deemed not to qualify because they did not fulfill the participant requirements, did not submit portfolios, or did not take the remedial training course
Because of this, information spread that eventually, all certification participants who fulfilled the participant requirements would pass, and it was only the stage at which they passed which would differ
According to the rules, participants who pass will receive a teaching certificate from the LPTK and a teacher registration number from MoNE
However, at the time this study was conducted all participants who had passed had not received a teacher registration number and all participants, except some participants in West Kalimantan, had not yet received teaching certificates
Professional Allowance
Participants who pass will receive a professional allowance
The rules about when the allowance would be paid differed between certification in 2007 and 2008
In 2007, participants who passed before October 2007 would receive the professional allowance from 1 October 2007, while participants who passed after this date would receive the allowance starting from the month after they were deemed to pass
In 2008 the professional allowance was provided from January of the financial year following the year they passed and received their teacher certificate and registration number
The payment of the professional allowance was held up
Most MoNE participants and a small proportion of non-civil servant Islamic school teachers from the 2006 quota who passed have received the allowance
However, they only received the allowance for the first quarter (October-December 2007), which was paid in January 2008
They did not receive the allowance from February 2008, even though they should have received payments twice for the January-June 2008 allowance
At the time this study was conducted, it was not certain when the professional allowance would be paid
Funding
The certification program is funded through the central and regional government budgets, and other official sources
The central government budget supplied funds for LPTKs' certification activities and the payment of the professional allowance
The regional government budgets also fund certification activities related to the tasks and role of the provincial and kabupaten/kota agencies
In 2007 certification, funds from the central government budget were managed by MoNE and MoRA at the central level
But, in 2008 certification were decentralized to the provinces through deconcentration funds
To implement certification, the GoI provided LPTKs with a budget of Rp2 million per participant, with Rp500,000 allocated to portfolio assessment and Rp1.5 million for remedial training
Actual spending on portfolio assessment per participant was slightly lower than planned, at Rp407,000-Rp494,000
Actual spending on remedial training activities was quite high, at Rp2 million per participant in Jambi, and Rp3 million per participant in West Java and West Kalimantan
In 2007 certification not all regional governments provided a sufficient APBD budget, so not all regions were able to conduct all activities, like socialization, consultancy services, and distribution of portfolios, in full
Because of this, the implementing agencies in several regions picked up costs from participants such as for participating in additional socialization activities, sending the portfolios to the LPTKs, and organizing documents for the professional allowance
Coordination, Complaints, and Monitoring and Evaluation In the study areas vertical coordination between implementing organizations occurred quite well, although there were several problems, particularly relating to data, policy, and shortcuts in coordination channels
Horizontal coordination generally faced more obstacles because it involved different agencies
As an information service and means of accountability, MoNE opened a community services unit (UPM), which was located in Jakarta
The existence of this unit was only communicated in the guidebook provided for implementing organizations, and not in the guidebook for participants
Because of this, teachers generally did not know that the UPM existed and information about irregularities/inconsistence circulated among teachers and related institutions without any formal complaints
Throughout certification implementation only the LPTKs were visited by a monitoring and evaluation (monev) team
The 2007 guidebooks only cover monev activities in a general way, and is limited to the determination of certification participants
The 2008 guidebooks deal with monev activities more broadly, 
However, as a non-binding proposal only, in a very general way and they are not specific about how the monev activities would work and be funded, so its implementation is questionable
The 2008 guidebooks also mention a monitoring system for participants who receive the professional allowance
However, the monitoring system only covers data relating to employment status and working hours, and does not cover the elements assessed in certification such as teachers' quality and competence
Impacts of the Program
The impact of certification on increasing the quality of teachers is still questionable
Some informants felt that an increase in welfare may increase the quality of teachers because teachers would be more motivated and be able to better concentrate
However, others were not certain because they thought that an increase in quality and performance is a matter of personal commitment
It is also questionable that the implementation of certification will increase teacher quality because there is no mechanism to identify the best teachers
With the exception of a small proportion of the additional 2007 quota, the assessment only covered pre-existing administrative documents
There was also a lot of deception found in the compilations of portfolios
The potential impact of the program on teachers who have not yet undertaken certification is quite large
Teachers who have not fulfilled the requirement of having an undergraduate degree have been encouraged to continue their studies
Teachers have also been encouraged to actively participate in various activities in order to obtain certificates for their portfolios
In the long run, one of the benefits of the teacher certification program is the attraction of welleducated, high-quality human resources into the teaching profession
Teacher certification has also had other positive and negative impacts
Certification provided opportunities for lecturers to become committee members, assessors or remedial training instructors which provided additional income
Various institutions were encouraged to hold commercial seminars, with other parties as speakers
Certification has also given rise to the emergence of document and portfolio compilation services
The requirement to teach 24 hours per week has made many teachers seek additional teaching hours in their schools or in other schools
Certification can also cause jealousy among teachers
Recommendations
Based on the field findings above, the following are several policy recommendations to improve the implementation of the certification program
1. There needs to be a wider distribution of clear and consistent information about the division of authority between MoNE and MoRA, both for implementing organizations as well as teachers
This must be supported by good coordination and the two organizations should use similar standards in implementing the program, especially in the determination of participants
2. Socialization for participants needs to be done at the lower government level, at the kabupaten/kota level as a minimum
Socialization needs to consider the total number of participants so that information dissemination is more effective and does not burden participants
The information disseminated should at least cover participant requirements and criteria, the method of compiling and assessing portfolios, and the procedure for the payment of the professional allowance
3. Certification information should be given to non-participant teachers so that they have the same knowledge and perceptions of certification, and are encouraged to add to their qualifications
This can also reduce the possibility of jealousy between teachers
The general community also needs to obtain information so that people are more interested in the teaching profession
This can be done through the distribution of brochures and mass media advertising
The teacher certification website must also be widely publicized and provide more complete information
4. Transparency needs to be improved in several phases of the certification process
The determination of the kabupaten/kota quotas at the provincial level requires a transparent control mechanism and greater involvement of kabupaten/kota education offices to mitigate the risk of deception at the provincial level
5. To maintain objectivity in the determination of participants, the selection criteria must be transparent and the ranked list of teachers who fulfill the criteria should be easily accessed by teachers, for example, displayed on information boards of agencies at the kabupaten/kota and kecamatan (subdistrict) levels
6. The provision of authority to the kabupaten/kota education office to distribute the quota between civil servant and non-civil servant teachers should be followed by requirements which guarantee transparency and objectivity to mitigate the risk of deception
7. To avoid unfilled quotas, participants need to be given enough time (at least two weeks) to arrange their portfolios
8. The use of Unique Teacher and Education Staff Identification Number (NUPTK) data as the basis for determining the quotas and participants is still preemptive as there are many teachers who fulfill the participant requirements but who do not yet have NUPTKs
To avoid such cases of unfairness, the use of NUPTK data should not be forced before all teachers, or as a minimum, those who fulfill the participant criteria, have a NUPTK
9. Stricter and more detailed assessment standards must be set for portfolio components so as to reduce the subjectivity of the assessors
The average results for each portfolio component should be made available in a transparent and easily accessible way to participant teachers, both through announcements on the website as well as through circulars to agencies at the kabupaten/kota level
10. The weightings of the respective components also needs to be reconsidered so that greater value is placed on teacher performance, such as by increasing the weighting of the professional development component, not prioritizing documents which are formalities, and not allowing participants with low scores to automatically take the remedial training
11. There needs to be a longer, more intensive form of training with more in-depth material to ensure the quality of participants who take the PLPG
The assessment of whether participants pass must be performed objectively, using strict pass levels, and participants who do not pass should not automatically become certification participants the following year
12. There needs a mechanism which can ensure the punctuality of payment of the professional allowance, which can be supported by a number of things, including the provision of procedures for the administration of the payment which are simple, practical and which can guarantee the accuracy of recipients' data
13. Control mechanisms for certification implementation must be optimized, including by having existing monitoring institutions, implementing institutions, and independent institutions conduct staged monitoring
The existence of a complaints body should be communicated widely and at the various government levels, with a clear complaints resolution mechanism
In addition, there must be strict sanctions for the various forms of deception which occur
14. To better ensure that the objective of certification, to increase the quality of teachers and education, is met, the performance of teachers who pass certification should be assessed periodically based on their pedagogical, professional, personal, and social skills
15. Committee members should not have dual roles as assesors or instructurs because committee members perform routine tasks and have rather heavy workloads
This needs to be supported by the provision of incentives for committee members equal to the incentives for assessors and instructors
I INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
Law No 20, 2003 on the National Education System, Law No 14, 2005 on Teachers and Lecturers, and Government Regulation No 19, 2005 on National Education Standards decree that teachers are professional educators
Professional educators must have academic qualifications and competencies as agents of learning and physical and spiritual health, as well as the ability to realize national education targets
In an effort to establish standards and raise the quality of teachers, the Government of Indonesia (GoI), through the Ministry of National Education (MoNE or Departemen Pendidikan Nasional/Depdiknas), has implemented a Teacher Certification Program from 2007
The implementation of this program is accompanied by the provision of a professional allowance equivalent to one month's base wage (gaji pokok) to improve teacher wealth, increase the appeal of the teaching profession, and provide strong encouragement for teachers to participate in the certification process
It is hoped that teacher certification will increase the quality of teachers, which will then increase the quality of learning, and finally improve the quality of education as a whole and in a continuing way
Teacher certification involves the provision of teacher certificates to teachers
In accordance with the Minister of National Education Regulation No 18, 2007, certification in 2007 was carried out through an assessment of a portfolio containing ten components reflecting four teacher competencies, that is pedagogical, professional, personal, and social capabilities
Meanwhile certification in 2008, aside from operating through a portfolio assessment, was also carried out via an education channel in accordance with Ministerial Regulation No 40, 2007
Teacher certification is implemented through two organizations, MoNE and the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MoRA, or Departemen Agama/Depag)
MoNE handles certification for teachers from public schools, other than religion teachers, while MoRA handles certification for teachers from Islamic schools (madrasah) and religion teachers in public schools
In account of the total number of teachers and the annual quotas it obtained, MoNE aims to complete teacher certification by 2015, while MoRA has a target of 2011 for Islamic school teachers, and 2013 for Islamic education teachers (PAI)
The certification service providers are higher education institutes which have programs for the training of education staff, or institutions for the education of teaching staff (LPTKs), which are accredited and maintained by the Government of Indonesia through MoNE
Certification participants are teachers who fulfill the minimal qualification requirement of an undergraduate degree (S1) or four-year diploma (D4), and include both civil servants and non-civil servants in public and private pre-schools, primary, junior high, and senior high schools
Aware of the quota in the number of teachers able to participate in certification relative to the total number of teachers, MoNE at the kabupaten/kota (district/city) level and MoRA rank participants based on a set of ordered criteria
Teachers chosen present a portfolio as well as physical proof of their work achievements, which are assessed by LPTK using standard mechanisms
Teachers declared to pass the portfolio assessment receive a certificate and teacher registration number, along with the professional allowance
Teachers who do not pass must complete their portfolios or undertake teaching education and training (PLPG)
PLPG ends with an examination, and teachers who do not pass this examination are given the opportunity to repeat it twice
In 2007 31 LPTKs implemented teacher certification for general teachers and 16 LPTKs implemented certification for religion teachers spread across Indonesia
The target was 225,211 teachers, consisting of 200,450 teachers certified through MoNE and 24,761 through MoRA
For 2008, the GoI has determined a certification target through portfolio assessment of 247,000 teachers, consisting of 200,000 teachers certified through MoNE and 47,000 through MoRA
In order to understand the implementation of the program, the Directorate General of Higher Education in MoNE, the World Bank, and Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT University) has asked The SMERU Research Institute to undertake a study of the implementation of the teacher certification program in 2007
This study is intended to support and provide broader, more detailed input into previous and future studies on certification
Although this study was conducted in a limited number of sample areas, and does not provide a picture of certification in Indonesia as a whole, it is hoped that its results can provide input into the improvement of the program's implementation in years to come
1.2 Objectives
In a general sense this study aims to understand the various stages in the implementation of teacher certification in 2007, starting from the determination of the quota and selection of participants, assessment of portfolios, and implementation of PLPG, to the payment of the professional allowance to participating teachers who pass
It is hoped that through this study it can be determined whether teacher certification has been implemented in accordance with the regulations or have there been adjustments
This study also aims to reveal the general perception of teachers and relevant parties on the impact of certification on the quality of teachers and the learning process
Specifically, this study aims to answer the following questions
a) Did teachers understand the stipulations that govern the certification process, and what did they think of these stipulations
b) How were certification participants selected
c) Was portfolio assessment able to identify the best teachers
d) Were portfolios assessed consistently
e) Is there any indication of any irregularities/inconsistencies/unfairness in the determination of the participants who passed the portfolio assessment
f) How was the remedial training run and what did teachers think of the training material
g) Were standards for the remedial training examinations the same across LPTKs
h) Was there any indication of irregularities/inconsistencies/unfairness in the determination of whether participants passed the remedial training exam
At the time this study was conducted, the implementation of certification in 2008 had already commenced
Because of this it is hoped that this study can provide a general picture of the start of the implementation of teacher certification in 2008, and a comparison with certification in 2007
1.3 Methodology
This study uses a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods
Information relating to 2007 implementation was collected qualitatively in every study area through in-depth interviews, using the same probing questions
In addition to this, the research team also collected secondary data from LPTKs, MoNE, MoRA, and kabupaten/kota education and MoRA offices
Information collected from detailed interviews was analyzed qualitatively, while secondary data was analyzed in a simple quantitative way
Field trips were undertaken in three randomly selected provinces covering Java, Sumatra, and Kalimantan-Sulawesi-Nusa Tenggara
From these provinces two kabupaten/kota were selected at random so that in total there were six study samples
Kabupaten Muara Jambi and Kota Jambi in Jambi Province; Majalengka and Kota Bekasi in West Java Province; and Kabupaten Melawi and Kota Singakawang in West Kalimantan Province
Before conducting the field trip, the research team held discussions with MoNE, MoRA and the Independent Team from the Consortium for Teacher Certification, from MoNE (Tim Independen Konsorsium Sertifikasi Guru Depdiknas) to obtain a general picture of the program's implementation
In addition to this the research team also conducted a literature study of the program's implementation guidelines, reports on research findings, and various articles relating to teacher certification
At the provincial level the research team visited LPTKs, the education office, and MoRA provincial office
At the kabupaten/kota level the team visited the education office including the Education Office Technical Implementation Unit (UPTD) in the kecamatan, MoRA kabupaten/kota office, Education Boards, the Teachers' Association of the Republic of Indonesia (PGRI), and NGOs concerned with education and schools
In the LPTKs, the research team interviewed a minimum of five sources
the head of the certification committee, who had access to files across the portfolio which was assessed; two committee members who manage the administration of certification; and two assessors who conduct portfolio assessments, but who are not involved in the administration
In all of the LPTKs, the team collected data on portfolio assessment results across participants, assessment results from the two assessors and their average scores, and scores from the PLPG examination
In the LPTK in Jambi (the University of Jambi-Unja) the research team also collected 60 teacher portfolios which had already been assessed, consisting of three groups of randomly selected teachers, primary school teachers, junior high school mathematics teachers, and junior high school Indonesian teachers
Photocopies of the 60 portfolios were sent to the LPTK in West Java for reassessment to check for consistency in grading procedures at different LPTKs
In the kabupaten/kota education office the research team interviewed at least one person in charge of the certification process in order to understand the dissemination of information, the participant selection process, communication and coordination between the education office and other parties, including with school principals/teachers, and implementation problems
The same was done in MoRA's provincial and kabupaten/kota offices
In each sample kabupaten/kota the research team visited four schools, comprising of public senior high and vocational schools, public junior high schools, public primary schools and Islamic schools (primary or junior high Islamic schools)
These schools were selected from a list of schools with teachers who had participated in certification in 2007
Public senior high and vocational schools were randomly selected, while other schools were selected purposively requiring that they represented the schools in closest proximity to the chosen public high school or vocational school
Overall, the team visited a total of 24 schools consisting of 6 public senior high and vocational schools, 6 public junior high schools, 6 primary schools, 3 Islamic senior high schools (madrasah sanawiah), and 3 Islamic junior high schools (madrasah ibtidaiah)
In each school, the research team interviewed the school principal, four teachers who had participated in certification in 2007, who if possible had passed in varying ways (such as through portfolio assessment, by providing missing portfolio documents, or by undertaking PLPG), and two current 2008 certification participants or teachers who had not yet participated
The research team also interviewed teachers outside the chosen schools in order to gain a different perspective and more complete information about certification
Due to time limitations and the available resources, and in accordance with the proportion of the quota each organization received, the majority of informants interviewed in this study undertook certification through MoNE
Only LPTKs certifying teachers of general studies were interviewed, and of the 24 schools visited, 18 were public schools and 6 were Islamic schools
Because of this, for the implementation of certification through MoRA, this study focuses more on uncovering qualitative information directly related to participants
1.4 Report Structure
This research report is divided into four sections
The first chapter is an introduction, outlining the background and aims of the study and the methodology used
The second chapter outlines the findings of the study and explains the institutions, distribution of information, determination of the quota, determination of participating teachers, portfolio collection and assessment, PLPG activities, rate at which participants pass, payment system, communications system, and monitoring and evaluation
The third chapter outlines perceptions of the impact of the program on increasing teachers' welfare, the quality of teachers and the general quality of education
The fourth chapter is the closing chapter, and provides recommendations for the improvement of the program in the future
II PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
2.1 Implementing Organizations
2.1.1 Government Organizations
In accordance with Law No 20, 2003 on the National Education System, the coordination and supervision of primary and intermediate education in Indonesia is conducted by MoNE or MoRa
This stipulation also applies to the teacher certification program
The implementation of teacher certification through two different channels involves various government agencies from the central government level to the kabupaten/kota level
At the central government level, certification through MoNE involves the Directorate General of Higher Education (Ditjen Dikti) and the Directorate General for the Improvement in the Quality of Teachers and Education Staff (Directorate General for PMPTK) in MoNE
At the provincial level, certification involves the provincial education office and the Lembaga Penjaminan Mutu Pendidikan (LPMP), or Institute for Education Quality Assurance), while at the kabupaten/kota level it involves the local education office
Certification through MoRA involves several directorates under the Directorate General for Islamic Education
The Directorate of Islamic Schools handles certification for Islamic school teachers, the Directorate of Islamic Education Teachers handles certification for Islamic education teachers, and the Directorate of Religious and Islamic Boarding Schools handles certification for teachers in Islamic boarding schools
Implementation at the provincial level involves MoRA's provincial office, and at the kabupaten/kota level, its kabupaten/kota office
MoRA also engages three universities, the State Islamic University in Riau, IAIN Semarang and the State Islamic University Makassar, to process registration data for certification candidates from Islamic schools
A Consortium for Teacher Certification (KSG) was formed to coordinate implementation at the central level, comprising of the Directorate General of Higher Education, the Directorate General for PMPTK, MoRA and LPTKs
These institutions were, amongst other things, tasked with standardizing processes and results, undertaking policy harmonization and synchronization and coordinating the implementation of monitoring and evaluation
At the provincial level, the role of the education office and LPMP increased during certification in 2007 and 2008
While the provincial education office previously had a role in socialization, communication, and coordination activities as well as monitoring and evaluation, from the determination of the additional 2007 quota it also had a role in determining the kabupaten/kota quotas
Moreover, since 2008 the provincial education office has also had a role in processing and distributing the professional allowance for teachers who had passed certification
From 2008 LPMP, which previously only had a role in processing A2 forms with participants' personal information, has also has a role in socialization, arranging and determining the spread of participants across kabupaten/kota, and determining the kabupaten/kota quotas
Meanwhile, the role of MoRA's provincial office did not change and was more limited to socialization activities, communication and coordination, and monitoring and evaluation
The exception to this was West Kalimantan, where the MoRA provincial office also had a role in sending participants' data and collecting and sending portfolios to the LPTKs
At the kabupaten/kota level, the education office had a role in socialization, choosing participants, collecting and sending portfolios to the LPTKs, announcing LPTK results, and coordinating activities with the provincial education office, LPMP, and the LPTKs
On the other hand, the MoRA kabupaten/kota office only had a role in data collection for registered potential candidates, collection, and sending of portfolios to the LPTKs, and the delivery of LPTK assessment results
In West Kalimantan, however, the role of collecting and sending portfolios has shifted to the MoRA provincial office
The division of certification through these two institutional avenues highlights the difficulty in implementation
Implementation was not accompanied by the provision of clear and complete information for both implementing institutions and participating teachers
Moreover, there are teachers whose wage payments and personnel arrangements have until now been under the administration of MoNE, but who were required to be certified through MoRA
Difficulties have also arisen due to institutional ego
One problem that has been found is that some teachers were asked to undertake certification through both institutions or the wrong institution
The teachers involved in these cases were generally teachers of religion or teachers with a religion studies background in public schools who have a Civil Servant Identification number (NIP) with a 13 prefix, usually referred to as NIP 13 teachers
Even those NIP 13 teachers deemed to have passed certification did not clearly understand which organization will arrange the payment of their professional allowances
In some of the study areas there were cases of NIP 13 teachers who were asked to undertake certification through the education office
In Kota Jambi, 70 NIP 13 teachers submitted portfolios to the education office, but the portfolios were not processed, and sent to the MoRA kabupaten/kota office
Some of these teachers were able to continue the certification process only because they were included as Ministry of Religious Affairs certification participants by chance
In another case in Majalengka, West Java, a teacher undertaking certification through MoRA was asked to return to the education office
During 2008 certification the education office in Singkawang, West Kalimantan, asked teachers of general studies in an Islamic school to be certified through MoNE
These teachers have already submitted their portfolios
Some education offices believed that these problems arose because the MoRA kabupaten/kota offices do not perform their tasks correctly, and many religion teachers in public schools are not registered
MoRA's kabupaten/kota offices denied this, because they have already provided all religion teachers in public schools with blank forms
But, many religion teachers with NIP- 13s did not return their forms to MoRA because they said they are civil servants from the education office, not MoRA
Other problems relate to the internal conditions of the kabupaten/kota education offices as certification technical implementation units
In a large proportion of sample kabupaten/kota, staff handling certification were transferred to other areas without a comprehensive handover of data and information to new staff
Consequently, new staff did not fully understand the mechanisms, data, and information relating to certification implementation
2.1.2 Certifying Organizations
Teacher certification was implemented by higher education institutions which run programs providing teaching qualifications, or LPTKs, which were accredited and determined by MoNE
In order to become a certification implementer LPTKs fulfilling the requirements were required to put forward a proposal to MoNE for assessment
During certification implementation in 2007, of the approximately 200 LPTK which registered, 31 LPTKs were determined to be parent' implementers, 61 LPTKs partner implementers for teachers of general studies, and 16 parent and 18 partner LPTKs for the certification of religion teachers across Indonesia
The division of LPTK work areas/units was determined by MoNE
Each LPTK area consists of one parent and zero to seven partner LPTKs
For certification of general studies teachers, the Jambi implementation unit consisted of a parent LPTK and one partner LPTK, the West Java unit consisted of one parent and seven partner LPTKs, while the West Kalimantan unit only had one parent LPTK
For certification of religion teachers, in West Java a partner LPTK helped a parent LPTK, in Jambi there was only a partner organization which supported the LPTK in Padang, while in West Kalimantan there was no LPTK and certification was done by a LPTK in Jakarta (see Table 1)
The scope of the respective work areas was limited by kabupaten/kota areas
A LPTK for general studies in a particular area could cover part or all of a kabupaten/kota in one or several provinces
In the study areas the scope of certification for general studies teachers varied slightly
Area 10 in West Java covered almost all the kabupaten/kota in the province except Kabupaten Bogor, Kota Bogor, and Depok
However, Area 8 in Jambi and Area 20 in West Kalimantan covered all the kabupaten/kota in their respective provinces
Meanwhile the scope of LPTKs for religion studies was wider because of the limited number of certification participants
A large proportion of these LPTKs covered several provinces, and there were even LPTKs which covered an entire region of Indonesia who have between them certified Catholic, Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu religion teachers
The following analysis is specific to LPTK which certified teachers of general studies
According to the stipulations, parent and partner LPTKs must form a certification committee together
However, there is information that partner LPTKs are less involved
Some LPTKs felt that they were not given a role even in the implementation of the various certification activities
Because of this partner LPTKs across Indonesia put forward a recommendation to MoNE for the division of work between parent and partner LPTKs
This recommendation has not been acted upon, with the cited reason being that 2008 certification is already underway
The composition of each LPTK committee in the study areas varied but as a minimum there was a unit/area head and deputy head, expert staff, head of operations, secretary, treasurer, and divisions (see Table 2)
The total number of people involved in the committee also varied
All members came from parent and partner LPTKs, except in West Kalimantan in which there was no partner LPTK
The proportions of total committee members from parent and partner LPTKs appear uneven
In Jambi, only 3 of 23 committee members were from partner LPTKs
In West Java, the balance between area managers and expert staff was even, however, the implementation/operational section was dominated by staff from the parent LPTK
All divisions were chaired by the parent LPTK
Even three of five divisions were even comprised solely of representatives from the parent LPTK
Based on their set role, the LPTKs performed all tasks associated with portfolio assessment, running the remedial training course, determining which participants pass, and providing certificates for teachers who have passed certification
For portfolio assessment activities, LPTKs acted as a planner and coordinator, while assessment was done by assessors
The LPTKs recruited instructors to provide material for the remedial training
In general, qualifications required of assessors and instructors were the same
Assessors and instructors needed to be university lecturers with at least a masters degree, with either their undergraduate or masters degree in Education, or a teaching diploma (Akta V) or applied approach certificate
Instructors were also required to have at least ten years' teaching experience
In addition, instructur need to be nominated by the study program in which they taught
In a case in West Kalimantan, an instructor had only an undergraduate degree because of the limited number of lecturers in the relevant subject area and he had been judged as already being of a senior level
In Jambi, a proportion of instructors doubled as committee members and all instructors were also assessors
In West Java and West Kalimantan, a small proportion of instructors were also committee members, and a large proportion were assessors
Unlike the recruitment of instructors, for the recruitment of assessors the committee only had a role in recruiting assessors selected by MoNE
LPTKs did not experience difficulty in recruiting potential assessors because there were enough lecturers who fulfilled the criteria, and many were interested in becoming assessors, mainly because of the incentive that was offered
Assessors received Rp150,000, or Rp127,500 after tax, for each portfolio they assessed
Assessors would receive Rp1,275,000 in a day if they could assess ten portfolios
This figure does not include payments for transport, food, and accommodation
A team from MoNE ran the assessor selection process in the LPTKs over two days
On the first day candidates received socialization about certification and portfolio assessment
The following day candidates took a portfolio assessment examination, with the results assessed in Jakarta
Candidates deemed to pass were appointed through a letter of authority from the Director General of Higher Education and given Chief Assessor Numbers (Nomor Induk Assessor, or NIA)
The names of the assessors were only given to the parent LPTK, which then informed the relevant assessors, partner LPTKs, and the respective assessors' faculty heads
In order to maintain the independence of the assessors, the LPTK did not announce the names of assessors to other parties, including the education office
However, this effort was not flawless because the names of the respective LPTK assessors can be found on the teacher certification website
The number of assessors in the study areas varied according to the number of certification participants
In 2007 there were 87 assessors in Jambi, 461 assessors in West Java, and 92 assessors in West Kalimantan
For 2008 certification the total number of assessors will be increased
At the time of the field visit a recruitment exercise had already been completed, however, not all the decisions had been made
Jambi received an additional 37 assessors, in West Java there are 451 assessor candidates, and West Kalimantan has received an additional 40 assessors and 10 assessor candidates
In 2007 certification, all assessors came from the respective LPTKs
However, for certification in 2008 some assessors or assessor candidates came from civil servant training and education institutes (widyaiswara) LPMP and the Centre for the Development and Strengthening of Educators and Education Staff (P4TK)
As a proportion of the total number of assessors, parent LPTKs were fairly dominant
In Jambi 113 (91%) of 124 assessors, in West Java 383 (83%) of 461 assessors, and 340 (78%) of 451 assessor candidates
Although this was the case informants from partner LPTKs in West Java did not make an issue of it because it was in line with the resources each organization had which fulfilled the criteria
In Jambi and West Java, all members of the implementing committee were also assessors, except for those with undergraduate degrees only
Meanwhile in West Kalimantan the head of the LPTK did not allow committees members to double as assessors, because the committee workload was so heavy that it would affect work performance
Because there is a bigger incentive for assessors, in 2008 certification two committee members resigned in order to become assessors
It appears that the double roles performed by committe members, who generally were also assessors and/or instructors, also influenced the committee's performance, especially its punctuality in finalizing certification activities
Based on the schedule arranged by MoNE, LPTKs need around four months from the start of portfolio assessment to the provision of certificates to participants
Because portfolio assessment for 2007 participants began in October 2007, participants who passed should have received certificates in February 2008
However, in practice, at the time this field study ended in June 2008, only the LPTK in West Kalimantan had provided certificates, and even this was only for some participants
2.2 Socialization
Socialization is a process of distributing information about the details of a program, so it has a very important role in the success of a program's implementation
It is hoped that by conducting socialization a program can be implemented by its rules, and more transparently
The socialization of the teacher certification program was run by both MoNE and MoRA, in similar stages
Socialization was carried out through formal meetings which were accompanied by the distribution of a short paper or guidebooks
It was also carried out in a general way in various meetings for other activities
Currently formal socialization activities have only been aimed at program implementers (the provincial education office, LPMP, MoRA provincial office, the education office/ MoRA kabupaten/kota offices, and LPTKs) and certification participants
However, formal socialization through meetings with other parties such as non-participant teachers, NGOs concerned with education, teacher associations, private school associations, and the general public has not been carried out
Despite this the various parties can access information from other sources like the internet, and print and electronic media
2.2.1 Socialization for Program Implementers
Socialization for MoNE program implementers is conducted in stages, starting from the central level, followed by the province, then the kabupaten/kota
In 2006 and 2007 socialization at the national level was done by inviting provincial education office officials, LPMP, the kabupaten/kota education office, LPTKs and others to Jakarta
The MoNE socialization team provided the material for this activity
In 2008 national socialization was abolished
As a replacement the MoNE socialization team visited every province to provide socialization, which was implemented by LPMP, with participants from the provincial education office, LPMP, LPTK, and the kabupaten/kota education office
Certification implementers under MoRA ran socialization slightly differently, because the directorate handling certification in MoRA had a different policy
The Directorate of Islamic Education ran socialization on a regional basis in five provincial capitals (Medan, Palembang, Semarang, Surabaya, and Makassar) by inviting implementers from all provincial and kabupaten/kota offices, and contributors of material from MoRA and MoNE
The Directorate of Islamic Schools did not provide a special budget for socialization and asked the provincial and kabupaten/kota offices to redirect funding already allocated for meetings or training to socialization
When the provincial or kabupaten/kota office was ready, the central MoRA office would delegate speakers from MoRA, LPTK, and the respective provincial offices
Apart from undertaking socialization, LPTK committee members also received special training in Jakarta
Meanwhile assessors received socialization and training upon recruitment into the respective LPTKs
To accompany the implementation of the program MoNE provides guidebooks which are divided into several books according to the stage of activity
In every socialization activity for program implementers, participants receive a guidebook in accordance with their respective roles
The guidebook greatly assists implementers in understanding the technical implementation of certification in greater depth
2.2.2 Socialization for Participants
The education office and MoRA kabupaten/kota office should form the spearhead for the implementation of certification for schools and teachers in their jurisdictions
However, because there were no program funds available specifically for socialization, formal socialization from the education office and MoRA kabupaten/kota offices varied between study areas depending on regional government policy and the respective institutions
The education office and MoRA kabupaten/kota office in Jambi did not run socialization for the UPTD, inspectors, and school principals and certification participants because it was already run at the provincial level
Meanwhile in West Java socialization at the kabupaten/kota level, through both MoNE and MoRA, was run several times with different participants, that is for the head of the UPTD, inspectors, and school principals
Socialization for certification participants was divided into several stages according to the total number of participants and the level of education
In West Kalimantan, only the education office at the kabupaten/kota level ran socialization, while the MoRA kabupaten/kota office did not run socialization because the total number of teachers was too small
Socialization for participants was thus held directly at the provincial level
The distribution of guidebooks or photocopies for participant teachers' socialization varied across study areas
Because the program did not provide special funding for socialization, the distribution of guidebooks or photocopies depended upon the respective education office policy and MoRA kabupaten/kota office
In Jambi, both MoNE and MoRA certification participants only received copies of the short paper that was presented
If participants wished to have a guidebook they needed to photocopy it themselves, and some participants bought the guidebook from the education office for Rp30,000
In West Java, because the kabupaten/kota government provided a budget for socialization, all participants were able to receive a photocopy of the guidebook free of charge
Even the education office in Majalengka provided photocopies of the guidebook for teachers who needed it, both certification participants and non-participants
In West Kalimantan, MoRA certification participants received a photocopy of the guidebook at the time of socialization at the provincial level, while MoNE participants did not, except if they photocopied it themselves
In each of the socialization activities, participants did not pick up any of the costs
In the case of Singkawang, West Kalimantan, the district education office worked with LPMP and the LPTK to carry out additional socialization for participants for the 2008 quota at a cost of Rp65,000 per participant
Informants who participated in socialization did not object to the cost because they felt that they understood certification more and they received guidebooks and certificates which could be enclosed in their portfolios
In parts of the study areas, participants were also able to obtain information directly from staff from the education office and MoRA kabupaten/kota office in the form of consultations, particularly when compiling their portfolios
In West Java, for example, staff from the education office and MoRA kabupaten/kota office who handle certification were available for consultations throughout office hours
In addition to socialization through formal meetings and the distribution of the guidebook, information about certification was also communicated in a non-specific way through various activities involving teachers or school principals, like working groups for teachers (KKG), teaching subject conferences for teachers (MGMP), working groups for school/Islamic school principals (MKKS/MKKM), and teacher training
Socialization of this type was also attended by non-participant teachers and usually provided general information about certification
2.2.3 Socialization for Non-participant Teachers and the General Public
Non-participant teachers have never been included in formal socialization activities, except in Majalengka, where the LPMP held socialization for potential 2009 participants when 2008 participants had already submitted their portfolios
In general non-participant teachers obtained information from other teachers, particularly those who had already been certification participants
Some also obtained information from various other meetings or from mass media sources like television, radio and newspapers, which only contained general information
The government provides more complete information which can be accessed by the general public through a website especially for certification
However, the number of participants and non-participants which access it is still very limited
This is not only because of limited internet facilities, but also because very few have the ability to operate a computer
Certification participants in several sample schools had also accessed the certification website seeking information about passing certification and the distribution of the professional allowance
But, they were generally disappointed because they did not find the information they sought
Other organizations concerned about education also ran socialization programs, both directly and indirectly
In Jambi, because of the shortcomings in socialization by the government, the PGRI Foundation ran socialization activities for teachers in the area through bulletins, radio programs, and meetings
The foundation even planned to socialize the program more widely through a local television station, Jambi TV
In Bekasi, West Java, the local education board provided an explanation of certification in a media newsletter publication in April 2008
Various organizations also ran socialization through commercial seminar activities with fees of Rp40,000-Rp250,000 per participant
In Jambi, a local newspaper ran seminars about certification in every kabupaten/kota
In the sample kabupaten/kota in West Java, many organizations held seminars in conjunction with agencies or with individuals from government agencies and LPTKs as speakers
As an example, one source confessed that he had been a speaker in this kind of seminar around 11 times in various kabupaten/kota in West Java since certification was established
The person involved was willing to be a speaker so that the information distributed to participants was correct, and because he thought that the seminar would be beneficial for teachers
Through the seminars, which have become popular since the end of 2007, participants receive certificates that can be used in their portfolios
2.2.4 The Effectiveness of Socialization
In terms of quantity, socialization for program implementers generally suffices, but from a quality point of view it still needs improvement
This can be seen from the fact that implementers in the field still do not fully understand certification
In Jambi, for example, teachers thought the kabupaten/kota education office did not understand the certification program well
When teachers needed further information the education office was not able to provide it in a clear and satisfying manner
In West Kalimantan implementers from the same education office did not have the same understanding of the division of certification between MoNE and MoRA, and there were Islamic school teachers who were summoned to be certified through MoNE
Meanwhile, in West Java, although there were cases of teachers being summoned in error or by both organizations generally teachers felt quite satisfied with the explanations provided by the local education office and MoRA kabupaten/kota office, except for the education office in Bekasi, where there was a change in implementation staff
It was also felt that the one-day training session for assessors was insufficient
At the start of implementation generally assessors were still confused about the mechanism for assessing portfolios, and had to ask the committee and other assessors many questions, as well as read the guidebook for LPTKs
After assessing portfolios several times, they began to understand how to do a portfolio assessment
In general, after certification entered its second year, participants' understanding of certification, particularly how to compile portfolios and the criteria for portfolio assessment, became relatively good
At the start of certification implementation, participants' understanding was still limited, particularly for the 2006 quota, because at the time certification was a new program
In addition, the education office and MoRA kabupaten/kota office, which were intended to guide certification material, had relatively low levels of understanding
The understanding of participants in the 2007 quota and additional 2007 quotas was slightly better because there were example portfolios from 2006
However, because the total 2006 quota was not large, only a limited number of example portfolios were distributed, and not all 2007 participants could access them
Meanwhile 2008 participants' understanding was far better because of an increasing and fairly even spread of information sources, like the participant guidebook, example portfolios and previous participants, and the education office and MoRA kabupaten/kota office as well as their staff
However, the information participants obtained was not comprehensive
In general teachers only understood how to compile portfolios, the portfolio assessment criteria, the requirements relating to completion of an undergraduate degree and the length of teaching experience, the assessing organizations, and the receipt of an allowance for teachers who pass
A large proportion of the teachers also did not understand how much the professional allowance would be, when it would begin, and how it would be paid
Information that the allowance was equal to a single month's basic wage (gaji pokok) was widespread, however, participants still did not know which year's basic wage it would be based on
NIP 13 teachers certified through MoRA and NIP 15 religion teachers in public schools who shifted to teaching general studies and were certified through MoNE were also still confused about which organization would arrange and pay the professional allowance
This demonstrates the incompleteness of information dissemination and the tendency for socialization to focus only on the requirements participants must fulfill
Currently, non-participant teachers have a fairly good understanding of certification, although still limited to the general participant requirements, the collection of certificates, and the existence of the professional allowance
Some of these teachers have already started to prepare supporting documents for their portfolios
Several have already tried to estimate the mark they will receive and have planned various activities to complete their portfolios with the documents they did not yet have
2.3 Determination of Quotas
At the national level the total number of certification participants, or quota, is determined annually by the central government, and divided between the two implementation channels, MoNE and MoRA
The 2007 certification quota was set three times, in the form of the 2006 quota, the 2007 quota, and the additional 2007 quota
Meanwhile, the quota for 2008 certification has been set once
In total, the certification quota at the national level increased from 225,211 participants in 2007 to 249,966 participants in 2008, an increase of 24,755 participants (11%)
In Table 3 it can be seen that the MoNE quota decreased slightly from 200,450 participants to 200,000 participants (0.2%), while the MoRA quota increased by 101.8%, from 24,761 to 49,966 participants
If viewed by the total number of participants, the MoRA quota was far smaller than the MoNE quota, although its proportion of the total increased from 0.12 in 2007 to 0.25 in 2008
The difference in the quotas is particularly due to the difference in the total number of teachers under each institution's jurisdiction
In 2007, there were 603,000 teachers under MoRA, compared to 2,245,952 under MoNE
The quota for each of the implementation channels was broken down into quotas for each province and kabupaten/kota
These quotas were based on the total number of teachers under each organizations' jurisdiction in each region
Data on the total number of teachers was sourced from data already provided in periodic routine reports sent by schools to the kabupaten/kota education office
The mechanism for determining each region's quota differed for each organization, depending on their respective policies
2.3.1 The Determination of the MoNE Quota
The process of determining the quota for certification through MoNE has changed from year to year, and in general the arrangements for determining the 2008 quota show an improvement on the previous year
For the 2006 and 2007 quota the allocations at the kabupaten/kota level were set centrally by the Director General for PMPTK in MoNE
For the additional 2007 quota, MoNE only set provincial level quotas, and each province then determined the quotas for each kabupaten/kota in its jurisdiction
The same was done for the 2008 quota
However, the kabupaten/kota quota was jointly determined by the kabupaten/kota education office, the provincial education office, and LPMP
For the determination of the 2006 quota, the province and the kabupaten/kota only received quotas for civil servant teachers, for the primary and junior high school levels only
The quota for junior high schools was divided by subject of study, which included citizenship studies, Indonesian, English, mathematics, physics, biology, economics, geography, and history
For the 2007 quota, the province and kabupaten/kota received quotas which were only divided based on the level of education (pre-school, primary school, junior high school, senior high school and special needs schools), both private and public, without being divided by subject of study
In addition to this, the quota was already split 75%-25% between civil servant and non-civil servant teachers
For the additional 2007 quota, the province received a quota which was only based on teachers who were high performing and other teachers, and the province then determined the division across kabupaten/kota
For the 2008 quota, the province also received a global total which was then allocated to each kabupaten/kota by dividing the quota by level of education and civil servant/non-civil servant status, with 70-85% allocated to civil servants and 15-30% to non-civil servant teachers
The method of calculating the quota for each level of government and level of education are basically the same
The total quota for one region is obtained by dividing the total number of teachers in the relevant area by the total number of teachers in the jurisdiction above it, multiplied by the total quota received by the jurisdiction above it
For the 2008 quota, the calculations for the kabupaten/kota quotas were not based on the total number of teachers, but rather on the total number of teachers who had an undergraduate degree/D4 in each kabupaten/kota
For implementation in the study areas, the quota was determined and divided in accordance with the rules i.e set until the kabupaten/kota level, per level of education, and teacher status
The division of the kabupaten/kota was proportional to the total number of teachers in each area
An exception only occurred in the division of the additional 2007 quota in Jambi, where the quota was divided evenly between each kabupaten/kota
In West Java the 2008 quota was divided between kabupaten/kota based not only on the total number of teachers with an undergraduate degree/D4 but also on the number of these teachers who also had a NUPTK in each kabupaten/kota
In 2007, the quota for civil servant and non-civil servant was fixed or not able to be changed
The kabupaten/kota education office was only able to redistribute the quota between levels of education because it was rational and could be accounted for
However, from 2008 the kabupaten/kota education office has been allowed to redistribute the quota between civil servant and non-civil servant groups, which also had to be under the agreement of the Cooperative Body of Private System teachers (Badan Musyawarah Perguruan Swasta) at the kabupaten level, although in practice this was a formality
In Majalengka, West Java, apart from being distributed between the civil servant and non-civil servant teachers, the 2008 quota was also divided by level of education because of the limited number of teachers in the non-civil servant group and particular levels of education who fulfilled the criteria
Although the provision of authority to the kabupaten/kota education office to redistribute the quota was positive, because it could avoid the possibility of not filling the quota, it could also give rise to misuse if it was not implemented transparently
For example, in Muara, Jambi, all the non-civil servant quotas in 2008 certification were reallocated to civil servants although there were many non-civil servant teachers who fulfilled the criteria
The determination of the quota for the kabupaten/kota level by the provincial education office, LPMP, and kabupaten/kota education office, was positive because it made it possible for the quota to be adjusted based on the conditions in each area
For example, the calculations for the 2008 quotas received by Majalengka, West Java and Kota Jambi changed after the relevant kabupaten/kota objected
In West Java, after the provincial education office and LPMP calculated the quotas, the kabupaten/kota education offices were invited to discuss the quotas
At or after the meeting some kabupaten/kota offices objected to the calculations because the total number of teachers with an undergraduate degree/D4 who had a NUPTK, which was used as the basis for calculations, was inaccurate
Kabupaten Majalengka was one of those which objected because the total number of teachers counted was only 3,000, but based on data from the internet there were approximately 9,000 teachers with NUPTKs in the district
After the kabupaten office lodged an objection with the province and confirmed the total number of teachers with a NUPTK with the MoNE, the provincial education office officially announced an increase in the quota from 197 to 736
Meanwhile the 2008 quota for Kota Jambi increased from 919 to 1,000
It was thought that the increase in Kota Jambi's quota would decrease the quota of other kabupaten/kota because the provincial quota had been already been determined
The total certification quota for 2007 varied between provinces and kabupaten/kota in the study areas
The provincial and kabupaten/kota quotas in West Java were larger than other provinces and kabupaten/kota in the study areas, proportional to the total number of teachers in each region
With the exception of Kota Jambi, the 2008 certification quota increased at the provincial level, but decreased for the sample kabupaten/kota
The change in the total quotas amongst kabupaten/kota from 2007 to 2008 certification does not display a set pattern
It is thought that this is due to the change in the basis upon which the quota is divided, among other things (see Table 4)
Considering the total number of teachers fulfilling the participant requirements, the quotas for some kabupaten/kota, such as Majalengka, Bekasi, Jambi and Sinkawang, were too low, and the quotas for others, such as Melawi, were too high
This shows that the number of teachers with undergraduate degrees/D4 in these areas is limited or spread unevenly, and that the data used to determine the quotas was inaccurate because it was not the latest data available
In addition, the excesses and shortages in the quotas were also caused by the fact that the quota was determined using the total number of teachers, while participants were chosen, based on the requirement of having an undergraduate degree/D4
2.3.2 Determination of the Quota under MoRA Unlike MoNE quotas, MoRA quotas were determined centrally by the central office based on the total number of teachers with an undergraduate degree, the level of education, and subject
MoRA provincial and kabupaten/kota offices only received quotas for their respective areas
They received 2006, 2007 and additional 2007 quotas, known in MoRA as stage I, II and III quotas, while the 2008 quota was only determined at the national level and has not been divided between the levels below it
In 2006 Islamic religion teachers in public schools did not receive a share of the quota, so the entire quota was allocated to teachers in Islamic schools
In general MoRA kabupaten/kota offices and religion teachers thought that the quota MoRA received was too small in comparison to the quota received by MoNE
Generally teachers thought that the division of total participants between schools was relatively fair and in line with the total number of teachers who had an undergraduate degree
2.3.3 Level at which Quotas were Filled 
Based on Table 5, it can be seen that in all the study areas the quotas received through MoNE were not filled
The portfolios collected and assessed by the LPTKs only filled 54.5%-95.5% of the total quotas received by the various regions
Kabupaten/kota in Java and urban areas outside of Java filled their quotas to higher level, between 88.6%-95.5%, while kabupaten outside of Java only filled the quotas to around 55%
This may be due to differences in the ease of information transfers, the availability and completeness of teachers' data, and the number of the teachers fulfilling the requirements
The fact that kabupaten/kota education offices lacked the authority to distribute their quotas between civil servant and non-civil servant teachers in 2007 and the existence of participants who withdrew from the certification process were other causes of the unfulfilled quotas
All implementers in the study areas acknowledged that there were candidates who withdrew from the process
Participants resigned for various reasons, including because they received information about participating in the program too late, did not have enough time to compile portfolios, thought their portfolio score would be too low, and other personal reasons
If time allowed, the education office sought replacement participants, 
however, if time did not allow for this then the participants' places would remain unfilled, and the quota for the region would not be filled
The the fact that quotas were not filled was also influenced by the fact that a list of teachers who had filled the undergraduate degree/D4 requirement was not made available
If the kabupaten/kota education office provided this list, teachers who had not yet participated in certification would be able to more easily gauge when they would be summoned to participate, and be able to prepare more comprehensively
Several staff in the kabupaten/kota education office said that the list was not made openly available because it needed to be updated
In addition, the ranked list would constantly change because of the addition of teachers who had just completed an undergraduate degree/D4, as the time that teachers completed the required qualification was not considered when ranking teachers
Despite this, it is estimated that the 2008 quotas will be filled to higher levels, provided there are teachers who fulfill the requirements
This is because information about the program and example portfolios have been distributed fairly widely
In addition, many teachers who have not yet participated have already started to prepare material for their portfolios, such as by collecting various documents, both those they have and do not have
They obtain documents they do not have by undertaking training and attending seminars in their respective regions
2.4 Determination of Participants 
2.4.1 Participant Requirements and Criteria 
The general requirements for certification participants are the completion of at least an undergraduate degree or D4, to be teaching in a school under the jurisdiction of MoNE or MoRA, to be a civil servant or non-civil servant teacher, and be listed on a directive from the education office or MoRA
There was also an additional requirement of a minimum of two years work experience for the 2006, 2007, and additional 2007 quotas, and of five years for the 2008 quota
Non-civil servant teachers also needed to be a permanent staff member with a minimum of five years working in one school or in schools within the same organization
Because of the quota, the criteria upon which participants were chosen differed between MoNE and MoRA certification, 
however, in general the criteria covered length of employment, age, and teaching workload
The method of selecting participants under MoNE differed for the 2006, 2007, additional 2007 and 2008 quotas
For the 2006 quota, participants were selected based on a set of ordered criteria academic performance, teaching workload, and length of employment
For the 2007 quota, the order of the criteria changed to become length of employment, age, rank/group, teaching workload, position/additional tasks, and work performance
For the additional 2007 quota, the criteria were academic performance and length of employment
For the 2008 quota, the order of the criteria was the same as in 2007 certification, but participants were also required to have an NUPTK, as well as an undergraduate degree/D4
The criteria used to select participants under MoRA differed between Islamic education teachers and teachers in Islamic schools
Islamic education teachers were selected using the same criteria as MoNE certification, but teachers in Islamic schools were selected based on different criteria
The criteria for Islamic school teachers also changed between 2007 and 2008 certification
For the selection of 2007 participants, which was based on the 2006, 2007, and additional 2007 quotas, weightings were used for workload (35%), length of service (30%), appropriateness of educational background to the subject taught (20%) and age (15%), while in the selection of 2008 quota participants it changed to become workload (20%), length of service (50%), and age (30%)
The requirements and criteria for certification participants are detailed in Table 6
In the study areas the rules about the general requirements for participants were applied in full, but the stipulated criteria for participants were adapted in several areas
For certification under MoNE, length of employment was the main criterion used to select 2006 and 2008 participants
Meanwhile the academic performance criterion was applied in Jambi for the 2006 and additional 2007 quotas and in Majalengka, West Java for the additional 2007 quota
2.4.2 Method of Determining Certification Participants under MoNE 
The methods and processes the kabupaten/kota education offices used in selecting MoNE certification participants varied between regions and quotas
The process of selecting participants was more rigid in regions where the number of teachers fulfilling the qualification requirement and criteria exceeded the total quota
In Jambi, participants for 2006 quota were selected on the basis of a written test
The test was taken by civil servant primary and junior high school teachers who were nominated by primary school inspectors and junior high school principals
2007 participants were chosen from teachers' data, which was available in the kabupaten/kota education offices and ordered based on set criteria
However, there was an indication that this data was incomplete and invalid, so the kabupaten/kota education offices were still able to accommodate individual offers from teachers who fulfilled the criteria
Meanwhile participants for the additional 2007 quota were recruited from teachers who performed well, that is teachers who were placed 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in their kabupaten/kota, for each level of education
In fulfilling the 2008 quota, the education office in Kabupaten Muara Jambi obtained data for teachers with NUPTKs from LPMP and then verified this
This data was then sent back to the LPMP for re-verification
Meanwhile the education office in Kota Jambi did not verify the data received from the LPMP so it included several names of teachers who had been 2007 participants, moved workplaces, and had even passed away
In West Java, 2006 quota participants were selected based on teachers' data ordered by Civil Servant Identification Number (NIP)
Participants in the 2007, additional 2007, and 2008 quotas were determined based on data submitted by the UPTD (for pre-school and primary schools) and school principals (for junior high school, senior high school, and vocational high schools)
A small proportion of the additional 2007 quota, which was allocated to high performing teachers, was chosen from teachers who performed well at the provincial level
In Majalengka, West Java, in 2008, the UPTD, inspectors, and junior, senior, and vocational high school principals were given an opportunity to verify candidates to establish whether they were suitable to undertake certification
As a result seven participants were replaced because their performance was judged to be poor
In West Kalimantan, 2006 and 2007 certification participants were selected based on teachers' data already available at the kabupaten/kota education office, and ranked based on set criteria
In both Singkawang and Melawi 2008 participants were not ranked because the quota each kabupaten/kota received exceeded the total number of teachers fulfilling the criteria, so that all teachers who had an undergraduate degree and a minimum of five years work experience were able to participate
The role of school principals in determining participants was relatively small, and differed between regions
In Jambi, school principals had no role, except in nominating candidates to be tested for 2006 certification
In West Java, from 2007 school principals had a role in nominating participants
In addition, in Majalengka, West Java, school principals and superintendents were able to verify candidates before they were accepted
In West Kalimantan school principals did not have a role in determining participants, except in one private Islamic primary school in 2008, where the education office asked the school principal to choose four teachers who fulfilled the criteria to become participants
There is an indication and suspicion of deception in the determination of certification participants at the kabupaten/kota level
In Jambi, several teacher sources raised the suspicion of deception, because the determination of participants was not transparent and there were participants who had a shorter length of work experience than teachers who had not been participants
In Bekasi, West Java, an indication of deception arose because the process of replacing participants who withdrew did not use set procedures, and was based only on the recommendations of the teachers who had withdrew
In West Kalimantan, deception occurred because there were participants who had a shorter length of work experience than teachers who had not become participants, and there were teachers who became participants after becoming close to kabupaten/kota education staff
In contrast, there were no indications of deception at the school level because several school principals who were involved in organizing potential candidates created a list of teachers transparently, openly known to all teachers
The list of successful participants was announced in a directive from the head of the kabupaten/kota education office
Each participant was given a participant number by their respective kabupaten/kota education office based on the group serial number they were given by LPMP
The participant number consisted of 14 numbers displaying the year, province, kabupaten/kota, level and field of study, and serial number
LPTKs complained about inaccuracies in the issuing of participant numbers by the kabupaten/kota education office, such as mistakes in recording and coding regions and subject areas
As a result LPTKs had to check and confirm this information, which took up time
In order to overcome this problem, in 2008 certification the LPTK in West Java checked participant numbers early in implementation when portfolios were newly received
The directive announcing the selected participants was usually issued after potential participants submitted their portfolios
This was because the drafting of the directive tended to be only a reporting formality rather than a letter informing candidates whether they were successful in becoming participants
In addition, the list of participants could also change because there were participants who did not compile a portfolio
2.4.3 Method of Determining Certification Participants under MoRA 
From the 2006 to 2008 quotas, MoRA certification participants were selected directly by the central level agency
The Ministry's provincial and kabupaten/kota offices only received a list of the names of the teachers who had been selected, along with the names of reserve participants
At the start of program implementation, MoRA, through its provincial office, kabupaten/kota offices and schools, asked Islamic school teachers and Islamic education teachers in public schools who had an undergraduate degree/D4 to complete a certification registration form
Completed forms were submitted to MoRA's kabupaten/kota offices, which then forwarded the forms to the provincial office
From the provincial office, Islamic school teachers' forms were sent to three higher education institutions appointed by the MoRA to process data and assess participants' weighted criteria
UIN Sultan Syarif Qosim, in Riau for western Indonesia; IAIN Wali Songo, in Semarang for central Indonesia, and UIN Alauddin, in Makassar, for eastern Indonesia
Meanwhile the MoRA central office processed the data for Islamic education teachers
Based on the results of this data processing, the central office determined the ranking and names of certification participants for the 2006, 2007, additional 2007 and 2008 quotas
Teachers with the highest scores in each subject area, stage of education, and kabupaten/kota were chosen to participate
The total number chosen was proportional to the total number of teachers who registered per subject, stage of education, and kabupaten/kota
MoRA has long compiled teachers' data through EMIS (Education Management Information System), which holds information on all teachers under its jurisdiction in a database, and is updated every three months
Based on this data, MoRA discovered that not all of the teachers fulfilling the criteria registered for certification
There are a number of reasons why teachers did not register, including a lack of socialization and hesitancy to undertake certification
MoRA has given teachers who have not yet registered for 2009 certification the opportunity to complete the registration form in 2008
However, teachers who registered but have not been called to be certified must re-register
Teachers in the study areas thought that the method of selecting certification participants through MoRA central office was not transparent
This assessment is supported by the fact that there were participants who were younger, or had less work experience than nonparticipant teachers
MoRA's kabupaten/kota offices had differing views about the determination of participants at the central MoRA office
Some kabupaten/kota offices agree with it, because they felt free of the burden and responsibility of dealing with teachers' complaints and accusations of deception
However, some kabupaten/kota offices did not agree with the process because they thought it was not transparent, felt that they did not have any authority in selecting the participants from their region, and were not able to provide explanations if there were teachers who put forward complaints
According to the MoRA central office, there were participants who were younger than nonparticipants because in 2007 certification there were per subject quotas
The larger the total number of teachers from certain subject areas fulfilling the criteria, the bigger the quota the group would receive
If a specific group had more young teachers, then it would be more probable that young teachers would be chosen as participants
Based on this experience, and to make fairness a more prominent aspect of the program, in 2008 the per subject quotas were removed, leaving only quotas for each level of education and kabupaten/kota
2.5 Portfolios and Their Assessment 
The portfolio is physical proof (documentation) demonstrating a teacher's work experience and professional achievements over a set period of time
This documentation covers ten components reflecting pedagogical, personal, social, and professional skills (Table 7)
Certification participants must arrange their portfolio documents according to a format and rules set out in the participant guidebook
The documents must be verified by a superior, that is, a school principal for teachers, and inspector for school principals
Participants must also have photocopies of their formal qualifications verified by their university
If participants work in a remote area or a different province to that in which they studied they may verify their documents at the MoNE or MoRA office in their kabupaten/kota
2.5.1 Compilation of the Portfolio 
Participants should not have found the compilation of the portfolio difficult, as the portfolio is basically a collection of documents relating to activities they had already performed
However, because the portfolio was something new, and in several regions, was not accompanied by integrated socialization, many participants did not fully understand the technical aspects of its compilation, particularly the placement of the various documents
For example, many participants asked whether certificates from seminars should be included under the Education and training component or under the Participation in scientific forums component
To overcome these issues participants usually worked with other participants, asked previous participants, or consulted the local education or MoRA office
The guidebook for the portfolio and examples of previous participants' portfolios was also important in assisting participants
Many participants faced technical obstacles in compiling their portfolios, as some very old documents were lost or participants couldn't remember where they stored them
Participants could ask the relevant institution, such as the school, kabupaten/kota education and MoRA offices, etc., for copies of certain documents, provided that they could prove that they owned them
There were also many participants who did not have lesson plans, which all teachers should have, and so had to create new ones
Another obstacle was the limited time provided to compile the portfolio
Many participants were only given about one week to compile their portfolios, 
and participants in the additional 2007 quota were given only about three to five days
According to many respondents, the ideal time required for portfolio compilation is around two weeks
Some participants also experienced difficulty in providing documentation for education and training activities and seminars because they had rarely attended them
This was because many of these activities and seminars were only attended by the school principal, or teachers close to the school principal or considered most capable
As a result, several participants were forced to withdraw because they felt unable to compile the portfolio in the set time or thought their portfolio scores would be too low
Although it was not required, generally participants used a computer to produce their portfolios
Because in general participants did not have, or could not operate, a computer, they usually rented a typing service
Those whose schools had a computer usually asked the school administration section for help
Although they received help with the typing, in general participants completed their own portfolios, collected documents and arranged document verification themselves
Usually they also provided the main concepts contained in the typed section of the portfolio
In almost all regions there were sources who reported that there was an indication of deception in the creation of the portfolios
The deception reported by teachers and school principals included falsified education, training, seminar and competition certificates, and plagiarized portfolio documents like lesson plans from electronic files
There were informants who had seen and been offered false certificates, as well as informants who had their documents copied by other participants
One informant received offers to have his portfolios made for him
There was even a source who was often asked to produce part or all of other participants' portfolios
In the latter case participants usually provided the data and documents needed and the informant would then enter the information into the form provided, create lesson plans, and simultaneously arrange them into a portfolio
In doing this the informant would use his regular typing service, which already had electronic copies of the required documents
Cases of deception were also cited by sections of the education and MoRA offices in the study areas, and generally took the form of false seminar certificates
However, the organization found only a relatively small number of cases because they generally only checked that all the required documents were included, without examining the documents in detail
Assessors also reported that there were false portfolio documents, such as qualification certificates containing verification stamps which appeared to be computer-scanned; certificates listing female names but displaying photos of males; portfolios with certificates spanning the start of the participant's career until the present, all with the same photo; certificates containing differing fonts, and other similar cases
Based on an examination of several portfolios, there was also a portfolio which had seven certificates of participation in competitions, which appeared to be duplicates because the name, form, and contents were the same, but the type of activity and year were made different
The fairly large amount of deception which occurred in 2007 encouraged a policy change for 2008 certification
In 2008 certification, documents have been checked for authenticity and validity at various stages before being sent to the LPTKs, starting with school principals and continuing to the kabupaten/kota education office, and involving school inspectors
In addition, for the Education and Training, and Participation in Scientific Forums components of the portfolios, participants have been required to enclose original documents
On one hand the policy of including original documents avoids the risk of false documents, but on the other hand it could also become a burden for LPTKs and the education and MoRA kabupaten/kota offices, who have become responsible for the security and return of the documents to participants
Participants also spent money in making the portfolios, which generally covered the cost of photocopying documents, verifying academic transcripts and certificates, typing, and making copies of portfolios
The cost participants spent on compiling portfolios varied, ranging from Rp100.000 to Rp500.000
There were several cases where participants spent more money on their portfolios, such as in West Kalimantan where a participant spent Rp1.5 million, and in West Java, where a participant spent Rp1.2 million
This large amount was in part due to participants' efforts to make portfolios as comprehensive and high quality as possible, so when there was a mistake they would have to re-print typed documents
If they used a typing service, participants had to pay between Rp2,000 and Rp6,000 per page for typing and printing
The cost of copying and binding portfolios was also quite high, because there were participants who printed up to five copies, and in some regions the cost of photocopying was as high as Rp300 per page
In Kota Bekasi, West Java, several participants gave their inspectors/supervisors and the UPTD around Rp30,000-Rp150,000 as a token of their appreciation for their assessment, guidance, and assistance in verifying documents
In Melawi, West Kalimantan, there were also informants who paid Rp10,000 when verifying their documents at the district education office because a donation box was provided
Many participants did not mind paying this money because they thought it reasonable and they hoped to get the professional allowance
However, others felt burdened because they thought that the payments required were quite high; some even had to borrow money
Generally participants acknowledged that they provided the thank-you money voluntarily, and the amount depended on each participant
Despite this, if this practice has become entrenched, then all participants will try to provide this money, even though it is voluntary
One NGO member who was an informant thought that the practice of giving this money had already become entrenched in big cities, and that it was hard to avoid and eliminate because the community was materialistic
Providing money would usually make a procedure smoother, 
and not providing money would make a process more difficult
2.5.2 Collection of the Portfolios 
Whatever the procedures, a large proportion of participants submitted their portfolios to the kabupaten/kota education or MoRA office, both directly as well as through the school principal, a participant representative, or the UPTD
The kabupaten/kota education or MoRA then submitted the portfolios to the designated LPTK
A small number of participants in West Kalimantan submitted their portfolios to the MoRA provincial office or directly to the LPTK
Only the LPTK in West Kalimantan was able to accept the portfolios directly, but this was because there was an accompanying letter from the education office, and only for participants who submitted their portfolios late
Participants were asked to submit two or three copies of their portfolio, depending on the kabupaten/kota education or MoRA office
The kabupaten/kota education and MoRA offices submitted two copies of participants' portfolios to the relevant LPTK
According to information from LPTKs, participants usually provided two copies of their portfolio, 
although there were participants who provided one, three, or even four copies
This is in accordance with the findings from the field, which indicate that there were still participants who did not know how many copies of the portfolio needed to be sent to the LPTK for assessment
Some informants submitted one copy of their portfolio but were then asked to make duplicates by the kabupaten/kota education office
In Bekasi, West Java, there were participants who made two different copies of their portfolios
One copy was complete, and intended for assessment by the LPTK, while the other was thought to be only for the education office's files, and included whatever the participants happened to have
Other participants made five copies so that the three other copies were stored as personal files and lent to other teachers as examples
The LPTK also said that it discovered there were different versions of participants' portfolios because of differences in the scores given by the two assessors
When participants submitted their portfolios, the UPTD and kabupaten/kota education or MoRA office would check that they were complete
If a portfolio was incomplete, or if there was a mistake or another issue, the participant was asked to rectify it
Because of this, participants usually first presented portfolios which had not been bound and copied, for the purpose of checking whether their portfolios complied
When arranging the portfolios for agencies at the kabupaten/kota level some participants paid for the cost of sending the portfolios to the LPTK because the program had no allocated budget for this activity
In Kota Bekasi, West Java, participants paid an average of Rp50.000, while in Singkawang, West Kalimantan, participants paid between Rp25,000-Rp50,000
In Kota Bekasi this money was managed by the education office, while in Singkawang it was managed by the teacher coordinators for each education level who were involved in submitting the portfolios to the LPTK
The amount set by each participant group varied
2.5.3 Mechanism of Portfolio Assessment 
Portfolio assessment was completed at the LPTKs designated for each area
Assessors ran the portfolio assessment, and assessed portfolios according to their area of expertise
If there were no assessors for the required subject area, the LPTK could work with other LPTKs which had the assessors required
For example, the LPTK in Jambi sent 71 portfolios to Universitas Negeri Jakarta (UNJ) for technical studies and art, drama, and dance studies, while the LPTK in West Java received portfolios from other LPTKs for Sundanese and Japanese language studies, and school counselors
Portfolio assessment involved ten components, each with a maximum score, as detailed in the portfolio assessment guidelines
These components were then arranged into three elements
Element A (Qualifications and Main Tasks); 
Element B (Professional Development); and 
Element C (Professional Support)
The score from the Qualifications and Main Tasks element could not be less than 300 and none of the sub-elements could be zero
The score for the Professional Development element had to be at least 200, except for teachers placed in special areas, where the minimal score was only 150
The score for the professional support element could not be zero and could be a maximum of 100
The maximum score for all the components was 1500, while the pass mark was set at 850, or 57% of the maximum score (see Table 8)
The two copies of each participant's portfolio were assessed by two assessors with reference to the assessment guidebook from MoNE
The assessment was done in a set room and portfolios were not allowed to be carried outside the room
Every day one assessor assessed a maximum of ten portfolios
Two assessors assessing the same portfolio did not contact one another
If the assessment results of the two assessors differed, and the difference exceeded the tolerance threshold, the assessors were summoned and brought together by the committee to discuss the difference using the standards in the assessment guidebook, until they could agree on scores that were not greatly different
The difference threshold was 15 for Element A, 35 for Element B, and 20 for Element C
In practice, there were relatively few cases of highly divergent scores
Large differences in scores occurred if the portfolio an assessor received was incomplete because the participant had submitted two different portfolios
If this occurred, the committee would bring the two assessors together to harmonize their perceptions and the more complete portfolio would be used as the basis of the assessment
Some participants understood the assessment of the portfolio components, and others only had a general understanding
This knowledge was sourced from the guidebook participants received during socialization, before the compilation of the portfolios
Participants who understood the assessment criteria generally tried to assess their own portfolios before submitting them
Almost all informants said that the ten portfolio components were appropriate
They only had differing views about the weightings given to each component
As an example, they suggested that the weightings of several components could be reduced or increased
a) The weighting of academic qualifications was thought to be too high, as qualifications do not guarantee quality teaching
b) Teachers found the education and training component difficult to fulfill because not all teachers, particularly those from remote or rural areas, were given the opportunity to participate in training/seminars/refresher courses and the like
They suggested that the weighting for this component be reduced
c) The weighting of teaching experience needs to be increased because experience is far more more valuable than having a certificate
d) The lesson planning and presentation weighting (maximum score of 160) was thought to be too low because the preparation and presentation of teaching material is a teacher's main task so weighting needs to be increased
e) The weighting for apprasial of superiors was too small, despite being very important because superiors truly know how a teacher performs
Because of this the weighting for the superior's appraisal component should be increased
However, some teachers acknowledged that the superiors' appraisal was not always objective because it was often influenced by how close they were to the teacher
f) The weighting for the assessment of a teacher as a high performing or model teacher needs to be increased because this assessment is an acknowledgement of a teacher's quality
2.5.4 Portfolio Assessment Results 
Portfolio assessment in 2007 certification produced several types of statuses for graduates direct pass (L), complete portfolio (MP), did not pass, undertake remedial training (D), and did not qualify
In West Java there was additional status, unsatisfactory (TM)
Participants were deemed to pass if their portfolio score was at least 850, and their documents were complete and valid
Meanwhile, the range of scores for the MP and D categories varied between LPTKs
In Jambi, participants received an MP if their portfolio scores were 850 or higher but there were documents which were not valid, for example because they had not been verified
Participants received a D if their score was less than 850
In West Java and West Kalimantan, participants received an MP if their score was 841 or more but their documents were incomplete/invalid, and a D if the documents were complete but their score was below 850, or their documents were incomplete and they received a score below 841
Participants granted an MP were asked to provide the missing documents
After the additional documents were checked by assessors, participants who fulfilled the criteria were deemed to pass,
and those who did not were deemed not to pass
Participants who did not pass, either from the portfolio assessment or after MP, were required to undertake remedial training
Participants granted a TM in West Java were generally participants whose portfolio documents did not correspond to the subject being certified
In other regions this type of participant was given did not qualify status
In Majalengka, West Java, participants given TM status were asked to recompile their portfolios as new participants with different participant numbers and for the teaching subject corresponding to their portfolio documents
This meant that they were considered as participants who did not qualify, though they were given an opportunity to participate in the 2007 or additional 2007 intake, which had unfilled places
Participants who did not qualify, or were disqualified, were those who did not have an undergraduate degree/diploma, and in other regions included participants whose portfolio documents did not relate to the teaching subject being certified
In Table 9, which provides the portfolio assessment results for 2007 MoNE certification participants, it can be seen that the percentage of participants who passed directly from portfolio assessment is relatively low, and differs between regions
In Jambi 30.4% of 2,249 participants, in West Java 47.2% of 16,817 participants, and in West Kalimantan 18.8% of 2,818 participants passed directly through portfolio assessment
If examined by kabupaten/kota, the difference in the pass rates is even more pronounced, with the lowest pass rate in Melawi, West Kalimantan, at 7.8%, and the highest pass rate in Majalengka, at 60.9%
The low percentage of passing participants can be attributed to several factors, including a lack of understanding of portfolio compilation, the limited time provided to compile the portfolio and find the required documents, and participants possessing only a limited number of documents or certificates
In Table 9 it can also be seen that the pass rates in kabupaten/kota in Java and urban areas outside Java were higher than other kabupaten
This is thought to be because teachers in Java and urban areas outside Java had better access to activities like training courses and seminars, from which they could obtain certificates
Meanwhile the total number of participants in the MP, TM, and did not qualify categories, both at the provincial and at the district level was relatively low
The total number of participants who were required to complete their portfolios ranged from 0.5% to 3.3%
Only 0.2% of participants in West Java, 0.7% of participants in Majalengka and 0.1% of participants in Bekasi were given TM status
Only two kabupaten/kota in Jambi and West Java had participants who did not qualify, but the percentages were less than 1%
The rules or prerequisites for determining whether participants pass were not always fulfilled
In West Java, for example, although the LPTK committee determined that participants would be ˜MP' if their documents were incomplete and they received a score of 841 or more, in the data there were found to be participants who were deemed MP with scores as low as 670
In West Kalimantan there were even participants who received a score of only 506 who were deemed MP
This was possible because documents with high scores, such as academic qualifications, including formal education certificates, which carry a maximum mark of 525, were not verified and thus not given a score
Differences in the rules and implementation of assessment could be seen in the maximum scores participants obtained
According to the rules participants could receive a maximum score of 1,500
However, in participants' score data there were a number of 2007 certification participants who received scores of more than 1,500
In Table 10 it can be seen that 15 participants in Jambi (2%) and 121 participants in West Java (1.5%) who passed directly in 2007 certification received a score above 1,500
SMERU does not have information about the reasons for this, because the data was obtained after the field visit was undertaken
Table 10 also shows that the scores of participants who passed directly are mainly distributed between 850 and 1,150
If considered by province, in general the participants who passed in West Kalimantan (93.2%) received higher scores than participants in other provinces, with scores falling in the range of more than 1,000 to 1,150
Meanwhile a large proportion of participants who passed in Jambi (64.6%) and in West Java (64.6%) received relatively low scores ranging between 850 and 1,000
From the data provided it can be seen that the large number of participants in the low score group suggests there was no effort to raise scores to the pass mark
This is because the participant scores were distributed normally, and did not cluster around 850
2.5.5 The Accuracy of Portfolio Assessment 
In the study areas, participants' pass statuses were determined based on the results of the LPTKs' assessments
In all stages of the process there was no information about whether there were any irregularities involved
There were several cases in which participants attempted, or assessors offered to influence portfolio scores but the informants admitted that ultimately this was unsuccessful
A large proportion of participants who became informants thought the LPTKs' assessments were accurate and in accordance with the guidebook
This view arose because based on their observations, teachers' pass statuses, including their own, were on par with what they had estimated prior to the process
When the research team asked some of the informants about the scores they had expected to receive, the results did not differ greatly from the results they actually received from the LPTKs
There were institutions which thought that assessments by the LPTKs could be subjective, particularly for teachers who were alumni
However, several participants who had been students at the LPTKs clarified that although several assessors had been their lecturers, they thought the assessors had high integrity, and did not want to leak the results of both the portfolio assessment and the remedial training exam to them
Generally the method of portfolio assessment was kept confidential and participants did not know who would assess their portfolios
In a large proportion of regions participants did not know their portfolio score
They only knew their pass status
In West Kalimantan, however, the LPTK informed participants of their portfolio scores, as well as the marks they received from the various assessors, through the kabupaten/kota education office
This was also the case for MoRA certification participants in all study areas, because the kabupaten/kota office announced both participants' pass statuses and scores
The provision of information about portfolio scores shows that there is transparency, 
but it can also be problematic if it is not accompanied by participants' understanding of the assessment method, the confidentiality of assessors' names, and accuracy in portfolio assessment
If these are absent, then there may be an increase in cases such as that which occurred in West Kalimantan, where a participant complained and made threats because he thought his portfolio score was not appropriate
To better understand the LPTKs' objectivity and consistency in assessing portfolios, SMERU collected 60 sample portfolios from the LPTK in Jambi for reassessment by the LPTK in West Java
From the entire sample only 31 could be compared, because the score data for the remaining 29 portfolios were not obtained from the LPTK in Jambi
The LPTK in Jambi only provided the scores for participants who passed directly from the portfolios assessment, while the portfolios of participants with other pass statuses needed to be specially requested, though they were not all provided
In addition to this, component three (lesson plans and implementation) and component five (appraisal by superior and inspector) were not covered in all 31 samples because in some portfolios assessed by LPTK in West Java the components were not provided, and so were removed (given a score of zero)
In general, the LPTK in Jambi gave higher portfolio scores than the LPTK in West Java
From all the samples which could be compared, 28 (90%) received higher scores from the LPTK in Jambi than from the LPTK in West Java
In addition to this, the average score given by the LPTK in Jambi was 811, 124 marks higher than the LPTK in West Java's average score of 688
For many (74%) of the portfolios, the difference in the scores was less than 200, however, the highest difference in scores was 458
The distribution of the difference in scores between the two LPTKs is provided in Table 11
The spread in the differences in scores between the two LPTKs for each sample can be seen in graphs A1 to A10 in Appendix 1, which compare the scores by portfolio component
From these graphs it can be seen that the coordinates for two LPTKs' assessment scores approach the diagonal line only in components 2 (teaching experience), 4 (education and training), and 8 (participation in scientific forums), but are randomly spread in the other components
This shows that the LPTKs' scores were only consistent for these three components
In Graph A11, Appendix 1, which provides the average assessment scores, it can also be seen that in general the coordinates for the West Java and Jambi LTPKs' assessment scores are below the diagonal line
This shows that assessments by the LPTK in Jambi were higher than those by the LPTK in West Java
Based on the difference in scores in Table 11 and graphs A1 to A11, it can be concluded that the LPTKs have quite a high level of subjectivity in assessing portfolios
This means that LPTKs tended to have differing assessment standards, and the portfolio results participants received were influenced by which LPTK assessed their portfolios
The LPTK in West Java also acknowledged this difference in scores
When it was asked by another LPTK to assess a portfolio for a particular subject the scores given by the assessors from the two LPTKs differed
2.6 Remedial Training (PLPG) 
2.6.1 PLPG Participants The remedial training aimed to increase teachers' competencies as per the requirements of professional teachers established by law
Remedial training was targeted at certification participants who did not pass directly from the portfolio assessment, and those who did not pass after completing their portfolios with the required documents
In the study areas, the target percentage for remedial training participants for 2007 certification was quite high compared to the total number of participants who submitted portfolios, and ranged from 37% to 90%
The lowest percentage was in Majalengka, West Java, while the highest was in Melawi, West Kalimantan (Table 12)
The high target percentage for remedial training participants has made various parties raise questions, particularly relating to the rather large budget allocated to each PLPG participant
The LPTKs dispute this view because the portfolio assessments were undertaken according to the rules and there was no intention to increase the number of remedial training participants as running the remedial training is quite burdensome and tiring
The number of target remedial training participants who did not undertake the course was relatively small, at less than 1.5% (Table 13)
These participants did not attend the training for unavoidable personal reasons, such as they were performing the hajj, ill, or on maternity leave
Some of the names listed belonged to participants who had passed away
There were also participants who did not attend the remedial training due to work-related reasons, as they were not teaching or had moved to a different kabupaten/kota
Only a very small number of participants refused to attend the training without a clear reason
There were also those who did not attend because of administrative reasons, because they did not receive information about the training, or received the information late
If target participants were not able to attend the remedial training at the start of implementation and if there would be training courses for their subject area in future, they were able to attend the course in the following period
However, if by the final intake they were unable to attend the course, they were deemed to not qualify, and directed to their kabupaten/kota for further instruction
This meant that if they wanted to undertake certification in the following year, they had to repeat the entire process starting from selection by the kabupaten/kota education office
2.6.2 Implementation of the Remedial Training 
The remedial training was run by the LPTKs which did the assessments
Generally the course was run in the provincial capital city and run in several periods depending on the total number of participants
In Jambi 38 participants had to attend the course in Jakarta because the LPTK in Jambi did not run a course relating to their teaching subject
The remedial training was based on the participants' teaching subjects and the level of education at which they taught
There were 20-40 participants per class without differentiating for gender, age, and origin
The training material was communicated by an instructor from the LPTK, and covered four teacher competencies: pedagogical, professional, personal, and social
Individuals and teams of instructors wrote and arranged material into modules by referring to the guide determined by the Consortium for Teacher Certification
The policy on the length of the remedial training course changed in 2007
At the start of implementation, the course was set at six days, or 60 face-to-face hours, consisting of 28 hours of theory and 32 hours of practical teaching
Not long afterwards this changed to be nine days, or 90 hours, with 30 hours allocated to theory and 60 hours to practical teaching
One face-to-face hour was equivalent to 50 minutes
Of the three LPTKs visited, the LPTKs in Jambi and West Java had run the remedial training for 60 hours over seven days
After the change was announced, the LPTK in West Kalimantan then added two days, while the LPTK in West Java did not
The facilities the LPTKs provided for the remedial training varied, but generally they covered the cost of accommodation, food, and materials
In Jambi participants who had just received the 60 hours of training were not given accommodation for the additional two days
Some participants from out of town were placed in lecturers accommodation and student boarding houses which did not have suitable facilities
The training room facilities were generally adequate
In Jambi, only a plywood board separated the training room from the next room, so noise from the next room was clearly heard and disturbed participants' concentration
In West Kalimantan projectors were not provided in all rooms, and participants had to take turns to use them
These conditions certainly influenced the quality of the remedial training
While undertaking the remedial training, generally participants bore the cost of their personal needs and transport from their homes
Sometimes participants also had to spend their own money in photocopying training material or renting computers or typing services
Remedial training participants from several schools in Bekasi did not spend any money on the course because their schools provided between Rp200,000 and Rp350,000 per participant
The remedial training course ended with an examination, consisting of written and practical teaching examinations
The written exam consisted of examinations based on the course material, and a final exam
The examinations on the course material occurred upon completion of each section, and the final exam was given on the final day of the course
Each instructors produced examination questions by referring to the guidelines determined by the Consortium for Teacher Certification
The validity of the examination questions was not examined, but this is planned for certification in 2008
In the practical teaching exam, participants had to perform teaching activities in front of other participants and instructors to assess their skills in communicating material and controlling the class
Participants also received grades from their peers
Assessment was conducted by dividing the class into groups of ten participants (peer groups)
Each participant was asked to rank participants in their group according to their personal and social skills
Participants' final pass score (SAK) for 2007 was calculated as follows
For 2008 certification, the SAK changed to become
In 2007 certification participants were deemed to pass if their SAK was 70 or higher
Participants who did not pass could take a repeat exam twice at most
If after two exams, they still did not pass, participants were sent to the kabupaten/kota education office for further training
In 2008 certification, participants have been deemed to pass if their SAK has been 70 or higher with a SUT of at least 60 and a SUP of at least 70
If the SAK was below 70 because of a low SPF, then participants have been able to take the written and/or practical exam again to raise their SAP
In the study areas remedial training participants generally passed the first examination
Participants usually took the repeat exam because they did not attend the remedial training course in full, i.e came late, and missed some of the daily exams
In Jambi and West Kalimantan there were participants who had to take the repeat exam, but at the time of this study this had not been done
Meanwhile in West Java, all remedial training participants passed, although not all participants had received an official announcement
Participants thought that the remedial training course was very beneficial because they gained knowledge and new skills related to the teaching and learning process
The view that the course was much better than portfolio assessment made certification participants from a senior high school in Muara Jambi intentionally reduce their portfolio scores so that they did not receive pass scores, and could take the remedial course
In terms of the course material provided, participants thought that it was relevant and not too difficult because it related to things they did every day as teachers
Participants also thought that the instructors were very competent both in their mastery of the material as well as in its delivery, because many had doctorate degrees and were even professors
Although in general participants viewed the remedial course positively, they also thought that its timetable, from morning until evening daily, in addition to the various individual assignments, was quite burdensome
In relation to the rule of sending remedial training participants who did not pass the repeat exam back to their kabupaten/kota education office, there were education office officials who said that they were not prepared for this to happen
This was because there were no rules about how to arrange for it
2.7 Pass Rates and the Professional Allowance 
Generally remedial training participants passed, except for a few who had to repeat the examination
This meant that, with the exception of those who did not qualify because they did not fulfill the participant criteria, did not submit a portfolio, or did not attend the remedial training, all 2007 certification participants passed
Because of this, information spread among teachers that eventually all certification participants who fulfilled the criteria would pass, though at different stages in the process
For 2008 certification participants, this was encouragement to undertake certification despite their portfolio scores not being sufficient, as they thought that if they did not pass the portfolio assessment, they could take the remedial training course, which would eventually allow them to pass
However, this raised questions for some teachers who passed directly from the portfolio assessment, particularly because all teachers with various stages of passing were treated the same after they passed
According to the rules, those who pass first should receive the professional allowance earlier
However, at the time of this study none of the 2007 certification participants had received the allowance, so they did not feel any different to participants who had taken the remedial training course
The rules about when participants who pass start to receive the allowance differed in 2007 and 2008 certification
In 2007 certification participants who had passed portfolio assessment before October 2007 were to receive the professional allowance from 1 October 2007, while participants who passed after this date were to receive the allowance starting from the month after they were deemed to pass
According to the 2008 certification guidebooks participants would receive the professional allowance starting from January of the financial year following the year they passed and received their teacher certificate and registration number
The rules about the payment of the allowance in the 2008 guidebooks create inequality, both for teachers who passed in an earlier month or intake but the same year, as well as for teachers who passed in the same intake but a different year
According to the regulations, participants who pass will receive a certificate from the LPTK and a teacher registration number from the Directorate General for PMPTK in MoNE
However, at the time of this study all participants who had passed 2007 certification had not yet received teacher registration numbers because they had not been issued by the Directorate General for PMPTK
A large proportion of participants were also yet to receive certificates from the respective LPTKs because of various technical problems, such as invalid data needing to be verified, and difficulties in fitting the shape and size of letters to be written in the available space on the blank certificates
As specified in the guidebooks, the certificates must be specially printed by the Indonesian Government Security Printing and Minting Corporation (Perusahaan Umum Percetakan Uang)
The only MoNE certification participants who have received certificates are those assessed by the LPTK in West Kalimantan, who passed directly from their portfolios, while a large proportion of MoRA certification participants who passed have already received certificates
When, or after, receiving their certificates, participants from West Kalimantan still faced several problems
Several participants received certificates with the wrong information or typing errors
Although this was not the participants' fault, participants had to pay if they wanted their certificates to be corrected
In Singkawang, participants had to return the original certificates they received to the kota education office for filing and photocopying
In Melawi, one of the best participants from the remedial training course was asked to collect his certificate in the provincial capital and receive the appreciation of the head of the Universitas Tanjungpura, Pontianak
However, it turned out that his certificate was misplaced and could not be collected
although he had already spent a lot of money in transport and wasted several days in attending
In Melawi, participants paid the district education office Rp50,000 for photocopying, legalization, and filing for the professional allowance
According to regulations, teachers who pass certification have the right to receive a professional allowance equivalent to month's wage
Regulations about the payment mechanism were not detailed in the 2007 certification guidebooks
Several regulations and decisions were issued in stages through letters from the Director General for PMPTK to the kabupaten/kota education offices
In 2008 certification, the regulations about the professional allowance was dealt with in greater detail in a specific guidebook for the distribution of the professional allowance
The rules governing the conditions for the receipt of the allowance in 2007 and 2008 were basically the same
Participants who pass have a right to receive the professional allowance on the condition that they have a certificate from the LPTK, have a teacher registration number from the Directorate General for PMPTK, and fulfill a teaching load of at least 24 teaching hours per week
Teachers with particular roles have special teaching workloads
For example, school principals have a teaching load of 6 hours per week and deputy principals 12 hours per week
The allowance will be stopped if a teacher dies, retires, no longer works as a teacher, and ends a work contract with an educational institution, breaks their contract, or is convicted of a criminal act in court
Participants who passed certification needed to submit several documents for the arrangement of the professional allowance
In 2008 certification, a more complete range of documents needed to be submitted
However, the documents were basically the same as those required in 2007, and there is a possibility that even 2007 certification participants will have this rule applied because the distribution of their professional allowances is not complete
Participants needed to collect photocopies of teaching certificates verified by the LPTK which issued them;
photocopies of letters of promotion, periodic pay rises, or certificates for special changes in pay, verified by the school principal (for civil servants);
photocopies of certificates for special changes in position, verified by the school principal and organization (for non-civil servants);
certificates for the allocation of teaching tasks and additional tasks verified by the school principal
certificates for the division of teaching tasks in other schools verified by the school principal;
photocopies of bank account/postal details;
and for school principals and deputy principals, verification by the kabupaten/kota education office
The kabupaten/kota education office would then input this data into its files and send it to the Directorate General for PMPTK as a recommendation for the receipt of the allowance
The Directorate General then issued a directive from the Director General for PMPTK determining the teachers who receive the professional allowance
There were also teachers who had to pay for the arrangement of their teaching certificates and professional allowance
In Bekasi, West Java, there were teachers who paid Rp50,000 when they submitted their professional allowance documents to the kota education office
In Majalengka, West Java, teachers whose professional allowance was held up due to administrative errors had to pay for transport for a representative to travel to the MoNE office in Jakarta several times to resolve the problem
Meanwhile, participants from the LPTK in West Kalimantan had to pay Rp17,500 if typing or printing mistakes on their certificates needed to be rectified
These participants also had to arrange this directly with the LPTK because if they went through the kabupaten education office they would incur higher costs
In West Kalimantan MoRA participants also picked up the cost of verifying ten photocopies of their teaching certificates, which came to Rp50,000
The professional allowance is organized and paid through the relevant certifying organization
The allowance for MoNE participants is paid through MoNE, while MoRA participants are paid by MoRA, even though teachers are under the jurisdiction of MoNE
In 2007, the budget for the professional allowance was managed by the central MoRA and MoNE, but in 2008 has been managed by the provincial government
For MoNE participants the allowance is paid through particular banks, and paid separately to teachers' wages
Although there is no rule that participants must use a certain bank, in several regions it was recommended that participants open accounts in a set bank
Because of this, participants were suspicious that the local education office had collaborated with banks to receive profit through the increase in customers who would pay monthly administration fees
According to the education office, the use of certain banks was recommended to participants to facilitate the distribution of funds
The payment of the professional allowance for MoRA participants was differentiated based on teacher status
The allowance for civil servant teachers was to be distributed with teachers' wages, while for non-civil servant teachers would be paid through an agent
The determination of the agent was left to MoRA's provincial offices (kanwil)
Some offices used post offices as agents, and others used banks
Although all participants have not received registration numbers, and all participants, apart from those in West Kalimantan, have not received certificates, a large proportion of participants from the 2006 MoNE quota have already received the professional allowance
However, the allowance they received was only for the first quarter (October-December 2007), which was paid in January 2008
Between February and July 2008 they did not receive payments, although they should have received two payments for January-March and April- June 2008
Various parties, including the participants, considered this fortunate, because at the time this study was conducted a small number of participants from the 2006 quota had still not received any allowance
Participants from the 2007 and additional 2007 quotas who were actually certified almost together with the 2006 quota, because they were all included as 2007 participants, are also yet to receive a payment at all
For certification through MoRA, only participants from Islamic schools have received the allowance
This was even limited to non-civil servant teachers in Islamic schools who had passed earlier than other participants
Non-civil servant teachers were given the bonus first because their economic welfare is lower than civil servant teachers
However, as for certification through MoNE, they also only received one payment, and have not received any subsequent payments
At the time of this study was conducted it was not clear when the professional allowance would be paid
Even parties considered competent by the participants, such as the kabupaten/kota education and MoRA offices, were not able to provide a reasonable explanation
Even information about the total value of the allowance, when it would start, and the method and frequency of payment was unclear, both for participants and for the kabupaten/kota education and MoRA offices
According to informants MoNE had already distributed the budget for the payment of the professional allowance to the provincial education office's treasury; however, the funds could not be released because there was no payment authorization from the central government
This has influenced participants' and other teachers' trust in certification
Many questioned the government's sincerity in fulfilling its promises
However, despite this, many participants were sure that they would receive their due amount accumulatively, and from the time that they were deemed to pass
There were several cases in the study areas relating to the professional allowance
In Jambi a participant received a double payment for the first quarter
In Majelengka, West Java, in the directive detailing January 2008 allowance recipients 5 of 59 2006 certification participants who passed directly from their portfolios were not listed, and in the directive for March recipients 10 participants were not listed
2.8 Funding 
The certification program is funded through the central and regional government budgets (Anggaran Pendapatan Belanja Negara, or APBN, and Anggaran Pendapatan Belanja Daerah, or APBD), and other official sources
The central government budget supplied funds for LPTKs' certification activities and the payment of the professional allowance
Regional government budgets also funded certification activities related to the roles and functions of provincial government and kabupaten/kota agencies, such as socialization for teachers, the determination of quotas and participants, the collection and distribution of portfolios and coordination
In 2007 certification funds from the central budget were managed by MoNE and MoRA
From 2008 certification, however, funds have been decentralized to the provinces through deconcentrated provincial funds
Funds for 2008 MoNE certification were distributed through LPMP, which then distributed the funds to LPTKs for portfolio assessment and remedial training course costs, and to the provincial education office for the payment of the professional allowance for teachers who passed
Meanwhile, funds for 2008 MoRA certification was distributed directly through MoRA provincial offices
2.8.1 In the LPTKs 
In 2007 certification, LPTKs received funds directly from the central government in block grants, which were managed independently and used to fund all operational certification activities
According to Directorate General for PMPTK in MoNE, LPTKs received Rp2 million per participant, with Rp500,000 allocated to portfolio assessment and Rp1.5 million for remedial training
However, based on data from the financial reports of the LPTKs visited it can be seen that the allocated funds the LPTKs received differed to these amounts, especially the allocation for remedial training activities, as seen in Table 15
The budget each LPTK received varied according to the number of participants each would certify
In the study areas, the LPTK in West Java received the largest budget, with Rp8.08 billion for portfolio assessments and Rp28.69 billion for remedial training
The LPTK in West Kalimantan received Rp1.75 billion for portfolio assessments and Rp7.07 billion for remedial training
The LPTK in Jambi received the smallest budget, at Rp1.37 billion for portfolio assessments and Rp4.79 billion for remedial training activities (see Table 14)
From reports detailing the actual use of funds for three LPTKs in the study areas, it can be seen that the budgets each LPTK received for both portfolio assessments and remedial training were not used in full because there were not as many certification participants as anticipated
Nominally, the unspent funds were largest for the LPTK in West Java, which had Rp791 million in unspent funds for portfolio assessment and Rp6.4 billion in unspent funds for remedial training
Unspent funds were smallest in the LPTK in West Kalimantan, at Rp362 million for portfolio assessment and Rp294 million for remedial training
Based on percentages the largest amount of unspent funds was in the LPTK in West Kalimantan, where 33% of the portfolio assessment budget and 38% of the remedial training budget was unspent
These excess amounts needed to be reported and returned to the central government
If examined in greater detail, in the LPTKs in West Java and Jambi excesses in funds for portfolio assessment only arose for funds relating to the total number of participants, i.e payments to assessors
Meanwhile, other components did not have unspent funds because actual spending was the same as the budgeted amount
In other words, the costs of other components stayed constant, and were not influenced by the total number of participants
This means that if the certification quota is not met then the government loses out because it must still spend the same amount of money, except for payments to assessors
Funds for portfolio assessment were allocated to data processing, provisions for assessors, portfolio assessment, coordination, internal LPTK coordination, stationery and correspondence, and certificates for participants who passed
From Table 14 it can be seen that the largest budgeted and actual expenditure for portfolio assessment was for portfolio assessment itself, which amounted to 79%-82% of budgeted funds, or 75%-81% of actual expenditure
Funds for portfolio assessment were used for stipends and transport for assessors and committee members, accommodation, preparation, and stipends for additional officers
Assessors' stipends was the largest of these components, at 81.8%-82.6% of actual portfolio assessment expenditure, or 60.8%-66.8% of actual overall portfolio assessment expenditure (see Table A1 in Appendix 2 and Table A2 in Appendix 3, which provide the allocated and budgeted expenditure data in detail)
This is in line with the regulation that for every one participant, there are two portfolios which are assessed by two assessors, who each receive Rp150,000 per portfolio (before 15% tax)
This meant that assessors' stipends for each participant came to Rp300,000 or 60% of the Rp500,000 allocated to portfolio assessment
Meanwhile funds for the remedial training course were allocated to three main components-preparation, implementation and reporting to the PLPG
Among other things these three components covered the supply of the training modules and examination questions, coordination of the committee, participants' accommodation, stipends and transport for instructors and committee members, and reporting (see Table A3 in Appendix 4 and Table A4 in Appendix 5)
The biggest allocated and actual expenditure was implementation, which absorbed about 80% of total remedial training funds
Of the implementation funds, the dominant spending component was participant accommodation costs and instructors costs, which included a stipend, transport, and accommodation
In the LPTKs in West Java and West Kalimantan, the actual costs of these components did not differ greatly, however, in the LPTK in Jambi the difference was quite large
For the LPTK in Jambi participant accommodation was 69% and instructors costs only 18% of implementation funds, or 55% and 14% of total remedial training funds respectively
This percentage also differs from the budgeted amount, because each of the components were budgeted to be around 36% and 33% of the total remedial training budget
If the budget and actual expenditure are divided by the total number of participants who participated in the various activities, it can be seen that actual and budgeted expenditure for portfolio assessment and remedial training activities varied between LPTKs
Actual expenditure on portfolio assessment was slightly below the early allocation of Rp500,000 per participant, at Rp407,000 to Rp494,000 per participant
Meanwhile actual remedial training expenditure was quite high, especially in West Java and West Kalimantan, where it reached more than Rp3 million per participant (see Table 15)
Although in total the certification budget provided to LPTKs was sufficient, LPTKs complained that the allocation of the funds did not cover all their requirements, such as the cost of storage of portfolios, which must be stored for at least three years; electricity, fax and telephone expenses, course fees, and the purchase of computers for the committee
Despite this, in the LPTK in West Kalimantan there was expenditure for the purchase of a server and computer set which had not been budgeted for
2.8.2 Funds in the Kabupaten/Kota Education Office and MoRA 
Kabupaten/Kota and Provincial Offices The kabupaten/kota education office and MoRA provincial and kabupaten/kota offices played an important role in implementing certification, 
however, they did not receive special funding from the central government's funds for the program
In relation to the fact that there was no budget, MoNE urged provincial governments to allocate their own budgets to certification activities in their provinces
In implementation, not all provinces supplied a sufficient budget so not all were able to conduct all certification activities, like socialization, consultancy services, and distribution of portfolios, in full
Because of this, the relevant agencies in several regions picked up the costs from participants
2.8.3 Costs at the Participants Level
Based on the above analysis of the stages of the program's implementation, it can be seen that participants paid quite a large amount
Participants paid for activities such as socialization, portfolio compilation, sending the portfolios, taking the remedial training course, and organizing the certificates and professional allowance
The costs varied between participants, both in the nominal amount and in the type of cost
This variation in costs was influenced by each participant's discretion in completing their portfolios, the total number of copies of the portfolio that they made, the level at which other parties were involved, and whether they provided tokens of appreciation to the relevant institutions
The variation in costs was also influenced by the organizations' policies in determining how much participants are levied
In total, each participant paid between Rp150,000 and Rp1.8 million, outside of the costs of taking the remedial training course
2.9 Coordination, Complaints, and Monitoring and Evaluation
Certification operated through two coordination channels, vertical and horizontal coordination
Vertical coordination is a working relationship which has already been institutionalized in one line of a bureaucratic agency
In MoNE certification vertical coordination occurred between the central office, the provincial education office, LPMP, the kabupaten/kota education office, schools, and teachers
In MoRA certification vertical coordination occurred between the Ministry's central office, provincial office, the kabupaten/kota office, schools and teachers
Meanwhile, horizontal coordination is a working relationship between several agencies, like the relationship between MoNE and MoRA; the kabupaten/kota education office, MoRA provincial and kabupaten/kota offices and LPMP; and between these agencies and the LPTK
As a broad outline, coordination between these agencies is illustrated in Figure 1
2.9.1 Vertical Coordination 
Top to bottom intra-agency coordination took the form of policy determination, determination of the quotas and participants, information distribution and socialization
On the other hand bottom to top coordination came in the form of provision of documents and reporting
According to the regulations, teachers needed to submit A1 and A2 forms, portfolios, and allowance documents to the kabupaten/kota education office
The kabupaten/kota education office then submitted the A1 and A2 forms to LPMP, participant summaries to the provincial education office, portfolios to the LPTK, and the allowance documents to MoNE's central office
Furthermore, the provincial education office submitted a province-wide participant summary for reporting to the Consortium for Teacher Certification, while LPMP sent the A1 and A2 forms to the Directorate General for PMPTK 
Coordination activities in MoRA certification were almost the same as under MoNE
In the study areas vertical coordination operated quite well, although there were several problems, particularly relating to data, policy, and shortcuts in coordination channels
Problems with data can be seen from the inaccuracy, incompleteness, and inconsistency in the teacher data available in every associated agency from the central government level to the kabupaten/kota level
This was partly caused by late reporting and data which was not updated or verified
Policy problems were evident from the varied financial support provided by regional governments
The central government urged regional governments to provide special funds for certification activities, 
but not all regions did so, so some certification activities were not able to be carried out in full
Policy problems can also be seen from the delay in the payment of the professional allowance
Although the professional allowance funds for 2007 participants had been distributed to the regions, the funds had not been distributed to participants because at the time this study was conducted, MoNE or MoRA had no further policy on it
Meanwhile, the problem of shortcuts in coordination channels can be seen in the fact that there are agencies which are part of coordination channels but are not being involved
In Jambi, officials from MoRA's provincial office confessed that they had never received copies of letters, let alone reports from both the Ministry's kabupaten/kota offices and the central office, so they did not have a clear understanding of certification activities in the field
In West Java, the kabupaten/kota education office also tended to have a direct relationship with MoNE's central office, without going through the provincial education office, especially in arranging various matters relating to the professional allowance
The opposite occurred in West Kalimantan, where MoRA's kabupaten/kota offices were not fully involved in the certification process because certification participants and the LPTK had a direct relationship with the MoRA provincial office
In addition to coordination between implementing agencies, there was also coordination between implementing agencies, school principals, and participants
School principals and the kabupaten/kota education and MoRA offices worked together in communicating information and data, and recommending potential certification participants
At the school level, school principals also worked with teachers in communicating information and recommending teachers for certification
However, not all school principals were able to perform the coordination function well because there was a view that certification activities were the responsibility of individual teachers who could deal directly with the UPTD or kabupaten/kota education office
Coordination at the school level was also affected by the fact that some school principals had not been certified, so their knowledge of the program was limited
In a small number of cases, coordination at the school level was affected as well by the poor relationship between teachers and principals
Appraisals by superiors tended to be subjective because superiors tried to make their staff appear to be teachers who could pass certification
There were even cases where the school principal signed appraisal forms in which participant had filled in the scores themselves
The same occurred in the provision of recommendations from relevant agencies
Coordination between participants, the education office or MoRA kabupaten/kota office, and the UPTD was quite intensive
Many teachers visited or contacted the kabupaten/kota education or MoRA office to ask questions about various matters, such as their participation status, requests for inspector appraisals, verification of academic qualifications, the arrangement of the portfolio, their pass status, and the arrangements for the professional allowance
In addition to contacting the kabupaten/kota education office, participants from pre-schools and primary schools also contacted the UPTD about several of the matters above, with the exception of verification of academic qualifications
In Kota Jambi, the number of participants coming to the education office during teaching hours prompted the kota education office to issue a circular prohibiting teachers from coming to the office during teaching hours, so that they did not disrupt the teaching and learning process
In Melawi, West Kalimantan, teachers only went to the UPTD to ask for inspector appraisals, and contacted the kabupaten/kota education office for other certification activities
In addition to going to the kabupaten/kota education or MoRA office, participants in Jambi and West Kalimantan also sought information and documents relating to the professional allowance from the Ministries' provincial offices
2.9.2 Horizontal Coordination 
Generally horizontal coordination faced more obstacles than vertical coordination
This was not only because horizontal coordination involves differing departments or agencies in differing bureaucracies but also because interagency ego and individual priorities worsen coordination
Horizontal coordination between MoNE, MoRA, and LPTKs at the central level occurred under the coordination of the Consortium for Teacher Certification
In general MoNE and MoRA worked together in determining MoRA certification procedures, which were required to be in accordance with the procedures determined by MoNE
For 2008 certification, the two ministries coordinated socialization for MoRA provincial and kabupaten/kota offices for certification of religion teachers in public schools
In addition to this the two ministries also worked together to determine the channel through which religion teachers in public schools and general subject teachers in Islamic schools should be certified, which was agreed in a joint circular
It was important that horizontal coordination between MoNE and MoRA occurred at the kabupaten/kota level, because it involved the determination of certification participants
In the study areas this coordination did not run smoothly, and it can even be said that it did not occur at all
The worst thing about this was that it was accompanied by a lack of understanding by agencies about the rules for distributing participants between the two implementing channels, and led to cases where participants were directed to the wrong channel, as detailed in subchapter 2.1 about implementing organizations
At the provincial level, horizontal coordination occurred between the provincial education office and LPMP in implementing socialization of the program and in counting and determining the kabupaten/kota quotas, with the involvement of the kabupaten/kota education office
In 2008 certification, the two institutions also coordinated the release of funds for the payment of the professional allowance, because the government gave these funds to the kabupaten/kota offices through the LPMP
In addition to the provincial education office, LPMP also coordinated the issuing of the NUPTKs with kabupaten/kota MoRA offices
MoRA kabupaten/kota offices distributed A1 and A2 forms to teachers, then collected and sent the completed forms to LPMP as a basis for creating the NUPTKs
MoRA kabupaten/kota offices complained that fewer of their teachers had NUPTKs than MoNE teachers
Because of this there was suspicion that MoRA teachers were discriminated against because LPMP was dominated by the education office
According the LPMP office in Jambi, the large number of MoRA teachers without NUPTKs was due to the fact that very few of these teachers completed and returned the forms distributed by LPMP
As an implementing organization the LPTK undertook coordination with MoNE and MoRA through the Consortium for Teacher Certification, including reporting on portfolio assessment and remedial training
These reports also needed to be forwarded to MoNE or MoRA provincial and kabupaten/kota offices
From 2008 certification, the LPTKs also coordinated contract and funding matters with the education office or the provincial MoRA office
The LPTKs also worked with kabupaten/kota education or MoRA offices on matters relating to portfolio submission and the announcement of certification results, particularly participants' pass statuses
Announcements about participants' pass statuses were usually made by the kabupaten/kota education or MoRA offices through official letters
In several regions announcements were also posted in the various offices and participants were contacted by telephone and told to view the announcement, or told their status directly
LPTKs were not permitted to contact participants directly, in order to maintain the objectivity of their assessments
However, there were several cases of participants trying to contact the LPTK directly in relation to the submission of their portfolios, their results from the remedial training course, and their certificates
In dealing with this, some LPTKs directed participants to the kabupaten/kota education or MoRA office
However, other LPTKs were more open and even provided a special telephone number which participants could use to contact them, as was the case in West Kalimantan
In addition to undertaking coordination with other parties, parent and partner LPTKs also undertook internal coordination in forming the certification committee and in implementing certification
Some partner LPTKs complained that the parent LPTK was more dominant because the many decisions relating to certification were made unilaterally by the parent LPTK without involving partner LPTKs
In addition a very small proportion of lecturers from the partner LPTKs became committee members, assessors, or instructors
2.9.3 Complaints 
As an information service and means of accountability, Directorate General for PMPTK staff opened a community information service through a Community Information Unit (UPM), which was also able to be a place for complaints and their resolution
Information about the existence of this unit, which was located in Jakarta, was only communicated in the guidebook provided for implementing organizations; there was no mention of it in the portfolio compilation guidebook, which was widely distributed and accessed by teachers
Because of this, teachers and the community generally did not know that the UPM existed so information about deception or underhand activities circulated in the community without any formal complaints and actions to address them
Education office officials were also unaware of the existence of the UPM, and as such thought that complaints from teachers or other parties related to certification could be passed on to the implementing committee in the relevant education or MoRA office
However, the problem was that if the deception involved those offices, the resolution of the complaint would be questionable and teachers would be scared to complain out of fear that it would have an impact on their certification results
Some teachers thought that the Teachers' Association of the Republic of Indonesia (PGRI), as a teacher association, could handle and follow up on complaints
However, its independence is questionable, as in several areas the head of the Association was appointed by the head of the education office or one of its divisions, or the kabupaten/kota office
The same occured for the education board
Although the head of the education board was not usually an education office official, the board's office is usually located within the education office
Some informants suggested that a new independent body, or an existing independent body, should be given the task of monitoring certification and receiving and acting upon complaints
2.9.4 Monitoring and Evaluation 
Monitoring activities were only dealt with in general in the certification guidebooks, and were limited to the determination of certification participants
This monitoring was conducted by elements at the central level and used funds from the central Budget Implementation List (DIPA)
In the study areas, the only institutions subject to monitoring activities were the LPTKs
Monitoring was conducted by a monitoring team appointed by the central government
Monitoring covered portfolio assessment, the remedial training course, and the use of the budget allocated to the LPTKs
Meanwhile MoNE and MoRA provincial and kabupaten/kota offices, schools and teachers have not been subject to monitoring activities
Several schools in the sample had only been questioned by inspectors, but this was not conducted as a special monitoring activity and was only part of routine inspections
The 2008 certification guidebooks mention the need for broader monitoring and evaluation (monev) activities for overall program management
Monev could be done in an integrated way across all the levels of the education office, starting from the Directorate General for PMPTK, to LPMP, the provincial education office, and the kabupaten/kota education offices, according to their respective tasks and responsibilities
The monev activities mentioned in the guidebooks appear to be proposals only and are not binding, very general, and not specific about how they would be conducted and their funding sources, so their implementation is questionable
The 2008 guidebooks also specify the system of monitoring for participants who received the professional allowance
In order to receive the allowance participants needed to provide several documents, including files on their obligatory work hours, verified by the school principal
The school principal then needed to investigate the validity of all the required files
Furthermore the kabupaten/kota education office would check, and if necessary, verify the documents
In addition every month the school principal needed to also monitor and report on changes in teachers' status or conditions, and the kabupten/kota education office needed to recheck this data every three months based on the principals' reports
The monitoring system for participants who receive the allowance only related to employment status and working hours
Data on teachers' quality or competency (pedagogical, professional, personal, and social skills), which were elements of the assessment, were not included
Many informants thought that monev activities for these four competencies were important because it would ensure that the aim of teacher certification, to increase the quality of teachers and education in general, would be met
It is also important that the requirement about teaching hours is monitored because according to many informants it was very easily manipulated, if teachers collaborated with the school principal
III IMPACTS OF THE PROGRAM 
According to the guidebooks teacher certification is an attempt to increase the quality and welfare of teachers, and also acts to increase the status and role of teachers as agents of learning
It is hoped that teacher certification will increase the quality of learning and education in a sustainable way
At the time this study was conducted the program outcomes were hard to gauge because teacher certification was a newly implemented program
Despite this, based on the results of in-depth interviews with informants, the research team obtained an overall picture of the direct and indirect impacts of the teacher certification program, both those which have occurred and those expected to occur
3.1 Impacts on Increasing Teachers' Welfare 
In an attempt to fulfill the program's goals, teacher certification is accompanied by the provision of a professional allowance
Because of this, normatively, certification will increase the income of teachers who pass to the value of one month's salary
Once they receive the allowance, civil servant teachers will receive an additional Rp1 million so in total their monthly income will be between Rp3 million and Rp5 million
Most informants felt certain that teachers' welfare would increase as a result of the increase in income
However, a small proportion of informants were uncertain that teachers' welfare would increase because of the increase in expenses as a result of fuel price hikes
Despite this all teachers welcomed the allowance and hoped to receive it because at the very least it would reduce their financial burdens
The professional allowance has also become the main incentive for teachers to undertake certification
3.2 Impacts in Increasing the Quality of Teachers and Education
3.2.1 For Participant Teachers 
It is hoped that the provision of the professional allowance will motivate teachers to improve their quality and professionalism
However, in general informants questioned this
Some informants thought that the increase in income might increase the quality of teachers because teachers would not be forced to seek additional income elsewhere
It is hoped that the increase in income will not only raise the welfare and status of teachers, but also encourage teachers to focus more on their work and on personal development, and increase the quality of their teaching so they become truly professional teachers
Despite this, other informants were not certain that an increase in financial well-being would increase the quality of teachers
They were convinced that increasing quality and productivity was a matter of teachers' personal commitment
In the past teachers had received pay rises, both through general wage rises as well as promotions, but the effect of these pay rises on performance is unclear and uneven
Generally teachers were not certain that certification would increase the quality of teachers and general education
This is because the program was not designed to capture or identify the best teachers, which were hoped would encourage quality education
Deception was also common in the creation of the portfolios, so the portfolios submitted did not reflect the actual quality of the teachers
The fact that there were participants who falsified portfolio documents has created the view that certification did not motivate teachers to improve their performance but rather, encouraged them to be dishonest
It was also thought that the operation of certification through portfolio assessment would not increase the quality of teachers because only pre-existing administrative documents are assessed
Some informants even thought that the certification program as currently implemented does not have a clear framework
If certification is intended to increase teachers' welfare then the program should be made simpler without conditions or stipulations which make it difficult for teachers
On the other hand if certification aims to increase the quality of teachers, a more suitable implementation mechanism would be intensive education and training
The remedial training course which is currently part of the teacher certification program is considered good; however, it is only able to refresh, not increase, teachers' knowledge
3.2.2 Impacts on Non-participant Teachers 
The impact of the program on teachers who have not yet undertaken certification is potentially quite large
Teachers who have not fulfilled the requirement of having an undergraduate degree have been encouraged to continue their studies at the undergraduate level
The government, through laws relating to education, had already made it compulsory for teachers to have a minimum of an undergraduate degrees from 2005, but the push to fulfill this requirement has only gained momentum since the teacher certification program came into existence
Through the provision of the professional allowance, the certification program is thought to have increased the prestige of the teaching profession
In turn, it is hoped that this will encourage the best students to become teachers, and so increase the quality of teachers and education in general
Informants from education bodies, kabupaten/kota education offices, and the LPTKs acknowledge that there has been an increase in the total number of teachers, or high school graduates taking undergraduate teaching degrees, both by correspondence and in regular universities
This can be seen in the significant increase in the number of people interested in studying in the teaching and education faculties since 2007
Universities have accommodated this increase by implementing long distance classes and opening new disciplines of study
Certification has made teachers more disciplined in filing various documents
It has also encouraged teachers to be more active in participating in education-related activities like training, student counseling, additional lessons, and school administration
By participating in these activities teachers receive documents or certificates which can be used in their portfolios
Many teachers were motivated to participate in commercial seminars, although they had to pay
One informant has even participated in six seminars since the end of 2007
However, many teachers who attended seminars did so only to obtain certificates, so the effects of these seminars on increasing the knowledge and quality of teachers is doubtful
3.3 Other Impacts 
Teacher certification has also had other impacts
These impacts include increased opportunities for various parties to gain profit
Lecturers who became committee members, assessors or remedial training instructors received additional income from certification
Many institutions have been encouraged to run commercial education seminars and charge participants
In Jambi, for example, an independent institute worked with local education offices to run socialization activities in every kabupaten/kota at a cost of Rp125,000 per participant
Many seminars of this type were held in urban areas, particularly in Java, to the point where a kabupaten or kota could have seminars once a fortnight, or at least once a month
Teachers were interested in participating because they could receive certificates for their portfolios
One educational institute, which held a seminar at the kecamatan level in Majalengka, had to provide additional emergency tents because there were so many attendees
There is even information that at a seminar in Bekasi the number of participants exceeded the venue's capacity, so some participants were not able to attend and only obtained certificates which were distributed several days later
The appeal of these seminars has made several parties considered competent in certification become speakers
An informant in West Java confessed that in 2008 he had been a speaker 11 times in certification-related seminars run by various organizations
Informants were willing to become speakers because they felt obligated to disseminate clear and accurate information about the certification program
The misuse of the mechanism and requirements of certification also had other impacts
A small proportion of teachers did not have the opportunity, were not able, or did not want to create portfolios and the required documents independently, which encouraged the emergence of false document services, especially for lesson planning documents, and fee-forportfolio services
The nontransparent and invalid method of determining participants in some areas has also created jealousy between teachers, particularly on the part of senior teachers who fulfill the certification qualifications and criteria but who have not been summoned to participate
Jealousy also arose from long-standing, well performing teachers, who had even became deputy or school principals, but who did not have an undergraduate degree
This jealousy was not only due to the professional allowance received by teachers who passed, but also due to the acknowledgement and higher prestige the teachers received through the teacher certificate issued by the LPTK
Despite this, the problem was addressed through Government Regulation No 74, 2008, which states that during a five year transition period teachers aged over 50 years, who have more than 20 years' work experience, and who have a ranking of IVa but who do not have a four year diploma or undergraduate degree may undertake certification through portfolio assessment
Based on the regulations, certification participants and professional allowance recipients must have a minimum teaching load of 24 hours per week
According to informants, this regulation was not burdensome because teachers teach for five hours per day at a school that runs classes five days per week, or four hours per day at a school that runs classes six days per week
However, in several schools this requirement was hard to fulfill because of the disproportionate number of teachers and classes
As such this requirement has encouraged teachers with a shortage in teaching hours to seek additional teaching hours in other schools
Several cases have occurred in the study areas, including the following
a) In Kota Jambi, teachers who sought additional teaching hours in another school were not paid or paid only token amounts
This was thought to influence the quality of learning and teaching
There were also schools who tried to increase the number of classes and student intake
b) In Singkawang, West Kalimantan, some schools ran teaching teams for certain subjects, where one class was taught by two teachers
In some areas, teaching in other schools was difficult because of the limited number of schools needing additional teachers
As a result, some informants thought that there would be attempts to manipulate data on teaching hours involving teachers, school principals, and the kabupaten/kota education office
It was also thought that the requirement would reduce the role of temporary teachers, who are paid by their school or by the local government
On the whole, the requirement that teachers who pass certification teach a minimum of 24 hours per week is very important as it seeks to ensure that teachers demonstrate commitment to the profession by working intensively with students
This requirement also seeks to encourage teachers to move to areas with a shortage of teachers, and attempts to control costs
However, because it is difficult for some teachers to fulfill this requirement, it should be implemented in conjunction with supporting policies
In the short term, teachers need to be given other opportunities to teach in activities or programs that are acknowledged by the government
In the long term, policies to even out the number of teachers in different regions and different schools must be implemented consistently and continuously
IV RECOMMENDATIONS 
Based on the research findings, the following are several recommendations to increase the program's effectiveness in future
1 There needs to be a wider distribution of clear and consistent information about the division of authority between MoNE and MoRA, both for implementing organizations as well as teachers
This must be supported by good coordination and the two organizations should use similar standards in implementing the program, especially in the determination of participants
2 Socialization for participants needs to be done at the lower government level, at the kabupaten/kota level as a minimum
Socialization needs to consider the total number of participants so that information dissemination is more effective and does not burden participants
The information disseminated should at least cover participant requirements and criteria, the method of arranging and assessing portfolios, and the procedure for the payment of the professional allowance
3 Certification information should be given to non-participant teachers so that they have the same knowledge and perceptions of certification, and are encouraged to add to their qualifications
This can also reduce the possibility of jealousy between teachers
The general community also needs to obtain information so that people are more interested in the teaching profession
This can be done through the distribution of brochures and mass media advertising
The teacher certification website should be widely promoted and must also provide broader and more complete information
4 Transparency needs to be improved in several phases of the certification process
The determination of the kabupaten/kota quotas at the provincial level requires a transparent control mechanism and greater involvement of kabupaten/kota education offices to mitigate the risk of deception at the provincial level
5 To maintain objectivity in the determination of participants, the selection criteria must be transparent and the ranked list teachers who fulfill the criteria should be easily accessed by teachers, for example, displayed on information boards of agencies at the kabupaten/kota and kecamatan (subdistrict) levels
6 The provision of authority to the kabupaten/kota education office to distribute the quota between civil servant and non-civil servant teachers should be followed by requirements which guarantee transparency and objectivity to mitigate the risk of deception
7 To avoid unfilled quotas, participants need to be given enough time (at least two weeks) to arrange their portfolios
8 The use of NUPTK data as the basis for determining the quotas and participants is still preemptive as there are many teachers who fulfill the participant requirements but who do not yet have NUPTKs
To avoid such cases of unfairness, the use of NUPTK data should not be forced before all teachers, or as a minimum, those who fulfill the participant criteria, have a NUPTK
9 Stricter and more detailed assessment standards must be set for portfolio components so as to reduce the subjectivity of the assessors
The results of portfolio assessments should be made available in a transparent and easily accessible way to participant teachers, both through announcements on the website as well as through circulars to agencies at the kabupaten/kota level
10 The weightings of the respective components also needs to be reconsidered so that greater value is placed on teacher performance, such as by increasing the weighting of the professional development component, not prioritizing documents which are formalities, and not allowing participants with low scores to automatically take the remedial training
11 There needs to be a longer, more intensive form of training with more in-depth material to ensure the quality of participants who take the PLPG
The assessment of whether participants pass must be performed objectively, using strict pass levels, and participants who do not pass should not automatically become certification participants the following year
12 There needs a mechanism which can ensure the punctuality of payment of the professional allowance, which can be supported by a number of things, including the provision of procedures for the administration of the payment which are simple, practical, and which can guarantee the accuracy of recipients' data
13 Control mechanisms for certification implementation must be optimized, including by having existing monitoring institutions, implementing institutions, and independent institutions conduct staged monitoring
The existence of a complaints body should be communicated widely and at the various government levels, with a clear complaints resolution mechanism
In addition, there must be strict sanctions for the various forms of deception which occur
14 To better ensure that the objective of certification, to increase the quality of teachers and education, is met, the performance of teachers who pass certification should be assessed periodically based on their pedagogical, professional, personal, and social skills
15 Committee members should not have dual roles as assesors or instructurs because committee members perform routine tasks and have rather heavy workloads
This needs to be supported by the provision of incentives for committee members equal to the incentives for assessors and instructors
I BACKGROUND 
Poverty reduction programs are continuously encouraged by various parties, both by the government and nongovernment institutions
In order for these programs to successfully achieve their objectives, area targeting is crucial
To date, reliable regional poverty data with a national scope is only available down to the provincial and district/city levels
As an effort to provide poverty data at the subdistrict and village levels, SMERU and Statistics Indonesia (BPS) with the support of the World Bank have tried to estimate poverty rates at the subdistrict and village levels in three provinces, namely DKI (Special District Capital of) Jakarta, East Java, and East Kalimantan
Poverty rates were estimated by processing the data available in the Household Consumption Module of the 1999 National Socioeconomic Survey (Susenas), the 1999 Core Module of Susenas, the 2000 Village Potential (Podes) data, and the 2000 Population Census conducted by BPS
Following a successful trial, SMERU with the support of the Ford Foundation had continued the calculation of poverty rates at the subdistrict and village levels in other provinces throughout Indonesia
The poverty rate calculations have resulted in a poverty map of Indonesia that covers the subdistrict and village levels, the map is presented in the form of an interactive CD and has been distributed to various stakeholders since the beginning of 2005
In order to find out the uses of the poverty mapping CD, SMERU conducted a brief review by interviewing various stakeholders who have received the interactive CD
II OBJECTIVES 
The objectives of this review are to
discover how stakeholders have used the Poverty Map of Indonesia 2000 CD; 
and obtain feedback which can be used to improve the appearance of the Poverty Map of Indonesia 2000 CD
III METHODOLOGY 
This brief review was conducted qualitatively
The information was gathered from various respondents through interviews using question guidelines or questionnaires
Three approaches were used for the interviews, namely
direct interview; telephone interview; and questionnaire dissemination via email
Respondents were generally individuals or representatives of various institutions that had received the Poverty Map of Indonesia 2000 CD from SMERU seminars, from SMERU staff, through requests via telephone, mail, or email, direct request during a visit to the SMERU office, or from other institutions
Respondents were traced back through attendance lists containing the participants of SMERU seminars who received the CD
In addition, the respondents were traced back through the snowballing method, that is, based on information from various parties and respondents who had been interviewed previously
This study was conducted over roughly three months
Preparation (formulation of TOR and question guidelines), tracing back respondents, and information collection were conducted from August to September 2006, 
while the processing of information and the brief report writing was carried out in January 2007
The report will be presented with brief explanations on simple tabulation results regarding the number of respondents, how the respondents obtained the CD, how the respondents were involved in the dissemination of the CD, the types of uses of the CD, how often respondents accessed the CD content, the problems respondents have faced when opening and using the CD, and respondent feedback for possible improvements to the CD
IV RESULTS OF THE REVIEW 
SMERU has distributed more than 400 Poverty Map of Indonesia 2000 CDs since early 2005
The total number of distributed CDs differs from the number of institutions/individuals receiving the CD as some institutions/individuals requested more than one CD
SMERU was able to contact 126 CD recipients, from which 69 people stated that they have used the CD while the other 57 people had not
The respondents who use the CD stated a number of reasons that had spurred their interest in using the CD, namely
(1) the CD provides detailed poverty information down to the village level; (2) the content of the CD is suitable for their needs; (3) the CD presents poverty information in the form of a map so that it is easy to understand and it makes it possible for a quick search for poor areas; and (4) the program has an interesting appearance, is easy to understand, informative, and systematic in its structure
Those who had not used the CD gave several reasons for not using it, including that the data used in the program is already outdated so they are concerned that the map does not provide a picture of the current poverty condition or because they have not been doing any activities that require the information available in the CD
The following discussions are based on the information from the respondents who have used the CD
The respondents who use the CD come from various organizational backgrounds including government agencies at the central level, regional governments, universities and research institutes, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), companies or business associations, donors or international partnership projects, other institutions, and individuals
Although almost all respondents came from certain institutions, an institutional approach was not always adopted because in some cases different users from the same institution use the CD for different purposes
As a result some institutions appear more than once
Table 1, which presents the number of respondents using the CD classified by institutional background, shows that most institutions/individuals that use the CD are NGOs (26%), government agencies at the central level (23%), donors or international partnership projects (19%), and universities and research institutes (16%)
The respondents using the CD obtained the CD in a number of ways (see Table 2), 
Since there are respondents that have more than one CD, they obtain CD more than one way,
but most commonly when attending SMERU seminars (67%)
A number of respondents acquired the CD from a SMERU staff member (7%), some obtained it when they requested it during a visit to SMERU or via telephone/mail/email (19%), while others obtained it from other institutions 13%
The respondents who requested the Poverty Map of Indonesia 2000 interactive CD via telephone/mail/email had received information about it from other parties prior to ordering it
The fact that information concerning the availability of the CD was spread by word of mouth was confirmed by most respondents (71%), who said they informed other parties about the CD
Many respondents (25%) gave the CD to other parties
Some of them gave out a copy that they requested from SMERU
Others duplicated the CD that they received from SMERU by themselves
Two NGOs even duplicated the CD in quite large numbers to be distributed to their network and use as training material
Some respondents (4%) lent their CD to other parties
They informed other parties about the CD and either lent or gave them the CD because they think the CD is interesting and the information available in the CD can be used by many parties
The interactive CD of Poverty Map of Indonesia 2000 is used for varying purposes
Some respondents have used it for several purposes and have plans to make use of for even more
In total, there are 106 kinds of use
When grouped, the most common use is for referencing, be it for reports, papers, articles, or books (27%)
Other uses include for targeting areas where programs or activities are to be implemented (21%) and for materials used in presentations, discussions, training programs, and advocacy (16%)
Table 3 shows the details of the number uses for the CD classified by type of use
In order to use the CD, the respondents of course have to open the program and read the content
The frequency of opening the program varies between respondents and this is possibly influenced by the types of uses
Most respondents (59%) admitted that they opened the program quite often or had done so at least four times
Around 17% of the respondents had opened the program three times, 15% of the respondents had opened it twice, and only 9% of the respondents once (see Table 4)
The respondents who often opened the program usually used it for a number of purposes or for one purpose requiring meticulous detail, such as for writing materials, targeting locations for program implementation, for analysis, and program implementation
Those who only opened the program once usually used the CD as a reference for comparison with other data or for presentation materials
Almost all respondents (90%) did not experience any problems when operating the program
They acknowledged that it was easy to understand the menu and the available data
The rest of the respondents (10%) admitted that they had experienced a problem with the CD, for example, the CD could not be opened, there was a mismatch between the computer specifications required to open the CD and their computer specifications, it was difficult to understand the menu or data, and it was difficult to open a certain area in the map
The majority of respondents (88%) offered suggestions for how the CD could be improved, while the rest (12%) did not give any suggestions at all, either because they already consider the CD to be good or because they did not offer any feedback
Some of the respondents gave more than one suggestion, so there are 93 suggestions in total
Table 5 shows the kinds of suggestions conveyed by the respondents
Some of the suggestions given by the respondents will be implemented to improve the appearance of the program and the distribution of the CD
However, the suggestion regarding the updating of the map which was conveyed by many respondents cannot be implemented at this time because updated data is not available
The next available data on the population census results, for example, cannot be obtained before 2010 as the population census in Indonesia is only conducted once every 10 years and the last census was conducted in 2000
