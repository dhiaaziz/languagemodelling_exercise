Driving a huge truck over the icy roads of northern Alaska would seem to be a task that requires a sense of humor
But when one driver heard another driver named Alex laugh often and rather loudly over the truck-to-truck communication system, he grew irritated
So he made some disparaging remarks about Alex and his good-natured guffaws
Not long after that, the critical driver lost control of his big rig and ended up in a ditch, up to his axles in snow
And guess who came along the isolated road and saw his predicament
Keep on trucking right past with a hearty laugh at the other guy's trouble
That's not what Alex did
He stopped and spent several hours helping dig his critic out
When he was done, he simply said, 'Any opportunity I can have to make amends, I'm happy to do it.'
And then, of course, he laughed
What a lesson for all of us
Isn't that what Christ commanded us to do in Luke 6, to help out even those who seem to be our enemies
The next time someone says something about you that you don't like, think of Alex, and don't just laugh it off
Do something positive for that person, and in so doing, you may make a friend.
Happy New Year
Looking forward to what this new year might bring, I can't help but wonder if 2012 will be the year when Jesus comes back
But then I also wonder if I'm ready
All of my life I've had to 'be ready.'
As a child, I had to be ready for dinner by washing my hands
As an adult, being ready for important responsibilities continues to be an ongoing reality
But I've come to realize that nothing is more important than being ready for our reunion with Jesus
Speaking of Christ's return, John tells us that 'everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself'
Looking forward to Jesus' return fills us with hope, not a wish-list kind of hope, but a solid expectation that motivates us to keep our hearts from sinful distractions and rivets our attention on becoming more like Him
If we really believe that this might be the year of His return, we will be more ready to forgive, to seek forgiveness, and to share God's unconditional love with others
As we consider the possibility that Jesus could return this year, let's be sure that we are ready
Let's strive to be pure as He is pure, anticipating the day when tears and sorrow, pain and death will all be replaced with the everlasting joy of His presence.
Not long ago, I passed a milestone marking 20 years since I began keeping a spiritual journal
As I reread my first few entries, I was amazed I ever kept it up
But now you couldn't pay me to stop
Here are some benefits I have received from journaling: From life experiences, I see that progress and failure are both part of the journey
I'm reminded of God's grace when I read how He helped me to find a solution to a major problem
I gain insight from past struggles that help with issues I am currently facing
And, most important, journaling shows me how God has been faithfully working in my life
Many of the psalms are like a spiritual journal
They often record how God has helped in times of testing
In Psalm 40, David writes: 'I waited patiently for the Lord; and He inclined to me, and heard my cry
He also brought me up out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my steps'
Later, David needed only to read that psalm to be reminded of God's faithful deliverance
Journaling may be useful to you too
It can help you see more clearly what God is teaching you on life's journey and cause you to reflect on God's faithfulness.
For the past several years, my daughter Rosie has been the director of drama at a local middle school
Students come to audition and a few are selected to play the lead roles
But there are still many other important supporting roles that must be cast, roles that are vital to the production
There are other young people who want to be a part of the show but don't relish being in the spotlight
They are the ones who will change scenery, open and close the curtains, run the lights, and assist with makeup and costume changes
Then there are the parents from the community who provide pizza and cookies for rehearsals, donate goods, build sets, sew costumes, make signs, and hand out programs
The success of the performances are the culmination of an intense 4- to 5-month process that is dependent on the hard work of a wide range of dedicated volunteers
Similarly, for the body of Christ to function fully, each of us must play a part
Every believer is uniquely gifted for service
When these gifts are combined in a cooperative relationship, 'every part does its share'
and the separate parts make up the whole
We need each other
What part are you playing in the life of the church?
Life in our world can be difficult
At some point, most of us have wondered, Where is God in my trouble
And we may have thought, It seems like injustice is winning and God is silent
We have a choice as to how we respond to our troubles
The prophet Habakkuk had an attitude worth following: He made the choice to rejoice
Habakkuk saw the rapid increase in Judah's moral and spiritual failings, and this disturbed him deeply
But God's response troubled him even more
God would use the wicked nation of Babylon to punish Judah
Habakkuk did not fully understand this, but he could rejoice because he had learned to rely on the wisdom, justice, and sovereignty of God
He concluded his book with a wonderful affirmation: 'Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation'
Though it was not clear how Judah would survive, Habakkuk had learned to trust God amid injustice, suffering, and loss
He would live by his faith in God alone
With this kind of faith came joy in God, despite the circumstances surrounding him
We too can rejoice in our trials, have surefooted confidence in God, and live on the heights of His sovereignty.
In the International Slavery Museum in Liverpool, England, the devastation of generations of enslaved men, women, and children is remembered
The price innocent people have paid for the greed of others is horrific, but theirs is not the only cost
Engraved in a wall of the museum is a profound observation made by Frederick Douglass, former slave and crusader for human rights, which reads, 'No man can put a chain about the ankle of his fellow man without at last finding the other end fastened about his own neck.'
In the act of dehumanizing others, we dehumanize ourselves
The apostle Paul put it another way when he wrote, 'Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap'
Paul's words form a stark reminder to us that our choices have consequences, and that includes how we choose to treat others
When we choose to hate, that hate can return to us in the form of consequences that we can never fully prepare for
We can find ourselves alienated from others, angry with ourselves, and hamstrung in our ability to serve Christ effectively
Instead, let's choose 'not [to] grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap
As we have opportunity, let us do good to all'
Roger lost his job due to the company being downsized
For months he searched, applied for jobs, prayed, asked others to pray, and trusted God
Roger and his wife Jerrie's emotions fluctuated though
They saw God provide for them in unexpected ways and experienced His grace, but sometimes they worried that a job would never come
For 15 long months, they waited
Then Roger had three interviews with a company, and a week later the employment agency called and said, 'Have you heard the saying,
Well, you've got the job!'
Jerrie told me later, 'We wouldn't trade this hard experience for anything
It brought us closer together and closer to the Lord.'
Friends who had prayed rejoiced and gave thanks to God
Paul wanted the Corinthian church to see the grace of God at work in his life, which could cause 'thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God'
His trials were so severe that he was hard pressed on every side,'perplexed,'persecuted,' and 'struck down'
Yet he encouraged the people not to lose heart in troubles but to trust God
During our difficulties, we can be drawn nearer to God and others, as Roger and Jerrie experienced, and praise will go to the Lord for His grace.
If you really want to get folks upset, threaten their economy
A bad economic picture gets politicians voted out of office, and the threat of a downturn nearly got the apostle Paul kicked out of Ephesus
Here's what happened
Paul came to town and started 'reasoning and persuading concerning the kingdom of God'
For more than 2 years he shared the gospel, and many began following Jesus
Because Paul was so successful in getting people to see that there is only one true God, many Ephesians stopped worshiping the goddess Diana
This was bad news for the local silversmiths, who made their living creating and selling Diana statuettes
If enough people stopped believing in her, business would dry up
A commotion and an uproar broke out when the craftsmen figured this out
This Ephesus incident can remind us to evaluate our reasons for worshiping God
The silversmiths wanted to protect their worship as a way of protecting their prosperity, 
may that never be said of us
Don't ever let your worship of God become an avenue to good fortune
We worship God because of His love for us and because of who He is, not because loving Him can help our bottom line
Let's worship God the right way.
During our church's Christmas celebration, I watched the choir members assemble in front of the congregation while the music director rifled through papers on a slim black stand
The instruments began, and the singers launched into a well-known song that started with these words: 'Come, now is the time to worship.'
Although I expected to hear a time-honored Christmas carol, I smiled at the appropriate choice of music
Earlier that week I had been reading Luke's account of Jesus' birth, and I noticed that the first Christmas lacked our modern-day parties, gifts, and feasting, but it did include worship
After the angel announced Jesus' birth to some wide-eyed shepherds, a chorus of angels began 'praising God and saying: '\sGlory to God in the highest!''
The shepherds responded by running to Bethlehem where they found the newborn King lying in a barnyard bassinet
They returned to their fields 'glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen'
Coming face to face with the Son inspired the shepherds to worship the Father
Today, consider your response to Jesus' arrival on earth
Is there room for worship in your heart on this day that celebrates His birth?
Medical researchers are working tirelessly to find a cure for cancer, a clue to the mystery of Alzheimer's, and ways to conquer a host of other debilitating diseases
But what if you awoke to headlines saying DEATH DESTROYED
Would you believe it
Could you believe it
The New Testament proclaims that for the believer in Christ, death has been destroyed, reduced to inactivity, rendered incapable of doing what it once did
'So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: 'Death is swallowed up in victory''
This good news is for everyone who will receive it, just as the angel told the shepherds when Jesus was born, 'Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people
For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord'
The birth of Jesus was the beginning of the end for death
'The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law
But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ'
That is why we celebrate Christmas!
Pastor Tim Keller of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in Manhattan rightly observes that Christianity is unique among all religions for it is about God's pursuit of us to draw us to Himself
In every other religious system, people pursue their god, hoping that through good behavior, keeping of rituals, good works, or other efforts they will be accepted by the god they pursue
The British poet Francis Thompson catches the profound nature of this reality when he writes of the relentless pursuit of God in his life
In his work titled 'The Hound of Heaven,'
he writes that as he fled from God he couldn't outrun 'those strong feet that followed
with unhurrying chase and unperturbed pace.'
But God's untiring pursuit of the wayward is not just Thompson's story
At the heart of the Christmas message is the wonderful truth of God's pursuit of every one of us
As Paul affirms, 'God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law'
And it's not just the Christmas story
It's the story of God's pursuit of Adam and Eve after the fall
His pursuit of me
His pursuit of you
Where would we be today if God weren't the 'Hound of Heaven'??
A British treasure hunter discovered a huge stash of Roman coins buried in a field in southwest England
Using a metal detector, Dave Crisp located a large pot holding 52,000 coins
These ancient silver and bronze coins, which date from the third century AD and weigh more than 350 pounds, are valued at $5 million
While Crisp's treasure may cause us to dream about somehow finding similar riches, we as Christians should be on a different kind of treasure hunt
What we seek does not consist of silver and gold
Rather our quest is to gather the precious gems of insight so that we might gain the 'full assurance of understanding
, both of the Father and of Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge'
The hidden treasure of knowing the Lord more completely is found in the Bible
The psalmist said, 'I rejoice at Your Word as one who finds great treasure'
If we read the Word of God hurriedly or carelessly, we will miss its deep insights
These truths must be sought earnestly with all the attention of someone seeking hidden treasure
Are you eager to find the treasures stored in Scripture
Start digging!
In the early hours of December 21, 2010, I witnessed an event that last occurred in 1638, a total lunar eclipse on the winter solstice
Slowly the shadow of the earth slipped across the bright full moon and made it appear a dark red
It was a remarkable and beautiful event
Yet it reminded me that while physical darkness is part of God's created design, spiritual darkness is not
Scottish pastor Alexander MacLaren said: 'Rejected light is the parent of the densest darkness, and the man who, having the light, does not trust it, piles around himself thick clouds of obscurity and gloom.'
Jesus described this self-imposed spiritual eclipse of heart and mind when He said, 'If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!'
The great invitation of Christmas is to open our hearts to the Savior who came to end our darkness
Jesus said, 'While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light
I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in Me should not abide in darkness'
The way out of our spiritual night is to walk in the light with Him.
As my kids were discarding their trash at the local mall food court, my oldest son was almost run into by a man who was clearly on a mission
My younger son jokingly remarked, 'Maybe he stole something.'
Thinking I might be able to use this as a teachable moment, I said, 'That's what the Bible calls judging.'
He then asked with a smile: 'Why are you always '\spastoring' me?'
After I finished laughing, I told my sons that I could never take a vacation from shepherding them
The apostle Paul told the Ephesian elders that they too could never take a vacation from shepherding God's people
He was convinced that false teachers would try to ravage the church , and the elders needed to protect the group from them
Caring for God's people includes feeding them spiritually, leading them gently, and warning them firmly
Leaders in the church are to be motivated by the incalculable price Christ paid on the cross
Church leaders have a big responsibility to watch over our souls, for one day they will give an account to the Lord for their work among us
Let's bring them joy now by responding to their faithful, godly leadership with obedience and submission .
Recently, my husband and I were reacquainted with a young man we had known as a child many years ago
We fondly reminisced about a Christmas program when Matthew had sung, in a perfect boy soprano, the song 'All Is Well' by Wayne Kirkpatrick and Michael W Smith
It was a wonderful memory of a song beautifully sung
All is well, all is well;  Lift up your voice and sing
Born is now Emmanuel,  Born is our Lord and Savior
Sing Alleluia, sing Alleluia, all is well
To hear the words of that song at Christmastime is comforting to many
But some people are unable to absorb the message because their lives are in turmoil
They've experienced the loss of a loved one, persistent unemployment, a serious illness, or depression that will not go away
Their hearts loudly cry out, 'All is not well' not for me!'
But for those of us who celebrate the birth of our Savior, despite the dark night of the soul we may experience' all is well because of Christ
We are not alone in our pain
God is beside us and promises never to leave
He promises that His grace will be sufficient
He promises to supply all our needs
And He promises us the amazing gift of eternal life
As we review God's promises, we can agree with the poet John Greenleaf Whittier, who wrote, 'Before me, even as behind, God is, and all is well.'?
How far is it from Nazareth to Bethlehem
If you're in Pennsylvania, it's about 9 miles and takes about 10 minutes by car
But if you're in Nazareth of Galilee, and you're traveling along with your pregnant wife, as Joseph was, it's about 80 miles to Bethlehem
That journey probably took Joseph and Mary about a week, and they didn't stay in a nice hotel when they got there
All Joseph could find was a stall in a stable, and that's where Mary delivered 'her firstborn Son'
But the journey for the infant Jesus was much farther than 80 miles
He left His place in heaven at God's right hand, came to earth, and accepted our humanity
Eventually, He was stretched out on a cross to die, and He was buried in a borrowed tomb
But the journey was not over
He conquered death, left the tomb, walked again among men, and ascended to heaven
Even that is not the journey's end
Someday He will return as King of kings and Lord of lords
As you take a Christmas journey this month, reflect on the journey Jesus made for us
He came from heaven to earth to die for us, making salvation available through His death on the cross and His glorious resurrection
Praise God for that first Christmas journey!
As we drove home from a Christmas party one evening, my family and I approached a small country church nestled between glittering snowbanks
From a distance, I could see its holiday display
Strings of white lights formed the capital letters: H-O-P-E
The sight of that word shining in the darkness reminded me that Jesus is, and always has been, the hope of humankind
Before Jesus was born, people hoped for the Messiah	the One who would shoulder their sin and intercede with God on their behalf
They expected the Messiah to arrive through a virgin who would bear a son in Bethlehem and would name Him Immanuel, 'God with us'
The night Jesus was born, their hope was fulfilled
Although we're no longer waiting for Jesus in the form of an infant, He is still the source of our hope
We watch for His second coming ; we anticipate the heavenly home He is preparing for us ; and we dream of living with Him in His celestial city
As Christians, we can look forward to the future because the baby in the manger was, and still is, 'the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope'
Ah, the life of a pig
Each new day brings nothing but slopping through the mud and snorting happily at mealtime
And what meals they have
Crunchy corn husks or whatever leftovers get tossed into the pen
It probably didn't sound good to the prodigal son either
Before he started eating with pigs, he had a warm bed, a rich inheritance, a loving father, a secure future, and probably good food
But it wasn't enough
He wanted 'fun'
He wanted to run his own life and do whatever he desired
It resulted in a pig's dinner
Whenever a young person ignores the guidance of godly parents and the instruction of God's Word, similar results occur
It always shocks me when someone who professes to know Jesus chooses a life that rejects God's clear teaching
Whether the choices include sexual sin, addictive substances, a lack of ambition, or something else, any action that leaves God out risks ending badly
If we ignore clear biblical morals and neglect our relationship with God, we can expect trouble
Luke tells us that the young man turned things around after he came to his senses
Keep your senses about you
Live for God by the guidance of His Word' unless you have a hankering for the husks.
After the American TV personality Ed McMahon died in 2009, one newspaper headline read, 'When it came to being the No 2 man, he was No 1.'
Best known for his 30-year tenure as Johnny Carson's late-night sidekick
McMahon excelled at helping Carson succeed in the spotlight
While most entertainers strive for top billing, McMahon was content with a supporting role
When the apostle Paul gave instructions about how to exercise our gifts as members of the body of Christ , he affirmed the value of supporting roles
He began by saying that we should have a realistic opinion of ourselves , and he concluded with a call to genuine, unselfish love: 'Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honor giving preference to one another'
JB Phillips translates it, 'a willingness to let the other man have the credit.'
Our gifts and abilities come to us by God's grace and are to be used by faith in love and service for Christ, not for personal recognition
May God grant us the ability to embrace with enthusiasm the supporting roles to which He calls us
The ultimate goal is His glory and not our own.
When I was about 5 years old, my father decided that I needed a horse of my own to care for
So he bought an old bay mare and brought her home to me
I named her Dixie
Dixie was a formidable beast for me at my age and small stature
No saddle was small enough, no stirrups short enough for my legs, so I rode bareback most of the time
Dixie was plump, which meant that my feet stuck straight out, making it difficult to stay astride
But whenever I fell off, Dixie would simply stop, look at me, and wait while I tried to climb on her back again
This leads me to Dixie's most admirable trait: She was wonderfully patient
I, on the other hand, was less than patient with Dixie
Yet she bore my childish tantrums with stoic patience, never once retaliating
I wish I could be more like Dixie, having patience that overlooks a multitude of offenses
I have to ask myself, 'How do I react when others aggravate me?'
Do I respond with humility, meekness, and patience
Or with intolerance and indignation
To overlook an offense
To forgive 70 times 7
To bear with human frailty and failure
To show mercy and kindness to those who exasperate us
To gain such control over our souls, this is the work of God.
Money is tight when you're a college student
So when free food is available, students will show up anytime, anywhere
If a company wants to recruit new employees, it will entice young people on college campuses to come to a presentation by offering free pizza
Some students attend presentation after presentation, just for the pizza
The food in the present seems to be more important than the job for the future
Jesus fed a crowd of 5,000, and the next day many searched for Him
He challenged them: 'You seek Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled'
It seems that the food was more important to some of the people than the everlasting life Jesus offered in Himself
He told them He was 'the bread of God who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world'
Some didn't believe, wouldn't accept His teaching, and 'walked with Him no more'
They had wanted the food, but they didn't want Him and what would be required of them to follow Him
Jesus calls us today to come to Him, not for the blessings from His hand but to receive the eternal life He offers and to follow Him, 'the bread of God.'?
On a recent trip, the flight attendant asked if I flew very often
When I said I did, he asked, 'Have you noticed people on planes becoming increasingly more belligerent and aggressive in recent months?'
I had to confess that I agreed with him
We began talking about what might be contributing to it, things like increased airport security, higher costs, fewer services, and a general dissatisfaction with travel
As if to prove the point, our conversation was interrupted by a passenger who refused to sit in his assigned seat because he liked someone else's seat assignment better
When we encounter anger and belligerence, the follower of Christ can be a peacemaker
Paul wrote to the church at Rome with this challenge, 'If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men'
What does that mean
For one thing, it means that we must control what we can control
We can't control the attitudes of others, but we can control our response
When we see angry or hostile attitudes displayed around us, we can show the heart of the Prince of Peace by responding graciously in a peaceful manner
In this way we will demonstrate the attitude of our Savior in a world filled with a growing belligerence.
A popular slogan says, 'Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.'
I see the phrase everywhere, on everything from T-shirts to pieces of art
It's a catchy phrase, but I think it's misleading
If we measure life by breathtaking moments, we miss the wonder of ordinary moments
Eating, sleeping, and breathing seem 'ordinary'
in that we do them every day, usually without much thought
But they are not ordinary at all
Every bite and every breath are miracles
In fact, having breath is more miraculous than anything that takes our breath away
King Solomon may have had more breathtaking moments than anyone
He said, 'I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure'
But he expressed cynicism about it by saying, 'All of it is meaningless'
Solomon's life reminds us that it's important to find joy in 'ordinary' things, for they are indeed wonderful
Bigger is not always better
More is not always an improvement
Busier doesn't make us more important
Rather than look for meaning in breathtaking moments, we should find meaning in every breath we take, and make every breath meaningful.
On some of the Christmas cards you will receive this year, no doubt there will be a man standing in the background looking over the shoulder of Mary, who is prominently displayed caring for the baby Jesus
His name is Joseph
And after the nativity narratives, he isn't heard from much again
If we didn't know better, we would think Joseph was an insignificant bystander or, at best, a mere necessity to undergird Jesus' claim to the throne of David
But, in fact, the role that Joseph played was strategically important
If he had disobeyed the angel's command to take Mary as his wife , he would have, from a human perspective, put the entire mission of Jesus at risk
Taking Mary as his wife was a risky assignment
Public perception that he was the baby's father put him in serious violation of Jewish law and made him a public disgrace
Yet today all of us are thankful that he was willing to risk his reputation to participate in and facilitate God's unfolding drama
Most of us are insignificant compared to the major players in this world
But all of us are called to obey
Who knows what God has in store when we are willing to surrender to God's will, even when it puts us at risk!
I've been told that 'three-wish stories'
occur in almost every culture, all following a similar theme: A benefactor appears and offers to grant three wishes to an unsuspecting beneficiary
The fact that the stories so often occur suggests we all want something we cannot get on our own
There's even a 'wish story' in the Bible
It happened one night when the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream and said to him, 'Ask what shall I give you?'
Solomon could have asked for anything'riches, honor, fame, or power
But he asked for none of these things
He requested 'an understanding heart'
or a 'hearing heart,' a humble heart to listen and learn from God's Word
The young, inexperienced king, weighed down with the responsibilities of ruling a vast nation, needed the Lord's wisdom to govern well
Am I that wise
If God spoke to me directly and asked what He could do for me, what would I ask for
Would I ask for health, wealth, youth, power, or prestige
Or would I ask for wisdom, holiness, and love
Would I be wise or foolish
Suppose God asked you what He could give to you, what would you ask for?
In The Weight of Glory, CS Lewis tells the story of a woman who gave birth to a son while confined as a prisoner in a dungeon
Since the boy had never seen the outside world, his mother tried to describe it by making pencil drawings
Later when he and his mother were released from prison, the simple pencil sketches were replaced by the actual images of our beautiful world
In a similar way, the inspired picture the Bible gives us of heaven will someday be replaced by joyful, direct experience
Paul understood that our perception of heaven is limited until one day in the future when we will be in Christ's presence
'Now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face, now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known'
Yet Paul's confidence in future glory gave him strength in the midst of trial: 'I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us'
Our current idea of the glories of heaven is only a simple sketch
But we can be completely confident in Jesus' claim that He has gone to prepare a place for us
The best is yet to come!
When a US Navy vessel arrives or departs from the military bases in Pearl Harbor, the crew of that ship lines up in dress uniform
They stand at attention at arm's length on the outer edges of the deck, in salute to the soldiers, sailors, and civilians who died on December 7, 1941
It is a stirring sight, and participants often list it among the most memorable moments of their military career
Even for spectators on shore, the salute triggers an incredible emotional connection, but especially between the servants of today and the servants of yesterday
It grants nobility to the work of today's sailor, while giving dignity to the sacrifice of those from the past
When Jesus instituted the Lord's Supper , it was surely with an eye toward creating this same kind of emotional bond
Our participation in the Lord's Table honors His sacrifice while also granting us a connection to Him unlike any other act of remembrance
Just as the Navy carefully prescribes the way it salutes the fallen, so too Scripture teaches us how to remember Jesus' sacrifice
These acts of reverence and thanksgiving serve to honor past action while giving purpose to present service.
Does it bother you to see how much attention is paid in today's culture to people who stand for all the wrong things
Perhaps it is entertainment stars who get the headlines while espousing immoral philosophies in their music, movies, or programs
Or it could be leaders who openly thumb their noses at right-living standards
It would be easy to fret about this and wring our hands in despair, but Psalm 37 suggests a better way
Listen to David's wise advice: 'Do not fret because of evildoers, nor be envious of the workers of iniquity'
While it is right to be 'salt and light'
in this tasteless, dark world, attempting to counter sin by reflecting Jesus' light wherever possible, we cannot let negative forces cause us to live in anger and wrath
Instead, we must rely on God to have the ultimate say about evildoers: 'They shall soon be cut down like the grass'
Beyond that, we should take David's approach: 'Trust in the Lord, and do good.'
'Feed on His faithfulness.'
'Delight yourself also in the Lord.'
'Commit your way to the Lord.'
'Rest in the Lord'
We may not like what we see and hear from some aspects of society, but remember this: God is in control
Trust Him to do what is right
And don't fret.
A friend described his grandmother as one of the greatest influences in his life
Throughout his adult years, he has kept her portrait next to his desk to remind himself of her unconditional love
'I really do believe,'
he said, 'that she helped me learn how to love.'
Not everyone has had a similar taste of human love, but through Christ each of us can experience being well-loved by God
In 1 John 4, the word love occurs 27 times, and God's love through Christ is cited as the source of our love for God and for others
'In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins'
'We have known and believed the love that God has for us'
'We love Him because He first loved us'
God's love is not a slowly dripping faucet or a well we must dig for ourselves
It is a rushing stream that flows from His heart into ours
Whatever our family background or experiences in life, whether we feel well-loved by others or not, we can know love
We can draw from the Lord's inexhaustible source to know His loving care for us, and we can pass it on to others
In Christ our Savior, we are well-loved.
In the days of Adam and Eve, peace was lost
As soon as they ate the forbidden fruit and realized their nakedness, they started blaming each other and introduced conflict to God's peaceful planet
Sadly, all of their descendants, including us, have followed their bad example
We blame others for our own bad choices and become angry when no one will accept the guilt
Blaming others for our unhappiness breaks apart families, churches, communities, and nations
We can't make peace because we're preoccupied with placing the blame
Christmas is the season of peace
The Old Testament tells the story of how God set the stage to introduce the Prince of Peace
Jesus came to break the cycle of sin and blame by making peace for us with God 'through the blood of His cross'
Instead of blaming us for all the trouble we cause, He bore the blame for all of us
He is now recruiting followers who, having received His forgiveness, want others to receive it as well
When we accept forgiveness from God, we lose our desire to withhold it from others
And when we live in peace with God, we are eager to make peace with others
We can both give and receive the gift of peace this Christmas.
When our kids were young, my wife Martie and I enjoyed family vacations in Florida visiting our parents
It was especially wonderful to be there in the warmth for a brief respite from the Michigan wind-chill factor
I couldn't wait to just relax on the beach with a good book
But my kids had other ideas
They wanted my help building sandcastles
Reluctantly, I'd get up to help, only to be quickly consumed by the project at hand
Before I knew it, I had spent hours creating an impressive castle, not thinking that it was only a matter of time until the tide would wash away all my hard work
We often make the same mistake in life, spending lots of time and energy building our own little 'castles'
of stuff and basking in our accomplishments
It all may seem worthwhile, but in the end it's worthless
In Luke 12, Jesus challenged His followers to sell their possessions and give to the poor, 'For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also'
In other words, the way we spend our time and resources says a lot about our eternal perspective
As the old hymn goes, 'Only one life, 'twill soon be past; only what's done for Christ will last.'
So what have you done today that will last for eternity?
College students rent a house from my sister and her husband
One night, a thief attempted to break in
When the young woman living there called the police to tell them that a break-in was in progress, the operator responded in an unusual way: 'You'll have to call back in the morning
We're just too busy right now.'
That response was very disturbing
The young woman had done the right thing by calling the police, but for some reason her plea for help was disregarded
That kind of indifference is upsetting
But indifference never happens when we go to God in prayer
We may not always feel that God is listening, but He is
He cares, and He will respond
The Bible reminds us that we can take comfort in the fact that our God is deeply concerned with what concerns our hearts: 'The Lord is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth'
When we call out to Him, we will never get a disinterested response
Rather than distancing Himself from us when we cry to Him, our heavenly Father draws close to us in our time of need
He is never too busy for His child's prayers, He hears us when we call.
I believe that all Scripture is related and all Scripture is relevant
Nevertheless, I was surprised when my November reading in the book of 1\sPeter touched on all four themes of Advent' 
that period of time on the church calendar when many Christians prepare to celebrate the first coming of Christ while looking forward to His second coming
During Advent, we emphasize hope, peace, joy, and love, which God sent with Christ
HOPE
We have an inheritance reserved in heaven, a living hope through the resurrection of Christ from the dead
PEACE
We will love life and see good days if we turn from evil and do good and if we seek peace, for the Lord watches over the righteous and hears their prayers
JOY
We have inexpressible joy even though we have trials because our faith is being tested and proven genuine
The end of this faith is the salvation of our souls
LOVE
We can love one another with a pure heart because we have been born again through the Word of God which lives and abides forever
Because Christ came the first time, we can live with hope, peace, joy, and love till He comes again.
On November 24, 1971, a man known today as DB Cooper hijacked a commercial flight between Portland and Seattle by threatening to blow up the plane unless he received $200,000
After landing to receive a ransom, he ordered the plane back into the air
Then the rear stairs of the 727 aircraft were lowered, and he parachuted into the night
He was never captured, and the case is still unsolved
This act hastened the age of airport security in which trust and confidence have been replaced by suspicion and fear
What he did affected us all
The Bible describes two actions that changed the world in a far more significant way
Through Adam's choice, sin and death entered the world, 'and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned'
But through Christ's sacrifice on the cross, God provided a remedy for the results of sin
'Through one man's [Adam's] offense judgment came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man's [Christ's] righteous act the free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life'
Christ did what no one else could do when He broke the power of sin and death by His resurrection
He offers forgiveness and eternal life to all who will accept His gift
And for that, we thank Him with all our hearts.
My dad recently turned 90 years old and his physical capabilities are fading
He can still move around with his walker, but he needs someone to cook his meals and help him with other tasks
My older brother Steve and his wife Judy lived close to him, so they decided to move in with Dad to care for him
Wanting to help in some way, my wife and I flew across the country to help out a bit by watching Dad while my brother and his wife had some time away together
We enjoyed our time with my father and were glad to ease Steve and Judy's load, even if it was only for a few days
The Bible says to 'honor your father and mother'
One New Testament commentary says that to honor someone is to 'treat him with the deference, respect, reverence, kindness, courtesy, and obedience which his station in life demands.'
For young children, this means obeying parents
For teenagers, it indicates showing respect for Mom and Dad even if you think you know more than they do
For young adults, this means including your parents in your life
And for those in middle-age and beyond, it means making sure that parents are cared for as they move into old age or their health declines
How can you honor your parents this week?
On a trip out of the country, I happened to meet an attorney who was from my hometown in New Jersey
We were surprised at how much we had in common
In the course of the conversation, he asked, 'Did you say your name was Stillwell?'
I said, 'No, it's Stowell.'
He then mentioned that he had a client named Stillwell
'Is it Art Stillwell?'
I asked, and, to my surprise, he said yes
Art Stillwell attended my church and was an influential businessman in the community
The attorney admitted that he had no client quite like Art
He explained that most of his clients want him to do whatever it takes to get them out of their problems, but Art was different
Whenever he asked Art what to do in any given situation, Art always replied, 'Just do what's right!'
Obviously it had made an impression on the attorney
Yielding to Christ in all of our desires and decisions regardless of the outcome is what sets us apart in a world full of people consumed by their own interests
When we live blameless lives 'without fault'?, courageously reflecting the integrity, love, and grace of Jesus, we clearly 'shine as lights in the world'
So, if you want to light up your world in a compelling way, just do what's right!
In one way or another, we can all relate to Psalm 86:1 where David says, 'I am poor and needy.'
Even the richest among us should understand that poverty and need relate more to the spirit than to the wallet
When billionaire Rich DeVos speaks to groups he often says, 'I'm just a sinner saved by grace.'
Psalm 86 tells us that the help God provides is not measured by a monetary ledger sheet
When we acknowledge that we are poor and needy, it's not so God will lavish material riches on us
No, we do so to open the door to other, more valuable treasures
Here's what God does for the poor and needy
He will preserve our lives and save all those who trust in Him
He will be merciful and ready to forgive
He will listen to and answer prayer
But we're not to take God's blessings without giving back
We have a responsibility to learn God's ways, walk in His truth, 'fear [God's] name,'
praise the Lord, and 'glorify [His] name'
Do you consider yourself among the 'poor and needy'?
If so, welcome to the club
Let's not forget all the spiritual blessings God has for us and the godly response we should have toward His generosity.
Artist and scientist Michael Flynn designed a singing bowl for display in ArtPrize, an international art competition held in Grand Rapids, Michigan
The bowl requires no electricity but it does require something that is in short supply: cooperation
As I observed people trying to make the bowl sing, I was surprised that none of them bothered to read the directions about rocking it gently
Instead, impatient to make music, they kept trying their own ideas
After a few minutes they walked away frustrated and disappointed, as if the bowl was defective
How many times, I wonder, do we become frustrated that life isn't working the way we think it should
We keep trying ways that seem right, but things keep turning out wrong
Instead of following God's Word, we continue trying to find our own way
The singing bowl reminds us that we can't expect life to go well if we ignore the instructions of the Designer
Failing to obey divides us from one another and separates us from God
To fulfill His plan for the world and make the way of salvation known , we need to follow His instructions about living and working peacefully together
When life doesn't go well, it may be that we've stopped following God's plan.
A study conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota found that almost 15 percent of American teenagers felt it was 'highly likely'
that they would die before their 35th birthday
Those with this pessimistic outlook were more likely to engage in reckless behavior
Dr Iris Borowsky, author of the study published in Pediatrics magazine, said: 'These youth may take risks because they feel hopeless and figure that not much is at stake.'
No one is immune to feelings of despair
The Psalms express repeated pleas for help when life seems dark
'Why are you in despair, O my soul and why have you become disturbed within me
Hope in God, for I shall again praise Him for the help of His presence'
In a defiant step of faith, the psalmist tells himself not to forget about God, who will never forsake him
Curtis Almquist has written: 'Hope is fueled by the presence of God
[It] is also fueled by the future of God in our lives.'
We can say with the psalmist, 'I shall yet praise Him'
No follower of Christ should feel reluctant to seek counsel for depression
Nor should we feel that faith and prayer are too simplistic to help
There is always hope in God
Each year at the end of November, the President of the United States issues an official pardon for the National Thanksgiving Turkey
During this lighthearted ceremony, one president remarked: 'Our guest of honor looks a little nervous
Nobody's told him yet that I'm going to give him a pardon.'
The poor turkey had a good reason to be uneasy, without an acquittal, he was doomed to be Thanksgiving dinner
We are in a similar situation when it comes to our sin
Without God's pardon, we're on our way to certain demise
This condition is a direct result of our own wrongdoing
The Bible says, 'The wages of sin is death'
However, we can be set free from this death sentence because God's Son bore our sin in His body on the cross, 'that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness
by whose stripes you were healed.'
First John 1:7 tells us that Jesus' blood 'cleanses us from all sin.'
We can accept God's pardon for our sin and receive eternal life when we confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and believe that God raised Him from the dead
Today, consider how you will respond to God's offer of forgiveness.
My cable company sent a postcard inviting me to check out its latest improvements in TV channels
The card indicated that I needed to contact the company to get the necessary new digital equipment and explained how to hook it up and activate it
After that, the ad said I was just to 'sit back and enjoy the World of More.'
The card made me think of the 'World of More'
that Christians are privileged to live in
When God transports people from the darkness of sin 'into His marvelous light'
a whole new life opens up
Romans 5 tells us some of the more that we have in Christ: We have been 'reconciled to God through the death of His Son'
and therefore have 'peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ'
We have access to God and His grace
Rejoicing in trouble is now possible because we understand that it's an opportunity to grow in our character through trusting Him
Additionally, the Holy Spirit, who has been given to live in us, pours the love of God into our hearts
And sin no longer has the same hold on us
As Christians, we have unlimited access to a real 'World of More.'
Wouldn't it be selfish not to invite others to join us in that special world?
The whole reason for saying thanks is to let the giver of a gift know how much you appreciate something
Author GB Stern once said, 'Silent gratitude isn't much use to anyone.'
When our son was young, he sometimes needed to be reminded that avoiding eye contact, looking down at his feet, and mumbling some unintelligible words was not an acceptable 'thank you.'
And after many years of marriage, my husband and I are still learning that it's important for us to continually express our gratitude to each other
When one of us feels appreciative, we try to verbalize it, even if we've said it many times before about the same thing
William Arthur Ward said, 'Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it.'
Showing our gratitude is obviously important in human relationships, but it's even more essential in our relationship with God
As we think about the many blessings we have received, do we express our thanks to Him throughout the day
And when we think of the amazing gift of His death and resurrection for forgiveness of our sins, do our hearts bubble over with awe and thanksgiving
Take the reminder in Psalm 107:1 to heart each day: 'Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good!'?
I recently saw a documentary about the making of a Steinway piano
It traced the meticulous care that goes into crafting this fine instrument
From the cutting of trees until the piano appears on a showroom floor, it goes through countless delicate adjustments by skilled craftsmen
When the year-long process is complete, accomplished musicians play the piano and often comment on how the same rich sounds could never be produced by a computerized assembly line
The secret to the final product is the craftsman's touch
When the tabernacle was built, we see that God also valued the craftsman's touch
He chose the craftsman Bezalel and said of him: 'I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, to design artistic works, to work in gold, in silver, in bronze, in cutting jewels for setting, in carving wood'
Today God dwells in the hearts of believers
Yet the call to craftsmanship has not ended
Now each individual believer is God's 'workmanship'
The Master Craftsman is the Holy Spirit, who chips away at flaws in our character to make each of us like Jesus
And as we yield to His workmanship, we will find that the secret to the final product is the Craftsman's touch.
There's an old Sunday school song that periodically comes back to my mind
Its words testify to the blessing of the peace that Jesus so generously gives: 'I have the peace that passes understanding down in my heart, down in my heart to stay!'
There is something missing in that well-intentioned song, however
The peace of God is truly a gift we enjoy in our hearts as we fellowship in His presence
But He never intended for us to keep all of that peace to ourselves
Peace is a gift to be shared with those around us
As Christians, it should mark our relationships and characterize the environment of our churches
In His Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said, 'Blessed are the peacemakers'
which indicates that we are to be intentional about bringing peace to our relationships
Since we are prone to be troublemakers instead of peacemakers, this is important advice
So, what does peacemaking look like
Peacemakers are those who turn the other cheek , go the extra mile , and love their enemies while praying for those who persecute them
Why should we do this
Because God is a peacemaker, and when we make peace we are 'called sons of God'
Peacemaking is a family trait.
God did some fall housecleaning this week
He sent a mighty wind through our neighborhood that made the trees tremble and shake loose their dead branches
When it finished, I had a mess to clean up
In my own life, God sometimes works in a similar way
He will send or allow stormy circumstances that shake loose the 'lifeless branches'
I've been refusing to release
Sometimes it's something that once was good, like an area of ministry, but is no longer bearing fruit
More often it's something that's not good, like a bad habit I've slid into or a stubborn attitude that prevents new growth
The Old Testament prophet Jonah discovered what can happen when one refuses to get rid of a stubborn attitude
His hatred for the Ninevites was stronger than his love for God, so God sent a great storm that landed Jonah in a giant fish
God preserved the reluctant prophet in that unlikely place and gave him a second chance to obey
The lifeless limbs in my yard caused me to think of attitudes that God expects me to dispose of
Paul's letter to the Ephesians lists some of them: bitterness, anger, and evil speech
When God shakes things up, we need to get rid of what He shakes loose.
Is it possible, in a society that seems increasingly indifferent to the gospel, to communicate the Good News to people who don't share our faith
One way to connect with people who are unfamiliar with the things of Christ is to become culturally 'bilingual.'
We do this by communicating in ways people can easily relate to
Knowing about and discussing music, film, sports, and television, for example, can offer just such an opportunity
If people hear us 'speak their language,' without endorsing or condoning the media or events we refer to, it could open the door to sharing the timeless message of Christ
Paul gave us an example of this in Acts 17
While visiting the Areopagus in Athens, he spoke to a thoroughly secular culture by quoting pagan Greek poets as a point of reference for the spiritual values he sought to communicate
He said, 'In Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, '\sFor we are also His offspring''
Just as Paul addressed that culture by knowing what they were reading, we may have greater impact for the gospel by relating it to people in terms they can readily embrace
Are you trying to reach a neighbor or a co-worker with the gospel
Try becoming bilingual.
I love to walk Idaho's paths and trails and enjoy its grandeur and picturesque beauty
I'm often reminded that these treks are symbolic of our spiritual journey, for the Christian life is simply walking, with Jesus alongside as our companion and guide
He walked through the land of Israel from one end to the other, gathering disciples, saying to them, 'Follow Me'
The journey is not always easy
Sometimes giving up seems easier than going on, but when things get difficult, we can rest a while and renew our strength
In Pilgrim's Progress, John Bunyan describes the arbor on Hill Difficulty where Christian caught his breath before continuing the climb
His scroll provided comfort, reminding him of the Lord's continual presence and sustaining power
He got a second wind so he could walk a few more miles
Only God knows where the path will take us, but we have our Lord's assurance, 'I am with you always'
This is not a metaphor or other figure of speech
He is real company
There is not one hour without His presence, not one mile without His companionship
Knowing He's with us makes the journey lighter.
When Secret Service agents train bank tellers to identify counterfeit bills, they show them both fake money and real money, and they study both
To detect a counterfeit problem, they must look for the differences in the genuine bill compared to the counterfeit, and not the similarities
In 1 John 2, the apostle John helps to protect believers from heresy by showing them examples of counterfeit Christians and teachers
One of the signs of the last days is the coming of antichrists
Antichrists are those who claim to have His power and authority but don't, or those who reject and oppose Him and His teachings
John gave three marks of false teachers who are controlled by the spirit of the antichrists: They depart from the fellowship , they deny Jesus as the Messiah , and they draw the faithful away from Jesus
He encouraged believers to protect themselves against the spirit of the antichrists by depending on the indwelling presence of the Spirit, knowing the truth, and remaining in fellowship with Jesus
We can protect ourselves from error and deception by knowing the false but relying on the Truth, Jesus Christ.
Have you ever tasted baby food
I have
It's terribly bland
But babies have no other choice without teeth
They certainly can't eat a nice, juicy steak
Sadly, some Christians are content with spiritual baby food
They are happy to go over and over the simple truths of the Scriptures and don't move beyond the basics of the gospel
By not sinking their teeth into deeper truths and more difficult Bible passages, they lack biblical understanding and convictions to make right choices
They may have been Christians for many years, but their spiritual abilities remain underdeveloped
They remain babies
As children grow physically, they learn to eat solid food that gives them strength and vitality
In the same way, every believer needs to take on the responsibility to feed himself on solid spiritual food
To fail to do this is to remain spiritually weak and undernourished
You can roughly tell the physical age of people by how they look
Their spiritual age is revealed by their ability to distinguish good from evil and by their personal character that's shown day by day
Is this spiritual discernment evident in your life
Or are you still on spiritual baby food?
Jerusalem was engulfed in flames, and the prophet Jeremiah wept
His prediction of divine judgment had largely gone unheeded
Now his terrible prophecy had come to pass with horrifying vividness
The short book of Lamentations records the prophet's grieving process over the destruction of Jerusalem
Jeremiah organized the book around the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, using a technique of alphabetic acrostics to aid the reader in memorizing the passages more easily
But using this technique also shows that he didn't cut short his grieving process
He took deliberate and intentional time to reflect upon and even to write down his heartbreak
In the midst of his grief, the comfort of God surfaced
Reminders of God's sovereignty and goodness gave the prophet hope as he faced the future 'The Lord will not cast off forever
Though He causes grief, yet He will show compassion according to the multitude of His mercies'
If you've recently experienced a painful loss, remember to take adequate time to grieve and to reflect upon God's goodness
Then you will be able to experience His comfort and hope for the future.
While awaiting a routine medical procedure in a local hospital, I noticed a wall plaque showing Christ on a cross
Later, a nurse asked me several administrative questions, in-cluding, 'Do you have any spiritual needs you'd like to discuss with a chaplain?'
I said that I appreciated her asking that question, which I found unusual in today's world
She replied with a smile that they are a faith-based hospital and 'that's part of our mission.'
I was impressed that the people were not afraid to be who they are in an increasingly secular and pluralistic society
Peter urged the first-century believers who had been scattered by persecution and were living in a hostile world to consider it a blessing to suffer for the sake of what is right
'But even if you suffer for doing what is right, God will reward you for it
So don't worry or be afraid of their threats
Instead, you must worship Christ as Lord of your life
And if someone asks about your Christian hope, always be ready to explain it'
Just as the woman at the hospital freely stated their faith, so we can express ours
And if we are criticized or treated unfairly because of our belief in Christ, we should respond with gentleness and respect
We should never be afraid to be who we are in Him.
Robyn and Steve have a counseling ministry that provides very little income
Recently, a family crisis forced them to embark on a 5,000-mile round trip in their well-used minivan
After attending to the crisis, they started back to Michigan
While about 2,000 miles from home, their van began to sputter and stall
A mechanic looked at it and told them, 'It's done
You need a new engine.'
Unable to afford one, they had no choice but to coax the van home
Three days, a case of oil, and a lot of prayers later, they miraculously limped into their driveway
Then they heard of a 'car missionary'
who assisted people in ministry
Amazed that the van had made it, he offered to replace the engine free of charge
If Steve had gotten the van fixed en route, it would have cost him thousands of dollars he didn't have
In Exodus 15, the Israelites were led by God into the desert
Three days into their trip, they ran out of water and had no way to get it
But God knew about the problem
In fact, a solution awaited them in Marah and Elim
God not only fixed their water problem but also provided a place to rest
Even when our situation looks difficult, we can trust that God is leading
He already knows what we'll need when we get there.
During the Cold War' a period of unrest between major world powers in the last half of the 20th century' Americans lived under the threat of nuclear war
I recall that during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, we seemed to be a heartbeat away from annihilation
It was heady stuff for a sixth-grader
One of my strangest memories of those turbulent times was the school safety drill
An alarm would sound, and we would hide under our desks, for protection from atomic bombs
Looking back, I'm certain it wouldn't have helped us in the event of a nuclear holocaust, it may have even given us a false sense of security
While we may not face the same level of nuclear threat today, there are still many dangers that scare us, and some of them are spiritual
Ephesians 6:12 reminds us that our battles are 'against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.'
These are mighty foes indeed, but God has given us His protective love and the spiritual resources of His armor
The result
While we face powerful enemies, 'we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us'
In our heavenly Father, we have true security.
When Sheri got engaged, her single friend Amy celebrated with her
She planned a bridal shower, helped pick out her wedding dress, walked down the aisle just before her, and stood by her side during the ceremony
When Sheri and her husband had children, Amy gave baby showers and rejoiced in her friend's blessings
Sheri told Amy later, 'You've comforted me during hard times, but the way I especially know you love me is that you rejoice with me in my good times
You haven't let any jealousy hold you back from celebrating with me.'
When John's disciples heard that a new rabbi named Jesus was gaining followers, they thought John might be jealous
They came to him and said, 'He is baptizing, and all are coming to Him!'
But John celebrated Jesus' ministry, 'I have been sent before Him
The friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice
Therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled'
An attitude of humility should also characterize us
Rather than desiring attention for ourselves, everything we do should bring glory to our Savior
'He must increase, but I must decrease'
Autumn is hunting season here in Michigan
For a few weeks every year, licensed hunters are allowed to go out into the woods and hunt for various species of wildlife
Some hunters build elaborate tree stands high above the ground where they sit quietly for hours waiting for a deer to wander within rifle range
When I think of hunters who are so patient when it comes to waiting for deer, I think of how impatient we can be when we have to wait for God
We often equate 'wait' with 'waste'
If we're waiting for something , we think we are doing nothing, which, in an accomplishment-crazed culture, seems like a waste of time
But waiting serves many purposes
In particular, it proves our faith
Those whose faith is weak are often the first to give up waiting, while those with the strongest faith are willing to wait indefinitely
When we read the Christmas story in Luke 2, we learn of two people who proved their faith by their willingness to wait
Simeon and Anna waited long, but their time wasn't wasted; it put them in a place where they could witness the coming of Messiah
Not receiving an immediate answer to prayer is no reason to give up faith.
Where you live has a way of making certain demands on how you live
In my neighborhood, the garbage collector comes on Tuesday mornings. 
So it's my responsibility to get our garbage can out to the curb the night before
Letting the trash pile up on the curb for days before doesn't make for happy neighbors
And we have lots of children playing outside.
So signs are posted everywhere reminding drivers to slow down
That means I drive slowly and watch for little ones who, without looking, chase wayward balls into the street
It's important to remember that God has placed us into the 'kingdom of the Son'
Living in His neighborhood means there are life-transforming behavior patterns that should clearly reflect our spiritual location
This is why Paul reminds us that God's kingdom is not about arguing and bickering over earthly stuff but about 'righteousness and peace and joy'
Living by God's right standards, living to be a peacemaker, and living to be a source of joy in our relationships are what kingdom life is all about
And, when we live like this, our lives please God and bless others
Sounds like the kind of neighborhood anyone would love to live in!
It's my first day on the tractor
A crisp morning breeze brushes across the field
Crickets and country silence yield to the roar of the engine
Dropping the plow into the soil, I head out across the field
I look down at the gauges and gearshift, squeeze the cold steel of the steering wheel, and admire the power at my disposal
Finally, I look back to view the results
Instead of the ramrod straight line I was expecting, I see what looks like a slithering snake
with more bends and curves than the Indianapolis Motor Speedway
We know better 'Plow with your eye on the fence post,'
By staying focused on a point across the field, a person plowing is assured of a straight line
On the return I comply, with telling results: The line is straight
The row was messed up only when I didn't have a focus point
Paul had similar wisdom when he wrote of having his focus on Jesus Christ and the impact it had on him
Not only did he ignore distractions , he set the focus , noted the result , and observed the pattern it sets for others
Like Paul, if we focus on Christ, we will plow a straight path and accomplish God's purpose in our lives.
While in Brazil, I went to see Iguazu Falls, one of the greatest waterfalls in the world
The massive falls are breathtaking
But what impressed me most at Iguazu was not the sight of the falls or the spray of the water, it was the sound
The sound was beyond deafening, I felt as if I was actually inside the sound itself
It was an overwhelming experience that reminded me how small I am by comparison
Later, with this scene in mind, I couldn't help but think about John in Revelation 1:15
While on the island of Patmos, he saw a vision of the risen Christ
The apostle described Jesus in the glory of His resurrection, noting both His clothing and His physical qualities
Then John described Christ's voice 'as the sound of many waters'
I'm not sure I fully appreciated what that meant until I visited Iguazu and was overwhelmed by the thundering sound of the falls
As those mighty waters reminded me of my own smallness, I better understood why John fell at the feet of Christ as if dead
Perhaps that description will help you grasp the awesomeness of Jesus' presence and prompt you to follow John's example of worshiping the Savior.
Ted, one of the elders in our church, used to be a police officer
One day after responding to a report of violence, he said the situation turned life-threatening
A man had stabbed someone and then menacingly turned the blade toward Ted
A fellow officer had taken position and fired his weapon at the assailant as he attacked Ted
The criminal was subdued, but Ted was shot in the crossfire
As he was driven by ambulance to the hospital, he felt deep waves of peace flowing over his soul from the Holy Spirit
Ted felt so tranquil that he was able to offer words of comfort to the law enforcement officer who was emotionally distraught over the crisis
The Lord Jesus promised us peace in crisis
Just hours before His own crucifixion, Christ comforted His disciples with these words: 'Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you
Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid'
What is your worst fear
If you should have to face it, Christ will be there with you
Trusting Him through prayer makes available 'the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding,'
and it 'will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus'
Author CS Lewis says that religious concepts are like soups, some are thick and some are clear
concepts in the Bible: mysteries, subtleties, and complexities that challenge the most accomplished mind
For example, '[God] has mercy on whom He wills, and whom He wills He hardens'
And yet, in the same volume there are thoughts that are crystal 'clear' simple, attainable, and easily grasped
What could ever surpass the simplicity of the clear affirmation in 1 John 4:16, 'God is love'?
John Cameron, a 15th-century writer, suggests, 'In the same meadow, the ox may lick up grass,
the bird may pick up seeds,
and a man finds a pearl; so in one and the same Scripture are varieties to be found for all sorts of conditions
In them, the lamb may wade, and the elephant swim, children may be fed with milk, and meat may be had for stronger men.'
All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are found in God's Book, the Bible, ocean depths that can stir the most sophisticated mind, and shallow areas that can be negotiated by any simple, honest soul
Why hesitate
'All Scripture is profitable'
The United States has spent millions of dollars looking for water on Mars
A few years ago, NASA sent twin robots, Opportunity and Spirit, to the red planet to see if water was present or had been present at one time
Why did the US do this
The scientists who are poring over data sent back from those two little Martian rovers are trying to figure out if life ever existed on Mars
And for that to have happened, there had to be water
No water, no life
Two thousand years ago, a couple of 'rovers'
set out across the countryside of an Earth-outpost called Samaria looking for water
One was a woman who lived nearby
The other was a man from Galilee
They ended up meeting at a well near the village of Sychar
When they did, Jesus found the water He was looking for, and the woman found the water she didn't know she needed
Water is essential for both physical and spiritual life
Jesus had a surprise for the woman at the well
He offered her the Water of Life, Himself
He is the refreshing, renewing 'fountain of water springing up into everlasting life'
Do you know anyone looking for water
Someone who is spiritually thirsty
Introduce that person to Jesus, the Living Water
It's the greatest discovery of all time.
I was walking in a subway in Minsk, Belarus, with my friend Yuliya and her daughter Anastasia when I suddenly fell face first onto the dirty concrete floor
I don't remember the fall, but I do remember suddenly having a mouth filled with sand, gravel, and grit
I couldn't get that stuff out of my mouth quickly enough
I didn't enjoy what went into my mouth on that embarrassing occasion
But Scripture teaches that it's more important to guard what comes out of our mouths
When the writer of Proverbs 15 said that 'the mouth of fools pours forth foolishness'
, the word translated pours forth literally means 'explodes out.'
Rash accusations, angry words, and verbal abuse can do immeasurable and lifelong harm
The apostle Paul spoke bluntly about this: 'Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth'
no dirty talk
He also said to '[put] away lying'
and to 'speak truth'
no lies
And later, 'Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil speaking be put away from you'
no character assassination
What comes out of our mouths should be wholesome and uplifting
We guard carefully what goes into our mouths, and rightly so
To honor God, let's also keep tight control on the words that come out of our mouths.
During a business trip to Philadelphia, I walked down Broad Street toward City Hall each morning to catch the subway
Each day I passed a long line of people waiting for something
They were a cross-section of humanity in age, ethnic origin, and appearance
After wondering about it for 3 days, I asked a man on the sidewalk why all those people were standing in line
He told me that they were on probation or parole after breaking the law and had to take a daily drug test to show that they were staying clean
This struck me as a vivid illustration of my need to stay spiritually clean before God
When the psalmist pondered how he could live a pure life, he concluded that the key was to consider and obey God's teaching
'Your Word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You
Blessed are You, O Lord; Teach me Your statutes
I will delight myself in Your statutes; I will not forget Your Word'
In the light of God's Word, we see our sin, but we also see God's love in Christ
'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
By His grace staying clean.
A writer for The Washington Post conducted an experiment to test people's perception
He asked a famous violinist to perform incognito at a train station in the nation's capital one January morning
Thousands of people walked by as he played, but only a few stopped to listen
After 45 minutes, just $32 had been dropped into the virtuoso's open violin case
Two days earlier, this man, Joshua Bell, had used the same $3.5 million Stradivarius for a sold-out concert where people paid $100 a seat to hear him perform
The idea of a person not being recognized for his greatness isn't new
It happened to Jesus
'He was in the world,'
John said, '
and the world did not know Him'
Why did people who had been expecting the Messiah give Jesus such a cold reception
One reason is that they were surprised
Just as people today don't expect famous musicians to play in railway stations, the people in Jesus' day didn't expect Messiah to be born in a stable
They also expected Him to be a political king, not the head of a spiritual kingdom
The people in the first century were blinded to God's purpose in sending Jesus to this world
He came to save people from their sins
Receive God's surprising gift of salvation that He offers freely to you today.
Satan's sway over mankind began when he turned the minds of Adam and Eve against God
In order to pull it off, he had to lie to them about God, and they had to fall for it
In that defining moment, he lied to them about God's goodness, God's Word, and God's intentions
Satan is still up to his old tricks
Jesus said that when the devil 'speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar'
It should not be surprising, then, that when trouble interrupts our lives, the father of lies whispers in our ears and suddenly we are questioning God's goodness
When we are told to follow His commands, we wonder if His Word is really true in the first place
When Jesus tells us things like, 'Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth'
Satan tells us that the good life is about piling up things here, causing us to doubt God's good intentions
Our problem is that we, like Adam and Eve, believe Satan's lies
And when we do, our loyalty to God is compromised
Then our enemy slithers off to his next assignment, leaving us alone to face our regrets and the realization that his lies have seduced us away from our truest and dearest Friend
Who have you been listening to lately?
Although my culinary skills remain undeveloped, occasionally I use a box of premixed ingredients to make a cake
After adding eggs, vegetable oil, and water, I stir it all together
To bake a palate-pleasing cake, it's vital to have the correct balance of the right ingredients
That helps me picture the relationship of the greatest commandment and the Great Commission as we spread the gospel
When Jesus told His followers to go and make disciples of all nations, He did not give them permission to be rude and uncaring as they did so
His own citing of the 'first and great commandment'?, to love God with all your heart, soul, and mind, was quickly followed by the call to 'love your neighbor as yourself'
Throughout the New Testament, we find this model of compassionate, respectful living restated many places, including 'the love chapter'
and Peter's instruction to give a reason for the hope within us 'with gentleness and respect'
In our eagerness to share Christ with others, we must always include a healthy balance of those two ingredients, the true gospel and godly love
This wonderfully sweet cake bakes best in the warmth of God's love.
Recently I read Psalm 131, one of my favorite psalms
In the past, I viewed it as an encouragement to understand that mystery is one of the hallmarks of God's character
It challenged me to let my mind be at rest, since I am unable to understand all that God is doing in His universe
But then I saw another side of David's calm spirit: I am unable to understand all that God is doing in me, and it is impossible to try
David draws a comparison between a weaned child that no longer frets for what it once demanded, and a soul that has learned the same lesson
It is a call to learn humility, patient endurance, and contentment in all my circumstances, whatever they are, though I do not understand God's reasons
Divine logic is beyond the grasp of my mind
I ask, 'Why this affliction
Why this anguish?'
The Father answers, 'Hush, child
You wouldn't understand if I explained it to you
Just trust Me!'
So, I turn from contemplating David's example to ask myself: Can I, in my circumstances, 'hope in the Lord'?
Can I wait in faith and patience without fretting and without questioning God's wisdom
Can I trust Him while He works in me His good, acceptable, and perfect will?
When Shayla McKnight applied for a job for an online printing company, she was surprised to learn that they had a zero-tolerance policy for gossip
The employees are encouraged to confront one another, instead of gossip about their fellow employees
If employees are caught gossiping, they are reprimanded, and if they continue, they are fired
Long before this kind of policy was ever implemented by a company, God spoke of His own zero-tolerance policy for gossip and slander among His people
Idle talk that foolishly or maliciously spreads rumors or facts about another person was forbidden
Solomon said that speaking badly of others could have disastrous effects
It betrays confidence , separates close friends , shames and saddles you with a bad reputation , and perpetually fuels the embers of a quarrel
People rarely can undo the damage their untrue words have done to a neighbor
Let's ask the Lord to help us not to engage in harmful talk about others
He wants us to set a guard over our mouths so that we'll instead speak all the good we know about everybody.
Have you ever been stuck in an airport
For 24 hours
In a city where you can't speak the language
Four thousand miles from home
It happened to a friend recently, and we can learn from his response
While most of us would find such an inconvenience intolerable, my friend John saw God's hand in his delay
As he waited out his forced stay, he looked for opportunities to connect with fellow passengers
He 'happened'
to find some fellow Christians from India, and in talking to them he heard about a ministry they were involved with
In fact, because John's interests matched his new friends' ministry, they invited him to India to participate in a short-term project
How often do we experience delays, changes of plans, and redirections and treat them as intrusions
It could be that God is detouring us so we can do something different or new for Him
Consider Paul's trip to Philippi in Acts 16
He had gone to Macedonia because of a God-directed vision
How could he know that he would end up in prison there
But even that trip to jail was God-led, because He used Paul to bring salvation to a jailer and his family
God can use inconveniences in our lives if we look at them as divine appointments.
For nearly a year, a former publishing colleague lived under a cloud of fear that he would be fired
A new boss in the department, for reasons unknown, began filling his personnel file with negative comments
Then, on the day my friend expected to lose his job, the new boss was fired instead
When the Israelites were taken as captives to Babylon, a Jew named Mordecai found himself in this kind of situation
Haman, the highest noble of King Xerxes, expected every royal official to kneel down and honor him, but Mordecai refused to bow to anyone but God
This outraged Haman and he set out to destroy not only Mordecai but every Jew in the whole Persian empire
Haman convinced Xerxes to sign a decree authorizing the destruction of all Jews and started building a gallows for the execution of Mordecai
But, in a startling turn of events, Haman was executed on the gallows he had built for Mordecai, and the Jewish people were spared
In literature, this is called poetic justice
Not everyone gets justice in such dramatic fashion, but Scripture promises that God will one day avenge all injustice
While we wait, we are to do what we can to work for justice and leave the results in God's hands.
Jeremiah has been called 'the weeping prophet.'
He may have had a sensitive and melancholic disposition that was compounded by his heartbreak over God's judgment on disobedient Israel
His capacity for sorrow is amazing: 'Oh, that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night!'
As if sorrow for his nation were not enough, Jeremiah was persecuted for his prophetic message of judgment
In one instance, Jeremiah was imprisoned in a cistern filled with mire
Opposition to his ministry had gotten the great prophet stuck in a place of despair
Sometimes in our attempts to serve the Lord, we can feel stuck in painful circumstances and surprising heartache
But the prophet's resilience should inspire us to persevere
Jeremiah's sense of divine call was so strong that he could not be deterred from serving the Lord
'But His word was in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones; I was weary of holding it back, and I could not'
Have the results of your service for the Lord been disappointing
Ask Him to renew your heart by His Spirit, and continue to serve God despite your setbacks.
During the quiet moments before a Sunday morning service, the organist played a hymn that was new to me
I turned to the page noted in the hymnal and read the words of the song 'The Lord My Shepherd Guards Me Well,'
a beautiful paraphrase of Psalm 23: The Lord my Shepherd guards me well, And all my wants are fed: Amid green pastures made to lie, Beside still waters led
My care-worn soul grows strong and whole When God's true path I tread
No matter how often we read or hear the familiar 23rd Psalm, it seems to come with a fresh message of God's care for us
Though I should walk in darkest ways Through valleys like the grave, No evil shall I ever fear; Your presence makes me brave
On my behalf Your rod and staff Assure me You will save
This image was familiar to the people who heard Jesus say, 'I am the good shepherd
The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep'
Unlike a hired person who runs away from danger, the true shepherd stays with the sheep to protect them
'But a hireling, he who is not the shepherd sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees
I am the good shepherd; and I know My sheep'
No matter what you're facing today, Jesus knows your name, He knows the danger, and He will not leave your side
You can say with confidence: The Lord my Shepherd guards me well!
My grandfather refused to say 'goodbye'?; he felt the word was too final
So, when we would drive away after family visits, his farewell ritual was always the same
Standing in front of the green ferns that lined his house, he would wave and call out, 'So long'?
As believers, we never have to say 'goodbye'
to the ones we love, as long as they have placed their trust in Jesus as Savior
The Bible promises that we will see them again
The apostle Paul said that we should not 'sorrow as others who have no hope'
because when Jesus returns, the Christians who have died will rise from their graves and, together with the believers who are still alive, will meet the Lord in the air
We have confidence that one day in heaven there will be 'no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying'
It's in that wonderful place that 'we shall always be with the Lord'
Christians have the hope of an eternal reunion with Christ and with believing loved ones who have passed away
That's why Paul exhorted us to 'comfort one another with these words'
Today, encourage someone with the hope that allows us to say 'so long,'
instead of 'goodbye.'?
Quaker John Woolman was an itinerant preacher who waged his own personal campaign to end slavery in colonial America
Woolman met with slave-holders to speak of the injustice of holding other human beings as property
Although Woolman did not eradicate slavery completely, he did persuade many masters to free their slaves
His success was due to individual, personal persuasion
The book of Philemon contains a similar one-on-one appeal
Onesimus was a runaway slave who had escaped from his Christian master Philemon
Onesimus had come to faith through Paul's ministry, and now Paul was sending him back to Philemon with these words: 'Perhaps he departed for a while for this purpose, that you might receive him forever, no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a beloved brother'
Although we don't know if Onesimus was set free from slavery, his new faith in Jesus had changed his relationship with his Christian master
He was now also a brother in Christ
Paul was influencing his world one heart at a time
By the transforming power of the gospel, people and situations can change
Like Woolman and like Paul, let's seek to influence our world one heart at a time.
Tough times can cause us to get our perspective turned around
I was reminded of this recently as I talked to a fellow-griever, another parent who, like Sue and me, lost a teenage daughter to death suddenly and without warning
She told me she had been missing her daughter terribly, and she told God she felt as if she were hanging on by her fingernails
Then she felt as if God reminded her that His hand of protection was there to hold her up, that she could let go, and He would catch her
That's a better perspective, isn't it
This picture reminds us that when troubles come and we feel least able to hold on to our faith, it's not up to us It's up to God to support us with His mighty hand
Psalm 37:23-24 says: 'The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord; Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; for the Lord upholds him with His hand.'
And Psalm 63:8 tells us: 'My soul follows close behind You; Your right hand upholds me.'
In tough times, we can become so preoccupied with our role in 'clinging to God'
that we forget about His promised protection
It's not our fingernails that sustain us, it's His loving, upholding hand.
Jason Bohn was a college student when he made a hole-in-one golf shot that won him a million dollars
While others may have squandered that money, Bohn had a plan
Wanting to be a pro golfer, he used the money as a living-and-training fund to improve his golf skills
The cash became an investment in his future, an investment that paid off when Bohn won the PGA Tour's 2005 B.C. Open
Bohn's decision to invest in the future instead of living for the moment was a wise one indeed
In a sense, that is what Jesus calls us to do
We have been entrusted with resources, time, ability, opportunity,  and we decide how to use them
Our challenge is to see those resources as an opportunity to invest long-term
'Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,'
is how Jesus put it in Matthew 6:20
Those protected treasures cannot be destroyed nor taken away, Jesus assures us
Think of your resources: talent, time, knowledge
These are temporal and limited
But if you invest them with an eye toward eternity, these temporary things can have enduring impact
What is your focus
Now or forever
Invest in the future
It will not only have an eternal impact, but it will also change the way you view life each day.
I have a friend who was working in his home office one evening, trying to get some necessary paperwork done
His little girl, who was about 4 years old at the time, was playing around his desk, puttering about, moving objects here and there, pulling out drawers, and making a good deal of noise
My friend endured the distraction with stoic patience until the child slammed a drawer on one of her fingers and screamed in pain
Reacting in exasperation he shouted, 'That's it!'
as he escorted her out of the room and shut the door
Later, her mother found her weeping in her bedroom and tried to comfort her
'Does your finger still hurt?'
she asked
'No,'
the little girl sniffled
'Then why are you crying?'
her mother asked
''Cause,'
she whimpered, 'when I pinched my finger, Papa didn't say, '\sOh!''
Sometimes that's all we need, isn't it
Someone who cares and who will respond with kindness and compassion, someone who will say, 'Oh!'
We have One named Jesus who does that for us
Jesus loves us, understands our sorrows, and gave Himself for us
Now we are to 'walk in love'
and imitate Him.
A college football coach in the Bronx built his team around good character qualities
Instead of displaying their names on the back of their jerseys, the Maritime College players displayed words like family, respect, accountability, and character
Before each game, coach Clayton Kendrick-Holmes reminded his team to play by those principles on the field
The apostle Peter had his own list of Christian qualities that he encouraged believers to add to their life of faith: Virtue
Fulfilling God's design for a life with moral excellence
Knowledge
Studying God's Word to gain wisdom to combat falsehood
Self-control
Revering God so much that we choose godly behavior
Perseverance
Having a hopeful attitude even in difficulties because we're confident in God's character
Godliness
Honoring the Lord in every relationship in life
Brotherly kindness
Displaying a warmhearted affection for fellow believers
Love
Sacrificing for the good of others
Let's develop these qualities in increasing measure and integrate them into every part of our life.
Legendary UCLA basketball coach John Wooden had an interesting rule for his teams
Whenever a player scored, he was to acknowledge the person on the team who had assisted
When he was coaching high school, one of his players asked, 'Coach, won't that take up too much time?'
Wooden replied, 'I'm not asking you to run over there and give him a big hug
A nod will do.'
To achieve victory on the basketball court, Wooden saw the importance of teaching his players that they were a team, not 'just a bunch of independent operators.'
Each person contributed to the success of everyone else
That reminds me of the way the body of Christ should work
According to 1 Corinthians 12:19-20, each of us is a separate part of one body
'If they were all one member, where would the body be
there are many members, yet one body.'
Is the success of a pastor, a Bible study, or a church program based solely on one person's accomplishments
How many people contribute to the smooth operation of a church, a Christian organization, a family
Coach Wooden's rule and 1 Corinthians 12 are both rooted in the principle of seeing our need for one another
Let's use our gifts within the body of Christ to build up, strengthen, and help to carry out God's purposes .
Dave Randlett was someone of whom I can say, 'Because of him, my life will never be the same.'
Dave, who went to heaven in October 2010, became a mentor to me when I was a new follower of Jesus in my college years
He not only invested time in me, but he took risks by giving me opportunities to learn and grow in ministry
Dave was God's instrument to give me the opportunity to be a student preacher and travel with a college music team
As a result, he helped shape and prepare me for a life of teaching God's Word
I'm glad I was able to express thanks to him on a number of occasions
Just as I am thankful for Dave's influence in my life, the apostle Paul was grateful for Aquila and Priscilla, who served the Lord with him
He said they 'risked their own necks for my life.'
In gratitude, he thanked them, as did 'all the churches of the Gentiles'
You too may have people in your life who have taken risks by giving you opportunities to serve or who have greatly influenced you spiritually
Perhaps pastors, ministry leaders, friends, or family members have given of themselves to move you further along for Christ
The question is, have you thanked them?
A television program that I enjoy watching has a segment called Ambush Makeover
Two women are chosen to undergo 3 hours of pampering to update their hair, makeup, and wardrobe
The change is often dramatic
When the women step from behind a curtain, the audience gasps
Friends and family members sometimes start to cry
After all of this, the person with the new look finally gets to see herself
Some are so shocked that they keep looking in the mirror as if to find proof that it's really them
As the women walk across the set to join their companions, the former self becomes evident
Most do not know how to walk in their new shoes
Although they look chic, their clumsy walk gives them away
Their transformation is incomplete
This is true in our Christian lives as well
God does the work in us to give us a new start
but to walk in the way of the Lord requires time, effort, and lots of practice
If we just stand still and smile, we can pass as being transformed
But the way we walk tells how far along we are in living out that transformation
Being changed means giving up our previous way of life and learning a new way to walk .
One day when I was waiting to board a plane, a stranger who had overheard me mention that I was a chaplain began to describe to me his life before he met Christ
He said it was marked by 'sin and self-absorption
Then I met Jesus.'
I listened with interest to a list of changes he had made to his life and good deeds he had done
But because everything he told me was about his busyness for God and not his fellowship with God, I wasn't surprised when he added, 'Frankly, chaplain, I thought I'd feel better about myself by now.'
I think the New Testament character Martha would have understood that stranger's observation
Having invited Jesus to be a guest at her home, she set about doing what she thought were the important things
But this meant she couldn't focus on Jesus
Because Mary wasn't helping, Martha felt justified asking Jesus to chide her
It's a mistake many of us make: We're so busy doing good that we don't spend time getting to know God better
My advice to my new airplane friend came from the core of Jesus' words to Martha in Luke 10:41-42
I said to him: 'Slow down and invest yourself in knowing God; let His Word reveal Himself to you.'
If we're too busy to spend time with God, we're simply too busy.
When I was a teenager, my dad and I went on many hunting and fishing trips together
Most became happy memories, but one fishing expedition was nearly a disaster
We drove up into a high mountain range and set up camp in a remote area
Then Dad and I trudged a long way down the mountain to get to a stream to fish
After a long day fishing in the hot sun, it was time to return to camp
But as we began to head back, Dad's face grew pale
He was dizzy and nauseated, and he had almost no strength
Trying not to panic, I had him sit down and drink liquids
Then I prayed aloud to God for help
Bolstered by prayer, rest, and nourishment, Dad improved, and we began to go slowly back up the mountain
He held on to my loosened belt as I crawled upward, leading the way back to camp
Sometimes we find ourselves in what feels like a hopeless valley without the strength to go on
When this happens, it's important to recall God's promise: 'He gives power to the weak, and to those who have no might He increases strength'
Do you feel drained
Exhausted
Ask God for help
Depend on Him for the power to go on and the strength to make it through the valley.
When we quote The Apostles' Creed, we say, 'I believe in the Holy Spirit.'
Author JB Phillips said, 'Every time we say [this] we mean that we believe that [the Spirit] is a living God able and willing to enter human personality and change it.'
Sometimes we forget that the Holy Spirit is not an impersonal force
The Bible describes Him as God
He possesses the attributes of God: He is present everywhere , He knows all things , and He has infinite power
He also does things that only God can do: create and give life
He is equal in every way with the other Persons of the Trinity, the Father and the Son
The Holy Spirit is a Person who engages in personal ways with us
He grieves when we sin
He teaches us , prays for us , guides us , gives us spiritual gifts , and assures us of salvation
The Holy Spirit indwells us if we have received forgiveness of sin through Jesus
He desires to transform us so that we become more and more like Jesus
Let's cooperate with the Spirit by reading God's Word and relying on His power to obey what we learn.
A long-time friend described the days surrounding his 90th birthday as 'a time
to do a little reflecting, looking in the rearview mirror of my life, and spending many hours in what I call '\sThe Grace of Remembrance' 
It's so easy to forget all the ways that the Lord has led
'\sForget not all His benefits'
This was typical of the person I've known and admired for more than 50 years
Rather than reviewing disappointments, his letter was filled with thankfulness and praise to God
First, he recalled the Lord's temporal mercies, his good health, the enjoyment of his wife and children, the joy and success of work, his enriching friendships, and the opportunities he'd had to serve God
He considered them all gifts, none deserved, but all gratefully received
Next, he reviewed God's spiritual mercies, the influence of Christian parents and the experience of God's forgiveness when he accepted Christ as a teenager
He concluded with the encouragement he'd received from churches, schools, and Christian men who cared and prayed for each other
It's a model we should follow on a regular basis, the joy of remembering
'Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless His holy name!'
During a documentary on World War I, the narrator said that if Britain's casualties in 'the war to end all wars'
were marched four abreast past London's war monument, the processional would take 7 days to complete
This staggering word picture set my mind spinning at the awful cost of war
While those costs include monetary expense, destruction of property, and economic interruption, none of these compare to the human cost
Both soldiers and civilians pay the ultimate price, multiplied exponentially by the grief of the survivors
War is costly
When believers go to war with one another, the cost is also high
James wrote, 'Where do wars and fights come from among you
Do they not come from your desires for pleasure that war in your members?'
In our own selfish pursuits, we sometimes battle without considering the price exacted on our witness to the world or our relationships with one another
Perhaps that is why James preceded these words with the challenge, 'Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace'
If we are to represent the Prince of Peace in our world, believers need to stop fighting with one another and practice peace.
When it was learned that the biggest football game of the 2011 season was scheduled to be played on Yom Kippur, the student government at the University of Texas petitioned school officials to change the date
They said it was unfair to make Jewish students choose between the classic football rivalry with Oklahoma and observing their most important and sacred holy day of the year
But the date was not changed
Even in societies where people have religious freedom, difficult choices are still required of every person of faith
Daniel demonstrated the courage to obey God no matter what the consequences
When his political rivals set a trap to eliminate him from their path to power , he didn't challenge the law or complain that he had been wronged
'When Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went home
And in his upper room, with his windows open toward Jerusalem, he knelt down on his knees three times that day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as was his custom since early days'
Daniel didn't know if God would save him from the lions' den, but it didn't matter
He chose to honor God in his life whatever the outcome
Like Daniel, we are free to choose to follow the Lord.
Usually we're told to smile before someone takes our picture
But in some parts of the US, a no-smiling policy is enforced when getting your photo taken for a driver's license
Because of identity theft, these motor vehicle departments carefully check new photos that are taken to be sure they don't match photos already in the system
If someone gets a picture taken under a false name, an alarm is sent to the operator
From 1999 to 2009, one state stopped 6,000 people from getting fraudulent licenses
But why no smiling
The technology recognizes a face more easily if the person has a neutral facial expression
Jesus prescribed a good way to recognize a Christian
He told His disciples, 'By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another'
The ways to show love to fellow believers are as endless as there are people with needs: a note of encouragement, a visit, a meal, a gentle rebuke, a prayer, a Bible verse, a listening ear, even just a friendly smile
The apostle John wrote, 'We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren'
Can others recognize, by our care for fellow Christians, that we know and love the Lord?
I was frustrated that despite my repeated calls, the streetlight in front of my house was still out
Because we don't have sidewalks and there is such a large distance between the streetlights, it's important that each light is functional to illuminate the darkness
I worried that I might hit one of the school kids as I pulled out of my driveway in the early morning hours
The idea of light is used frequently in the Bible
Jesus said that He is the Light of the world
We are told to 'put on the armor of light'
by clothing ourselves with the Lord
And Matthew 5:16 instructs that we should 'let [our] light so shine before men, that they may see [our] good works and glorify [our] Father in heaven.'
A light that doesn't shine has lost its usefulness
Jesus said that no one hides a light under a basket but puts it on a lampstand to illuminate everything around it
Our light should point people to the One who is the Light
We don't have any light in ourselves, but we shine with the reflection of Christ
God has placed each of us in a specific environment that will best allow us to shine with His light
Don't be like a burned-out streetlight
Shine on!
Buying and selling real estate in the US is tricky business these days
Housing prices have dropped significantly, and if you're trying to unload commercial property it's even more difficult
So, in the game of real estate, it remains important to keep this old adage in mind: 'The three most important things to know about buying and selling property are location, location, location!'
The same is true of living for Jesus
Knowing our location spiritually is critical if we are to succeed in navigating through the greatly devalued territory of our world
Paul reminds us that we have a new location in Christ, having been delivered 'from the power of darkness and conveyed into the kingdom of the Son'
Knowing that we have been relocated by His amazing grace into the kingdom of Jesus makes a difference
Jesus now reigns as King in our hearts and minds, and we are His grateful subjects
His will is our will and His ways become patterns for all of life and behavior
And when we are forced to make a choice, our allegiance is to Him
So, when the temptations and the seductions of the darkness from which you have been removed threaten His reign in your heart, remember your new postal code: Colossians 1:13!
When the deck behind our house began caving in, I knew its repair would exceed my abilities
So I made some calls, got some bids, and picked a builder to construct a new deck
Once the contractor was done, I took a close look at his work and noticed some problems
Seeking a second opinion, I called the local building inspector and got a surprise
The deck guy had not obtained a building permit
Working without official oversight, he had violated many points of the building code
This incident reminded me of an important truth : We often do less than our best if we don't have any accountability to the authority over us
In Scripture, we see this principle explained in two of Jesus' parables
In both cases, at least one unsupervised worker failed when the master was gone
But then we see a different approach in Proverbs 6
We see the example of the ant, which does good work without a visible supervisor
It intrinsically does its work without being monitored
What about us
Do we do good work only when someone is watching
Or do we recognize that all our service is for God, and so do our best at all times, even when no human authority is watching?
Thomas Moore was an Irish songwriter, singer, and poet
His talents brought joy to many who saw him perform or who sang his music
Yet, tragically, his personal life was troubled by repeated heartaches, including the death of all five of his children during his lifetime
Moore's personal wounds make these words of his all the more meaningful: 'Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish; earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.'
This moving statement reminds us that meeting with God in prayer can bring healing to the troubled soul
The apostle Paul also saw how our heavenly Father can provide solace to the hurting heart
To the believers at Corinth he wrote: 'Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our tribulation'
Sometimes, though, we can be so preoccupied with an inner sorrow that we isolate ourselves from the One who can offer consolation
We need to be reminded that God's comfort and healing come through prayer
As we confide in our Father, we can experience peace and the beginning of healing for our wounded hearts
For truly 'earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.'?
My next record should be 45 minutes of silence,'
said singer Meg Hutchinson, 'because that's what we're missing most in society.'
Silence is indeed hard to find
Cities are notoriously noisy due to the high concentration of traffic and people
There seems to be no escape from loud music, loud machines, and loud voices
But the kind of noise that endangers our spiritual well-being is not the noise we can't escape but the noise we invite into our lives
Some of us use noise as a way of shutting out loneliness: voices of TV and radio personalities give us the illusion of companionship
Some of us use it as a way of shutting out our own thoughts: other voices and opinions keep us from having to think for ourselves
Some of us use noise as a way of shutting out the voice of God: constant chatter, even when we're talking about God, keeps us from hearing what God has to say
But Jesus, even during His busiest times, made a point of seeking out places of solitude where He could carry on a conversation with God
Even if we can't find a place that is perfectly quiet, we need to find a place to quiet our souls , a place where God has our full attention.
Driving home from work, I heard a radio advertisement that got my attention
It was for a computer program that checks e-mails as they are written
I was familiar with spell check and grammar check programs, but this was different
This was 'tone check.'
The software monitors the tone and wording of e-mails to make certain they are not overly aggressive, unkind, or mean-spirited
As I listened to the announcer describe the features of this software, I wondered what it would be like to have something like that for my mouth
How many times have I reacted harshly instead of listening first, and later regretted the words I had spoken
Certainly a tone check would have protected me from responding so foolishly
Paul saw the need for us as believers to check our speech, especially when talking to those who are not Christians
He said, 'Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one'
His concern was that our speech be graceful, reflecting the beauty of our Savior and it must be inviting to others
Talking with the right tone to unbelievers is vital to our ability to witness to them
Colossians 4:6 can be our tone check.
In his book Long for This World, Jonathan Weiner writes about science's promise to radically extend how long we live
At the center of the book is English scientist Aubrey de Grey, who predicts that science will one day offer us 1,000-year lifespans
Aubrey claims that molecular biology has finally placed a cure for aging within our reach
But what difference does it make if, after living 1,000 years, we will eventually die anyway
De Grey's prediction only postpones facing the ultimate question of what happens when we die
It does not answer it
The Scriptures tell us that death is not the end of our existence
Instead, we are assured that everyone will stand before Christ, believers for their works and nonbelievers for their rejection of Him
All of us are sinners and in need of forgiveness
And only Christ's death on the cross has provided forgiveness for all who believe
The Bible says, 'It is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment'
Our appointed face-to-face encounter with God puts everything in perspective
So whether we live 70 years or 1,000, the issue of eternity is the same: 'Prepare to meet your God!'
While visiting the ruins of Hadrian's Wall in Northern England, I reflected on the fact that this may be the most remembered achievement of the Roman emperor who came to power in ad 117
As many as 18,000 Roman soldiers manned this 80-mile-long barrier, built to keep the northern barbarians from invading the south
Hadrian is remembered for building a physical wall to keep people out
In contrast, Jesus Christ is remembered for tearing down a spiritual wall to let people in
When the early church experienced tension between believers of Jewish and non-Jewish birth, Paul told them that, through Christ, they stood equally in the family of God
'For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation
so as to create in Himself one new man from the two, thus making peace
For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father'
One of the most beautiful aspects of the Christian faith is the unity among those who follow Jesus
Through His death on the cross, Christ has removed the barriers that so often separate people and has drawn us together in true friendship and love.
It can be quite discouraging for wanna-be writers to get their work rejected time after time
When they send in a manuscript to a publisher, they'll often hear back in a letter with these words: 'Thank you
But your submission does not meet our needs at this time.'
Sometimes this really means 'not at this time, or ever.'
So they try the next publisher and the next
I've found that the phrase This does not meet our needs at this time, or ever can be a helpful saying in my Christian walk to renew my mind and refocus my thoughts on the Lord
Here's what I mean
When starting to worry, we can remind ourselves: 'Worry does not meet my needs at this time, or ever
My heart's need is to trust God
I will '\sbe anxious for nothing' '
When we envy what another person has or does, we can reinforce the truth: 'Envy does not meet my needs at this time, or ever
My need is to give thanks to God
His Word says, '\sEnvy is rottenness to the bones' , and '\sIn everything give thanks' '
We can't renew our minds by ourselves ; it's the transforming work of the Holy Spirit who lives in us
Yet speaking the truth in our thoughts can help us to submit to the Spirit's work within.
Conventional wisdom questions how much can be accomplished with little
We tend to believe that a lot more can be done if we have large financial resources, talented manpower, and innovative ideas
But these things don't matter to God
Consider just a couple of examples: In Judges 3:31, a relatively unknown man named Shamgar delivered Israel from the Philistines single-handedly
How He won a great victory by killing 600 Philistines with nothing more than an oxgoad
In Exodus, when God asked Moses to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt, Moses was afraid the people wouldn't listen to him or follow him
So God said, 'What is that in your hand?'
Moses replied, 'A rod.'
God went on to use that rod in Moses' hand to convince the people to follow him, to turn the Nile River into blood, to bring great plagues on Egypt, to part the Red Sea, and to perform miracles in the wilderness
Moses' rod and Shamgar's oxgoad, when dedicated to God, became mighty tools
This helps us see that God can use what little we have, when surrendered to Him, to do great things
God is not looking for people with great abilities, but for those who are dedicated to following and obeying Him.
Before she was 2 years old, my granddaughter Katie did something that would make any grandpa proud: She began to recognize cars by make and year
This all started when she and her daddy began spending time together playing with his old collection of toy cars
Daddy would say, 'Katie, get the 1957 Chevy,'
and she would pick it out of the hundreds of tiny cars
And once, while he was reading a Curious George book to her, she climbed down from his lap and ran to get a miniature Rolls Royce, an exact replica of the car pictured in the book
If a 2-year-old child can make such connections, doesn't that show the importance of teaching children the right things early on
We can do this by using what I call the FIRM principle: Familiarity, Interest, Recognition, and Modeling
This follows Moses' pattern in Deuteronomy 6 of taking every opportunity to teach biblical truths so that children become familiar with them and make them a part of their lives
Using their interests as teaching opportunities, we repeat Bible stories so they become recognizable, while modeling a godly life before them
Let's give the children in our lives a FIRM foundation by teaching them about God's love, Christ's salvation, and the importance of godly living.
Someone once asked me why she should be like Jesus now since she would become like Him when she got to heaven
Great question
Especially when it's easier to just be yourself
Actually, there are several reasons why becoming like Him now is important, but one is near the top
When we see and stand before Him, we will give an account as to whether or not we lived in ways that were consistent with His will
Or, as Paul put it, whether or not we have built on Him as our foundation with 'gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, [or] straw'
All that we do to advance His kingdom, things like contribute to the strength of His church, serve the poor and needy, and promote righteousness and justice as He did, is like building with essential materials that will survive the fire of His judgment
On the contrary, building with things that reflect our fallen ways, and living to advance ourselves and our earthly desires are commodities that will turn into a pile of ashes before the consuming fire of His glory
I don't know about you, but I'd rather love Jesus enough to live like Him now, for the thought of standing before Him in a heap of ashes is an unthinkable alternative.
It happened again
I got the urge to clean my office
Before I could resist, I had created an even bigger mess than I started with
One pile turned into many piles when I started sorting books, papers, and magazines
As the mess mushroomed, I lamented that I had started
But there was no going back
When God recruited Moses to rescue the Hebrews from slavery, their situation went from bad to worse as well
There was no doubt that the job needed to be done
The people had been crying out to God to help them
Reluctantly, very reluctantly, Moses agreed to appeal to Pharaoh on behalf of the Hebrews
The encounter did not go well
Instead of releasing the people, Pharaoh increased his unreasonable demands
Moses questioned whether he should have started
Only after a lot more trouble for a lot of people did Pharaoh let the people leave
Whenever we set out to do something good, even when we're certain that God wants us to do it, we shouldn't be surprised when the situation gets worse before it gets better
This doesn't prove that we're doing the wrong thing; it just reminds us that we need God to accomplish everything.
Recently I was called for jury duty
It meant extraordinary inconvenience and lots of lost time, but it was also serious business
During the first day's orientation, the judge lectured us on the responsibility at hand and the important nature of the task
We were going to sit in judgment of people who either had disputes or were charged with crimes
I felt a great sense of inadequacy for the task at hand
Passing judgment on another person, with serious life consequences riding on the decision, is not a simple thing
Because we're flawed human beings, we may not always make the right judgments
While the justice systems of our world might struggle and falter because of the inherent failings of the humans that manage them, we can always trust our God to excel in wisdom and fairness
The psalmist sang, 'The Lord reigns; the world also is firmly established, it shall not be moved; He shall judge the peoples righteously'
God judges according to righteousness, defined by His own perfect justice and flawless character
We can trust God now when life seems unfair, knowing that He will one day make all things right in His final court 
Dr Jack Mezirow, professor emeritus at Columbia Teachers College, believes that an essential element in adult learning is to challenge our own ingrained perceptions and examine our insights critically
Dr Mezirow says that adults learn best when faced with what he calls a 'disorienting dilemma'?, something that 'helps you critically reflect on the assumptions you've acquired'
This is the opposite of saying, 'My mind is made up, don't confuse me with the facts.'
When Jesus healed on the Sabbath, He challenged the deeply held beliefs of many religious leaders, and they sought to silence Him
Jesus said to them: 'You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me
But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life'
Oswald Chambers observed, 'God has a way of bringing in facts which upset a man's doctrines if these stand in the way of God getting at his soul.'
Unsettling experiences that cause us to question our assumptions about the Lord can also lead us to a deeper understanding and trust in Him, if we're willing to think it through and come to Him.
Has your heart ever been broken
What broke it
Cruelty
Failure
Unfaithfulness
Loss
Perhaps you've crept into the darkness to cry
It's good to cry
'Tears are the only cure for weeping,'
said Scottish preacher George MacDonald
A little crying does one good
Jesus wept at His friend Lazarus' grave , and He weeps with us
His heart was broken as well
Our tears attract our Lord's lovingkindness and tender care
He knows our troubled, sleepless nights
His heart aches for us when we mourn
He is the 'God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our tribulation'
And He uses His people to comfort one another
But tears and our need for comfort come back all too frequently in this life
Present comfort is not the final answer
There is a future day when there will be no death, no sorrow, no crying, for all these things will 'have passed away'
There in heaven God will wipe away every tear
We are so dear to our Father that He will be the one who wipes the tears away from our eyes; He loves us so deeply and personally
Remember, 'Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted'
Many will remember the fall season of 2008 as the beginning of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of 1929
In the months to follow, many lost their jobs, homes, and investments
In a BBC interview a year later, Alan Greenspan, former head of the US Federal Reserve, indicated that the average person doesn't believe it will happen again
He said, 'That is the unquenchable capability of human beings when confronted with long periods of prosperity to presume that it will continue.'
Assuming that things will continue as they always have is not just 21st-century-type thinking
In the first century, Peter wrote of people who thought that life would continue as it was and that Jesus would not return
He said, 'Since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation'
Jesus said He would come back, but the people continued to live in disobedience as though He would never return
But His delay is only because of God's patience with us, for He is 'not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance'
Paul tells us that Christians ought to live 'soberly, right­eously, and godly'
in the light of Christ's certain return
Are you ready to meet Him?
Most of us would agree that life has its ups and downs
Wise King Solomon believed this and reflected on our responses to fluctuating circumstances
In Ecclesiastes, he wrote: 'To everything there is a season, a time for every purpose under heaven:
a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance'
Solomon's father, David, was called 'a man after [God's] own heart'
Yet David's life illustrates how life is filled with seasons of ups and downs
David wept over his and Bathsheba's first child who was fatally ill
Yet he also wrote songs of praise and joyous laughter
With the death of his rebellious son Absalom, David experienced a time of deep mourning
And when the ark was brought to Jerusalem, David, in spiritual ecstasy, danced before the Lord
We do a disservice to ourselves and others when we portray the Christian life as peaceful and happy all the time
Instead, the Bible portrays the believer's life as consisting of seasons of ups and downs
In what season are you
Whether a time of joy or sadness, each season should motivate us to seek the Lord and trust Him.
Twenty-month-old James was leading his family confidently through the hallways of their large church
His daddy kept an eye on him the whole time as James toddled his way through the crowd of 'giants.'
Suddenly the little boy panicked because he could not see his dad
He stopped, looked around, and started to cry, 'Daddy, Daddy!'
His dad quickly caught up with him and little James reached up his hand, which Daddy strongly clasped
Immediately James was at peace
Second Kings tells the story of King Hezekiah who reached up to God for help
Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, had made threats against Hezekiah and the people of Judah, saying, 'Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you
You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by utterly destroying them; and shall you be delivered?'
King Hezekiah went to the Lord and prayed for deliverance so 'that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are the Lord God'
In answer to his prayer, the angel of the Lord struck down the enemy, and Sennacherib withdrew
If you're in a situation where you need God's help, reach up your hand to Him in prayer
He has promised His comfort and help .
The first time I saw her, I fell in love
She was a beauty
Sleek
Clean
Radiant
As soon as I spied the 1962 Ford Thunderbird at the used-car lot, her shiny exterior and killer interior beckoned me
I knew this was the car for me
So I plunked down $800 and purchased my very first car
But there was a problem lurking inside my prized possession
A few months after I bought my T-Bird, it suddenly became particular about which way I could go
It allowed me to go forward, but I couldn't go backward
It had no reverse
Although not having reverse is a problem in a car, sometimes it's good for us to be a little like my old T-Bird
We need to keep going forward, without the possibility of putting life into reverse
In our walk with Jesus, we need to refuse to go backward
Paul said it simply: We need to 'press toward the goal'
Perhaps the children of Israel could have used my T-Bird's transmission
We read in Exodus 16 that they were in danger of putting life into reverse
Despite the many miracles God had performed, they longed for Egypt and failed to trust that He could guide them forward
We need to keep moving ahead in our walk with God
Don't back up
Look forward
Press on.
The Israelites and the Philistines were at war
While Saul relaxed under a pomegranate tree with his men, Jonathan and his armor-bearer left camp quietly to see if the Lord would work on their behalf, believing that 'nothing restrains the Lord from saving by many or by few'
Jonathan and his helper were about to cross a path between two high cliffs
Armed enemy soldiers were stationed above them on both sides
They were two men against who knows how many
When Jonathan suggested they climb up after them, the armor-bearer never flinched
'Do all that is in your heart,'
he told Jonathan
'I am with you, according to your heart'
So the two climbed the cliff, and with God's help they overcame the enemy
We have to admire this courageous young armor-bearer
He lugged the armor up that cliff and stayed with Jonathan, following along behind and killing those Jonathan wounded
The church needs strong leaders to face our spiritual foes, but they must not be left to face them alone
They need the help and support of everyone in the congregation, loyal 'armor-bearers'
like you and me who are willing to join them in battle against the 'enemy of our souls.'?
One day I found my son straining to lift a pair of four-pound barbells over his head, an ambitious feat for a toddler
He had raised them only a few inches off the ground, but his eyes were determined and his face was pink with effort
I offered to help, and together we heaved the weight up toward the ceiling
The heavy lifting that was so hard for him was easy for me
Jesus has this perspective on the stuff that's hard for us to manage
When life seems like a carousel of catastrophes, Jesus isn't fazed by a fender-bender, troubled by a toothache, or harassed by a heated argument, even if it all happens in one day
He can handle anything, and that is why He said, 'Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden'
Are you worn out from ongoing problems
Are you weighed down with stress and worry
Jesus is the only real solution
Approaching the Lord in prayer allows us to cast our burdens on Him so that He can sustain us
Today, ask Him to assist you with everything
By helping you with your burdens, He can supply rest for your soul, for His yoke is easy and His burden is light .
&#8220;Lacks ambition.'
That is not a phrase you want to see on your performance review
When it comes to work, employees who lack ambition seldom rise to the top of an organization
Without a strong desire to achieve something, nothing is accomplished
Ambition, however, has a dark side
It often has more to do with elevating self than with accomplishing something noble for others
This was the case with many of the kings of Israel, including the first one
Saul started out with humility, but he gradually came to consider his position as something that belonged to him
He forgot that he had a special assignment from God to lead His chosen people in a way that would show other nations the way to God
When God relieved him of duty, Saul's only concern was for himself
In a world where ambition often compels people to do whatever it takes to rise to positions of power over others, God calls His people to a new way of living
We are to do nothing out of selfish ambition and to lay aside the weight of sin that ensnares us
If you want to be someone who truly 'rises up,'
make it your ambition to humbly love and serve God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength .
It seems that young people in China are beginning to forget how to write the characters that comprise the beautiful calligraphy of their traditional language
Some are calling the phenomenon 'character amnesia.'
Heavy usage of computers and smart phones often means that writing is neglected and some can no longer remember the characters they learned in childhood
One young man said, 'People don't write anything by hand anymore except for [their] name and address.'
Some people appear to have 'character amnesia'
of a different sort
When faced with a dilemma, they seem to 'forget'
the right thing to do and instead choose the easy way out
God called Job 'a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil'
God allowed Satan to take everything Job had, his children, his wealth, and his health
But despite his heart-wrenching circumstances, Job refused to curse God
'In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong'
Satan had challenged God's assertion of Job's blameless character, but he was proven wrong
Character amnesia
No
Character is who we are; it's not something we 'forget'
As I was talking with a gentleman whose wife had died, he shared with me that a friend said to him, 'I'm sorry you lost your wife.'
His reply
'Oh, I haven't lost her; I know exactly where she is!'
To some this may seem like a rather bold or even flippant assertion
With so many after-death theories, one might wonder how we can be really sure where our loved ones go after death, let alone where we ourselves will end up
Yet, confidence is appropriate for followers of Jesus Christ
We have the assurance from God's Word that when we die we will immediately be with our Lord
Thankfully, this is more than just wishful thinking
It is grounded in the historic reality of Jesus, who came and died to cancel our penalty for sin so that we could receive eternal life
He then proved that there was life after death by exiting His grave and ascending into heaven where, as He promised, He is preparing a place for us
So, rejoice
Since the benefits of this reality are out of this world, we can boldly say with Paul that 'we are confident, yes, well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord'
Today marks the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks in the US on September 11, 2001
It's hard to think about that date without mental images of the destruction, grief, and loss that swept over America and the world following those tragic events
The loss of thousands of lives was compounded by the depth of loss felt corporately, a lost sense of security as a country
The sorrow of loss, personal and corporate, will always accompany the memory of the events of that day
Those horrific events are not the only painful memories of September 11
It also marks the anniversary of my father-in-law's death
Jim's loss is felt deeply within our family and his circle of friends
No matter what kind of sorrow we experience, there is only one real comfort, the mercy of God
David, in his own heartache, cried to his heavenly Father, 'Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am in trouble; my eye wastes away with grief, yes, my soul and my body!'
Only in the mercy of God can we find comfort for our pain and peace for our troubled hearts
In all losses, we can turn to the true Shepherd, Jesus Christ, who alone can heal our brokenness and grief.
When US airspace was closed after the September 11, 2001, attacks, planes had to land at the closest airport available
Nearly 40 planes landed in Gander, Newfoundland
Suddenly this small Canadian community almost doubled in size when thousands of frightened passengers arrived
People opened their homes, and officials converted high schools, lodges, churches, and meeting halls into places to stay
Stranded passengers were overwhelmed with neighborly generosity and kindness
The people of Gander showed the kind of love described in Hebrews 13: 'Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some have unwittingly entertained angels'
This is probably referring to Abraham when he entertained three men who came to tell him that he would soon have a son
Two of the 'men'
were angels, and one was the Angel of the Lord
Bruce says about Abraham, 'Among the Jews, Abraham was regarded as outstanding for his hospitality as [he was] for his other virtues; a true son of Abraham must be hospitable too.'
God calls believers to show their love and gratefulness for Him in their good works of hospitality and compassion
How will you answer His call today?
During my seminary years, I directed a summer day camp for boys and girls at the YMCA
Each morning, I began the day with a brief story in which I tried to incorporate an element of the gospel
To help illustrate that becoming a Christian means to become a new creation in Christ, I told a story about a moose that wanted to be a horse
The moose had seen a herd of wild horses, thought them elegant creatures, and wanted to be like them
So he taught himself to act like a horse
However, he was never accepted as a horse because he was a moose
How can a moose become a horse
Only by being born a horse, of course
And then I would explain how we can all be born again by believing in Jesus
One summer I had a staff counselor named Henry who was very hostile to the faith
I could do nothing but love him and pray for him, but he left at the end of the summer hardened in unbelief
That was more than 50 years ago
A few years ago I received a letter from Henry
The first sentence said: 'I write to tell that I have been born again and now, at last, I am a 'horse'
This confirmed to me that we need to keep praying and planting the seed of the Word so that it may bear fruit one day.
In 1876, Henry Clay Work wrote the song 'My Grandfather's Clock.'
The song describes a grandfather's clock that faithfully ticks its way through its owner's life
Childhood, adulthood, and old age are all viewed in relationship to his beloved timepiece
The refrain says: Ninety years without slumbering,  Tick, tock, tick, tock,  His life's seconds numbering,  Tick, tock, tick, tock,  But it stopped, short,  Never to go again,  When the old man died
The relentless ticking of the clock reminds us that our time on earth is limited
Despite the joys and pains of life, time always marches on
For the believer, our time on earth is an opportunity for gaining wisdom
The psalmist writes, 'Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom'
One way of numbering our days is to ask ourselves these kinds of questions: How can I become more like Christ
Am I reading the Word regularly
Am I devoting time to prayer
Am I meeting together with other believers
The way we answer these questions is an indicator of the progress we're making in gaining wisdom and becoming more like Christ
No matter the phase of life, childhood, youth, middle age, or our senior years, life always affords us opportunities to grow in faith and wisdom
Numbering our days is the wise response to life's inevitable progress
How are you progressing on your journey?
During the past 135 years of Major League Baseball, only 20 pitchers have thrown a perfect game
On June 2, 2010, Armando Galarraga of the Detroit Tigers would have been number 21 but an umpire's mistake denied him what every pitcher dreams of
The video replay showed the truth
Even though the umpire later acknowledged his error and apologized to Galarraga, the call made on the field could not be changed
Through it all, Galarraga remained calm, expressed sympathy for the umpire, and never criticized him
Armando's refusal to retaliate amazed fans, players, and sportswriters alike
If we insist on fair treatment for ourselves, we can become angry and frustrated
But when we embrace the Bible's wisdom, we will seek the welfare of others
Proverbs calls us 'to perceive the words of understanding, to receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, judgment, and equity'
Oswald Chambers said of our personal dealings with others, 'Never look for justice, but never cease to give it; and never allow anything you meet with to sour your relationship to men through Jesus Christ.'
When we experience unfairness, it is our privilege and responsibility as followers of Christ to respond with honesty and integrity, doing what is right, just, and fair.
When a high school student tried using a thermometer to measure a table, his teacher was dumbfounded
In 15 years of teaching, Dave had seen many sad and shocking situations
But even he was amazed that a student could make it to high school without knowing the difference between a ruler and a thermometer
When a friend told me this story, my heart broke for that student and others like him who have fallen so far behind in their education
They can't move forward because they haven't yet learned basic lessons of everyday life
But then a sobering thought came to me: Don't we sometimes do the same thing when we use wrong spiritual measuring devices
For example, do we assume that churches with the most resources are the most blessed by God
do we ever think that popular preachers are more godly than those with few followers
The proper measure of our spiritual condition is the quality of our lives, which is measured by such attributes as lowliness, gentleness, and longsuffering
'Bearing with one another in love'
is a good indication that we are moving toward God's goal for us: 'the measure of the fullness of Christ'
Some Christians grow up believing work is bad, that it's a curse brought about by Adam and Eve's sin
Left uncorrected, this mistaken belief can cause people to feel that what they do in their jobs every day isn't important to God, or at the very least, isn't as important as the work of missionaries and pastors
This is not true, as Genesis 1:26-31 teaches us
First, we learn that God Himself works, as evidenced by the labor involved in creation and by the fact that He rested on the seventh day
Then we discover that we were made in His image and that we were granted dominion over creation
This implies that we are to work to tend creation
Clearly, the tending of God's creation is work, noble work, for God looked upon His labors and declared them 'very good'
It mustn't escape our notice either that work was declared good before sin entered the picture
In other words, work didn't result from the fall and therefore is not a curse
We see this idea again in Genesis 2, when God 'took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to tend and keep it'
Let's approach each day's labor, whether at a job or doing another activity to help our family, with an awareness of the dignity and nobility God granted it in creation.
One of the highlights of my work as a college president is commencement
while walking to the graduation ceremony, I was excited by the thought that our graduates were ready to go out to engage the world with the transforming power of the kingdom of Christ
On my way, I noticed some industrious ants busily going about their routine
I thought, There are much greater things happening than the building of sand piles
It's easy for us to get lost in 'ant world'?, to be so busy with our routines that we miss the joy of personally embracing the bigger picture of God's great work around the world
The work of the Spirit is sweeping across South America, thousands in Africa are coming to know Christ daily, persecuted Christians are thriving, and the Asian Rim is throbbing with the pulse of the gospel
Do those thoughts ever capture your heart
Your prayer life
Your checkbook
Our preoccupation with lesser things reminds me of Paul's report that 'Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world'
I wonder if Demas regretted abandoning the gospel for the sand piles of this world
Let's get out of 'ant world' and engage our hearts and lives in spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Following the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, we were all overwhelmed by the images of devastation and hardship endured by the people of that tiny nation
Of the many heartbreaking pictures, one captured my attention
It showed a woman staring at the massive destruction, and weeping
Her mind could not process the suffering of her people, and as her heart was crushed, tears poured from her eyes
Her reaction was understandable
Sometimes crying is the only appropriate response to the suffering we encounter
As I examined that picture, I thought of the compassion of our Lord
Jesus understood the need for tears, and He too wept
But He wept over a different kind of devastation, the destruction brought on by sin
As He approached Jerusalem, marked by corruption and injustice and the pain they create, His response was tears
'Now as He drew near, He saw the city and wept over it'
Jesus wept out of compassion and grief
As we encounter the inhumanity, suffering, and sin that wreak havoc in our world, how do we respond
If the heart of Christ breaks over the broken condition of our world, shouldn't ours
And shouldn't we then do everything we can to make a difference for those in need, both spiritually and physically?
When I was a kid, I had a hero: Pete Maravich, a high-scoring basketball player who handled the ball like a magician
Problem was, my desire to be like Pistol Pete blocked my satisfaction with who God made me to be
When I realized I could never play like Pete, I grew discouraged
I even quit my college team briefly because I couldn't measure up to the Maravich standard
Kids still do that kind of thing
They grow unhappy with who God made them to be because they measure themselves by their 'perfect' heroes
Christian singer Jonny Diaz recognized this and wrote a song called 'More Beautiful You.'
The song begins: 'Little girl fourteen flipping through a magazine; says she wants to look that way.'
Some young girls wish they could be like Disney star Selena Gomez or another star the way I wanted to be like Maravich
Diaz sings, 'There could never be a more beautiful you; don't buy the lies
you were made to fill a purpose that only you could do.'
Diaz is saying what another songwriter said under the inspiration of God thousands of years ago: '[We are] fearfully and wonderfully made'
God made us the way He wants us to be
Believe it
There could never be a more beautiful you.
One Sunday at the church where I pastor, I invited three children to find several scrolls with Bible verses written on them that I had hidden in our worship center
I told them that once they found them and read the words aloud, I would give them a prize
You should have seen those kids
They ran, moved chairs, and looked under plants and in purses
Their search for the scrolls was intense, but exciting
Their diligent search and subsequent discovery of the scrolls led to joy in the children, affirmation from our congregation, and a renewed sense of the importance of God's Word
In 2 Kings 22'\s23, we read how King Josiah and the people of Judah rediscovered the joy and importance of God's Word
During the repairing of the temple, Hilkiah the high priest found the Book of the Law
It must have been lost or hidden during the reign of Manasseh
Then when the scroll was read to King Josiah, he listened and responded to it
He sought further understanding of it , and he led the people to renew their commitment to its importance in their lives
Many today have unprecedented access to God's Word
Let's renew our commitment to 'find'
it every day and by our lives show its prominence.
Just before our church service began, I overheard a young man behind me talking with his mother
They were reading an announcement in the bulletin about a challenge to read one chapter of Proverbs each day for the months of July and August
He asked his mom, 'What will we do with chapter 31 in August since there are only 30 days?'
She said she thought there were 31 days in August
He responded, 'No, there are only 30.'
When it was time in the service to greet each other, I turned back toward him and said hello
Then I added, 'August does have 31 days.'
He insisted, No, it doesn't
There can't be 2 months in a row with 31 days.
The singing started, so I just smiled
This brief encounter made me think about our need to develop a teachable spirit, seeking wisdom beyond our own
In Proverbs 3, the attitude the father recommends to the son is one of humility: 'Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord'
In chapter 2, he says, 'Incline your ear to wisdom
; search for her as for hidden treasures'
Knowing whether August has 30 or 31 days doesn't matter much, but having a teachable spirit does
It will help us gain wisdom from God and others
Reading a chapter from Proverbs each day next month may give us a start.
The Ironman Triathlon consists of a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride, and a 26.2-mile run
It is not an easy feat for anyone to accomplish
But Dick Hoyt participated in the race and completed it with his physically disabled son Rick
When Dick swam, he pulled Rick in a small boat
When Dick cycled, Rick was in a seat-pod on the bike
When Dick ran, he pushed Rick along in a wheelchair
Rick was dependent on his dad in order to finish the race
He couldn't do it without him
We see a parallel between their story and our own Christian life
Just as Rick was dependent on his dad, we are dependent on Christ to complete our Christian race
As we strive to live a God-pleasing life, we realize that in spite of our best intentions and determination, we often stumble and fall short
By our strength alone, it is impossible
Oh, how we need the Lord's help
And it has been provided
Paul declares it with these insightful words, 'It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me
And the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God'
We cannot finish the Christian race on our own
We have to do so by depending on Jesus living in us.
Are you part of the problem or part of the solution
Whether that question is posed during a business meeting, a church council, or a family discussion, it often springs from a sense of exasperation in trying to comprehend why someone has acted in a certain way
More often than not, the answer is a matter of perspective
If we had been among the Israelites leaving Egypt after 400 years of slavery, we would likely have seen Pharaoh as part of the problem, and he was
Yet God saw something more
Inexplicably, the Lord told Moses to take the people back toward Egypt and camp with their backs to the Red Sea 
So Pharaoh would attack them
The Israelites thought they were going to die, but God said that He would gain glory and honor for Himself through Pharaoh and all his army, 'and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord'
When we simply cannot understand why God allows circumstances that threaten to overwhelm us, it's good to remember that He has our good and His glory in mind
If we can say, 'Father, please enable me to trust and honor You in this situation,'
then we will be in concert with His perspective and plan.
We live in the woods, so we get very little prolonged sunlight in the summer
But we love fresh tomatoes, so I decided to try growing them in pots set in a few sunny spots
The plants started to grow right away and really fast
I was thrilled, until I realized that their fast growth was due to their efforts to reach out to the limited sunlight
By the time I figured out what was happening, the vines were too heavy to support themselves
I found some stakes, lifted the vines carefully, and fastened them in an upright position
Even though I tried to be gentle, one of the twisted vines broke when I tried to straighten it
This reminded me that discipline must begin before character is permanently bent and twisted
Eli the priest had two sons whom he failed to discipline
When their wickedness got so bad that he could no longer ignore it, he tried gentle rebuke
But it was too late, and God announced the dire consequences: 'I will judge [Eli's] house forever for the iniquity which he knows, because his sons made themselves vile, and he did not restrain them'
Being straightened out is painful, but being left crooked will ultimately hurt even more.
As a college student, I heard count- less engagement stories
My starry-eyed friends told about glitzy restaurants, mountaintop sunsets, and rides in horse-drawn carriages
I also recall one story about a young man who simply washed his girlfriend's feet
His 'modest proposal'
proved he understood that humility is vital for a lifelong commitment
The apostle Paul also understood the significance of humility and how it holds us together
This is especially important in marriage
Paul said to reject 'me-first'
urges: 'Let nothing be done through selfish ambition'
Instead, we should value our spouses more than ourselves, and look out for their interests
Humility in action means serving our spouse, and no act of service is too small or too great
After all, Jesus 'humbled Himself
to the point of death, even the death of the cross'
His selflessness showed His love for us
What can you do today to humbly serve the one you love
Maybe it's as simple as leaving brussels sprouts off the dinner menu or as difficult as helping him or her through a long illness
Whatever it is, placing our spouse's needs before our own confirms our commitment to each other through Christlike humility.
Some years ago I came across a short essay written by Sir James Barrie, an English baron
In it he gives an intimate picture of his mother, who deeply loved God and His Word and who literally read her Bible to pieces
'It is mine now,'
Sir James wrote, 'and to me the black threads with which she stitched it are a part of the contents.'
My mother also loved God's Word
She read and pondered it for 60 years or more
I keep her Bible on my bookshelf in a prominent place
It too is tattered and torn, each stained page marked with her comments and reflections
As a boy, I often walked into her room in the morning and found her cradling her Bible in her lap, poring over its words
She did so until the day she could no longer see the words on the page
Even then her Bible was the most precious book in her possession
When Sir James' mother grew old, she could no longer read the words of her Bible
Yet daily, her husband put her Bible in her hands, and she would reverently hold it there
The psalmist wrote, 'How sweet are Your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth'
Have you tasted the goodness of the Lord
Open your Bible today
A TV program on the History Channel featured the world's most extreme airports
The one that caught my attention is no longer open, but it is one I had flown into
I agree that Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport was definitely a thrill ride for passengers and surely a challenge for pilots
If you came in from one direction, you had to fly over skyscrapers and then hope the plane stopped before it plunged into the sea
If you came in the other way, it seemed as if you were going to smack into a mountain
I found it surprising that a pilot who used to take planeloads of people into Kai Tak said, 'I miss flying into that airport.'
But I think I know what he meant
As a pilot, he relished the challenge
He had a confidence based on his ability and his reliance on those who guided him into the airport
Too often, we run from challenges
Yet the people we love to read about in the Bible are impressive because they battled challenges
Consider Paul
With the confidence of God's help, he faced troubles head-on, and conquered them
Christ's promise to Paul and to us is: 'My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness'
Like Paul's example, in the confidence of God's care we can say to the next challenge: Bring it on!
In the episodes of an old television show, the veteran police lieutenant always said this to the young officers on their way out to the street for their day's assignments: 'Be careful out there!'
It was both good advice and a word of compassion because he knew what could happen to them in the line of duty
Jesus gave His followers a similar warning, but in even stronger terms
Luke 11 ends ominously with these words: 'The scribes and the Pharisees began to assail Him vehemently, and to cross-examine Him about many things'
In the continuation of this account, Luke says that Jesus compassionately instructed His disciples to 'beware'
but not to worry or be afraid
Jesus was promising to guard, protect, and care for them as they went out into the world
He assured them that because He cared for simple things like birds and lilies, they could be certain that He would take care of His 'little flock' of believers
We cannot know the future
But we can know this: No matter what comes, we are under the loving, caring, watchful eye of our great Shepherd, who also happens to be the Son of God!
Some years ago when our children were still small, I flew home after a 10-day ministry trip
In those days people were allowed to visit the airport boarding area to greet incoming passengers
When my flight landed, I came out of the jet-bridge and was greeted by our little ones, so happy to see me that they were screaming and crying
I looked at my wife, whose eyes were teary
I couldn't speak
Strangers in the gate area also teared up as our children hugged my legs and cried their greetings
It was a wonderful moment
The memory of the intensity of that greeting serves as a gentle rebuke to the priorities of my own heart
The apostle John, eagerly desiring Jesus' return, wrote, 'He who testifies to these things says, '\sSurely I am coming quickly.' Amen, even so, come, Lord Jesus!'
In another passage, Paul even spoke of a crown awaiting those who have 'loved His appearing'
Yet sometimes I don't feel as eager for Christ's return as my children were for mine
Jesus is worthy of the very best of our love and devotion, and nothing on earth should compare to the thought of seeing Him face-to-face
May our love for our Savior deepen as we anticipate our joyful reunion with Him.
A 47-year-old Austrian man gave away his entire $4.7 million fortune after concluding that his wealth and lavish spending were keeping him from real life and happiness
Karl Rabeder told the Daily Telegraph , 'I had the feeling I was working as a slave for things I did not wish for or need
It was the biggest shock in my life when I realized how horrible, soulless, and without feeling the '\sfive-star' lifestyle is.'
His money now funds charities he set up to help people in Latin America
Proverbs 4 urges us to consider carefully our own road in life
The passage contrasts the free, unhindered path of the just with the dark, confused way of the wicked
'Let your heart retain my words; keep my commands, and live'
'Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of life'
'Ponder the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established'
Each verse encourages us to evaluate where we are in life
No one wants to go through life on a selfish, heartless road
But it can happen unless we consider where we are going in life and ask the Lord for His direction
May He give us grace today to embrace His Word and follow Him with all our hearts.
in the New Testament, did he call them saints because they were perfect
No
These people were human and therefore sinful
What then did he have in mind
The word saint in the New Testament means that one is set apart for God
It describes people who have a spiritual union with Christ
The word is synonymous with individual believers in Jesus and those who make up the church
Saints have a responsibility through the power of the Spirit to live lives worthy of their calling
This includes, but is not limited to, no longer being sexually immoral and using improper speech
We are to put on the new character traits of service to one another, humility, gentleness, patience, love, unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, obedience, and perseverance during hardship and suffering
In the Old Testament, the psalmist called saints 'the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight'
Our union with Christ makes us saints, but our obedience to God's Word through the power of the Holy Spirit makes us saintly.
Fault-finding is a popular pastime, and unfortunately a lot of us find it's easy to join the fun
Concentrating on the warts of others is a great way to feel better about ourselves
And that's just the problem
Avoiding the faults that need to be fixed in our own lives not only stunts our spiritual growth but also obstructs God's work through us
God's effectiveness through our lives is enhanced or hindered by the way we live
It's no wonder, then, that Paul made a concerted effort to 'put no obstacle in anyone's way'
For him there was nothing more important than his usefulness for Christ in the lives of others
Anything that got in the way of that was dispensable
If you want to be authentic and useful for God, take an obstacle inventory
Sometimes obstacles are things that in and of themselves may be legitimate, yet in certain contexts may be inappropriate 
But sin is clearly obstructive to others
Gossip, slander, boasting, bitterness, greed, abuse, anger, selfishness, and revenge all close the hearts of those around us to the message of God through us
So, replace your faults with the winsome ways of Jesus
That will enable others to see your 'no-fault'
Savior more clearly.
Steven Wiltshire, who has been called 'the human camera,' has the amazing ability to recall tiny details about anything he has seen and then reproduce them in drawings
For example, after Steven was flown over the city of Rome, he was asked to draw the city center on blank paper
Astonishingly, he accurately reproduced from memory the winding streets, the buildings, the windows, and other details
Wiltshire's memory is remarkable
Yet there's another kind of memory that's even more amazing, and much more vital
Before Jesus' return to heaven, He promised His disciples that He would send the Holy Spirit to give them supernatural memory of what they had experienced: 'The Helper, the Holy Spirit
will bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you'
The disciples heard Christ's marvelous teachings
They heard Him command the blind to see, the deaf to hear, and the dead to be raised
Yet when the Gospel writers recorded these events, their words were not the product of a gifted human memory
Their recollections came from a divine Helper who made sure they compiled a trustworthy record of Christ's life
Trust the Bible with confidence
It was written with guidance from the 'divine camera,' the Holy Spirit.
After a global financial crisis, the US government enacted stricter laws to protect people from questionable banking practices
Banks had to change some of their policies to comply
To notify me of such changes, my bank sent me a letter
But when I got to the end I had more questions than answers
The use of phrases like 'we may'
and 'at our discretion'
certainly didn't sound like anything I could depend on
In contrast, the Old Testament quotes God as saying 'I will' numerous times
God promises David: 'I will set up your seed after you, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom
He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever'
No uncertainty in those words
Recognizing God's faithfulness to His promises, King Solomon says in his prayer of dedication for the temple: 'You have kept what You promised Your servant David my father; You have both spoken with Your mouth and fulfilled it with Your hand'
Centuries later, the apostle Paul said that all of God's promises are 'yes'
in Christ
In a world of uncertainty, our trust is in a faithful God who will always keep His promises.
Do you have someone you could call in the middle of the night if you needed help
Bible teacher Ray Pritchard calls these people '2 a.m friends.'
If you have an emergency, this kind of friend would ask you two questions: 'Where are you?'
and 'What do you need?'
Friends like that are crucial during difficult times
Jonathan was that type of friend for David
Jonathan's father, King Saul, who was filled with envy at David's popularity and God's blessing on him, tried to kill him
David escaped and asked his friend for help
While David hid in the field, Jonathan sat at dinner with his father and quickly realized that Saul did indeed intend to kill David
Because of their deep friendship, Jonathan 'was grieved for David'
He warned him of his father's plan and told him he should leave
David recognized what a good friend he had in Jonathan
The Bible says they wept together, 'but David more so'
Their souls were 'knit' together
Do you have loving Christian friends you can count on in a crisis
You give them something to eat'
It's easy to miss those words from Jesus
A huge crowd had gathered to hear Him
Late in the day, the disciples got nervous and started pressing Him to send them away 'You give them something to eat!'
Jesus replied
Why would He say that
John 6:6 says He was testing them
Did He want to see if they would trust Him to perform a miracle
Maybe, but it seems more likely He wanted His disciples involved in caring for the crowd, to be hands-on in working with and for Him
He then blessed what they brought to Him, five loaves of bread and two fish, and performed the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000
I think Jesus uses those words with us too
A need pre-sents itself in the lives of those around us, and we bring it to Jesus in prayer 'You do something,'
Jesus often says, 'But, Lord, we don't have enough time or money or energy.'
We're wrong, of course
When Jesus asks us to get involved, He already knows how He will accomplish His work through us
What we need is faith and vision, the ability to see that God wants us to be His instruments, and that He will supply what we need.
Near one of the most majestic sites in God's nature is a botanical garden of awe-inspiring beauty
On the Canadian side of Niagara Falls is the Floral Showhouse
Inside the greenhouse is a vast array of beautiful flowers and exotic plants
In addition to the flora my wife and I observed, something else caught our attention, the wording of a plaque
It reads: 'Enter, friends, and view God's pleasant handiwork, the embroidery of earth.'
What a marvelous way to describe the way our Creator favored this globe with such jaw-dropping beauty
The 'embroidery of earth'
includes such far-ranging God-touches as the verdant rainforests of Brazil, the frigid beauty of Arctic Circle glaciers, the flowing wheat fields of the North American plains, and the sweeping reaches of the fertile Serengeti in Africa
These areas, like those described in Isaiah 41, remind us to praise God for His creative handiwork
Scripture also reminds us that the wonder of individual plants are part of God's work
From the rose to the lily to the myrtle, cypress, and pine , God colors our world with a splendorous display of beauty
Enjoy the wonder
And spend some time praising God for the 'embroidery of earth.'?
A friend sent me photographs of 20 beautiful churches in the world
Located as far apart as Iceland and India, each of them is architecturally unique
The most beautiful place of worship in Jeremiah's day was the temple in Jerusalem, which King Josiah had recently repaired and restored
The people were fixated on the magnificent building , and they foolishly thought that having the temple there meant that God would protect them from their enemies
Instead, Jeremiah pointed out the sin in their lives
God is not impressed by beautiful buildings constructed in His name if there is no inward beauty in the hearts of those who go there
He is not interested in an outward legalistic worship that is not matched by inward holiness
And it is wrong to think that God protects people just because of the religious things they do
Just because we're reading the Bible, praying, and fellowshiping with other believers doesn't mean that God is somehow then obligated to do something for us
He cannot be manipulated
The purpose of those external activities is to develop our relationship with the Lord and to help us live differently than those in the world around us.
When my wife and I were engaged, her dad gave us a special wedding present
As a watchmaker and jeweler, he made our wedding rings
To make my wedding band, Jim used gold scraps left over from resizing other rings, scraps that were seemingly without much value
But in the hands of this craftsman, those pieces became a thing of beauty that I cherish to this day
It is amazing what a master craftsman can do with what others might view as useless
That is also how God works in our lives
He is the greatest Master Craftsman of all, taking the wasted pieces and broken shards of our lives and restoring them to worth and meaning
The prophet Jeremiah described this when he compared God's work to that of a potter working clay: 'The vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter; so he made it again into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make'
No matter what messes we have made of our lives, God can remold us into vessels that are good in His eyes
As we confess any sin and submit ourselves in obedience to His Word, we allow the Master to do His redemptive work in our lives
That is the only way for the pieces of our brokenness to be made whole and good once again.
A 60-year-old hotel in Kansas is being renovated into apartments
A rusty ship that is docked in Philadelphia is being restored and may become a hotel or a museum
Hangar 61, an admired piece of architecture at the old Stapleton Airport in Colorado, is being transformed into a church
Each structure had a specific use that is no longer viable
Yet someone was able to see promise and a new purpose in each one
If structures can find new life and purpose, why not people
Think about these men in the Bible whose lives took an unexpected direction
There was Jacob, who wrestled with the angel of the Lord ; Moses, who talked to a burning bush ; Paul, who was temporarily blinded
Their stories were different, but all had a change of purpose when their encounter with God sent them down a new path
We too may experience circumstances that change the course of our lives
But God reminds us of this: I loved you before you loved Me
I want to give you hope and a future
Give all your worries to Me because I care about you
As you cling to God's promises, ask Him to reveal new direction and purpose for your life.
Things were off to a great start for Jesus at the beginning of His ministry
In Matthew 3, He was baptized and heard the affirming words of His Father, 'This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased'
But then things took a turn for the worse
What happened next, Jesus' temptation in the wilderness, was not a mere coincidence
The Holy Spirit led Him into this face-off between the powers of heaven and hell
Thankfully, Jesus' victory in the face of temptation provides a great example when we find ourselves in the wilderness of Satan's sinister seductions
Notice that the tempter caught Jesus at a time when He was tired and hungry
Satan uses the same tactic with us
Waiting for those vulnerable moments, he lures us with the bait of seductive suggestions that offer quick relief and opportunities for self-advancement
When facing such challenges, it's important to follow Jesus' example' throw 'the Book' at Satan
Jesus responded to temptation by quoting Scripture: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God'
The Bible is full of verses about lust, greed, lying, and other sins
If we tuck them away in our memory, we can use them when under attack
It's our best chance for success!
My friend Jeff was asked by his daughter to officiate at her wedding
This would be a great joy as they traveled to an exotic and romantic location for the ceremony
But there was one major problem, because the wedding party was very small, Jeff would have to perform three separate roles that could be in conflict
He would be the officiating minister, the father of the bride, and the wedding photographer
Have you ever felt as if you were wearing too many hats
Jethro thought his son-in-law Moses was
Leading the Israelites, arbitrating personal disputes, and handing down legal judgments for a great multitude was taking its toll
Finally, Jethro approached Moses, telling him: 'This thing is too much for you; you are not able to perform it by yourself'
He wisely counseled Moses to delegate smaller disputes to other advisors and take the more challenging cases himself
Whether you're a mother with small children, an overwhelmed business executive, or an overworked church volunteer, you too can take a lesson from Moses
Why not prayerfully discern if there may be tasks you can delegate to others or even discontinue, so that you don't wear yourself out.
During a demonstration of sheep- herding using a Border Collie, the dog trainer explained that because sheep are highly vulnerable to wild animals, their main defense against predators is to stay together in a tightly knit group
'A sheep alone is a dead sheep,'
the trainer said
'The dog always keeps the sheep together as it moves them.'
The biblical image of God as our shepherd is a powerful reminder of how much we need each other in the community of faith
When writing about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, the psalmist said, '[God] made His own people go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock; and He led them on safely, so that they did not fear'
As part of God's flock, we who have trusted Christ are under His guiding, protecting hand while being surrounded by the shielding presence of others
We are part of a larger body of believers in which there is safety and accountability
While we don't give up our personal responsibility for thought and action as members of the flock, we are to embrace the concept of 'we'
rather than 'me'
in our daily lives
With Christ as our Shepherd and fellow believers around us, we find safety in the flock.
I have a good friend I fish with now and then
He's a very thoughtful man
After climbing into his waders and boots and gathering up his gear, he sits on the tailgate of his truck and scans the river for 15 minutes or more, looking for rising fish
'No use fishing where they ain't,' he says
This makes me think of another question: 'Do I fish for souls where they ain't?'
It was said of Jesus that He was 'a friend of tax collectors and sinners'
As Christians, we are to be unlike the world in our behavior, but squarely in it as He was
So we have to ask ourselves: Do I, like Jesus, have friends who are sinners
If I have only Christian friends, I may be fishing for souls 'where they ain't.'
Being with nonbelievers is the first step in 'fishing.'
Then comes love, a heart-kindness that sees beneath the surface of their off-hand remarks and listens for the deeper cry of the soul
It asks, 'Can you tell me more about that?'
pastor George Herbert said, 'There is much preaching in this friendliness,'
Such love is not a natural instinct, it comes solely from God
And so we pray: 'Lord, when I am with nonbelievers today, may I become aware of the cheerless voice, the weary countenance, or the downcast eyes that I, in my natural self-preoccupation, could easily overlook
May I have a love that springs from and is rooted in Your love
May I listen to others, show Your compassion, and speak Your truth today.'?
I discovered rather quickly that a young boy quoting Scripture in a children's program at church didn't know much about the Bible
He was quoting Ephesians 6:17 from our study on spiritual armor: 'Take
the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.'
When he tried quoting the reference, he said, 'I didn't think I needed to memorize the numbers, since that's just the time of day.'
That's what he thought the numbers meant since it was close to 6:17 p.m at the time
I smiled, opened my Bible, and showed him that the numbers refer to the chapter and verse
While knowing the Bible reference is helpful, hiding God's Word in our hearts is what is truly important
Memorizing Scripture allows us to have it in mind so we can ward off Satan's attacks
For instance, when the devil tempted Jesus in the wilderness, Christ withstood him by quoting the Scriptures
Likewise, when we are tempted to disobey God, we can recall what we've learned and choose to obey
We can also share the teachings of the Word with others to encourage them to trust Him too
No matter what time of day it is, we should always take the spiritual armor of the Word of God with us.
Toni was looking for what wasn't really lost, and she found what she wasn't looking for
As a result, a group of people got a spiritual boost they weren't expecting
Toni, who conducts a Bible study in a drug and alcohol rehabilitation clinic in Alaska, was looking for her husband's missing driver's license
As she retraced his steps from the previous day, she visited a hospital
The missing license wasn't there, but a Christian high school chorale was, and Toni was touched by their worshipful singing
She asked the director if the teens could sing for her Bible-study group that evening
They could, and they did, bringing hope, joy, and God's love through music and post-concert conversation to some folks trying to put their lives back together
Oh, and that driver's license
Toni found it on a chair when she got back home
Apparently, the only reason she went out that day was so God could direct her to hear a bunch of teens who could minister to her rehab group
When God guides us , He works in ways we can't predict
He can use even our inconveniences to bring honor to His name
When we face a seeming nuisance in our day, perhaps we should look not just for what we think we want but also for what God has for us that day.
When our youngest son joined the Army, we knew that challenges lay ahead
We knew that he would face danger and be tested physically, emotionally, and spiritually
We also knew that in some ways our home would never fully be his home again
In the months leading up to his departure, my wife and I steeled ourselves for these challenges
Then the day came when Mark had to report
We hugged and said our goodbyes, and then he walked into the recruiting station, leaving me with a moment for which I was decidedly unprepared
The pain of that hard goodbye felt unbearable
At the risk of sounding overly dramatic, I can't remember when I have wept as hard as I did that day
The hard goodbye, and the sense of loss it delivered, cut me to the heart
In such moments, I am thankful to have a heavenly Father who knows what it is to be separated from a beloved Son
I am thankful to have a God who is described as 'a father of the fatherless, a defender of widows'
I believe that if He cares for the orphaned and the widows in their loneliness, He will also care for me and comfort me, even in those moments when I face the struggles that accompany hard goodbyes.
Jerry McMorris began reading the Wall Street Journal 50 years ago as a student at the University of Colorado
His appreciation for that publication and for his alma mater led him to donate hundreds of WSJ subscriptions for CU's business school students
McMorris told the Colorado Springs Gazette: 'The Journal gave me a good, broad perspective of what was going on in the business world, and I got into the habit of reading it at the start of my business day
It helps get across to students real business-world issues.'
Many people enjoy introducing others to the writings that have shaped their lives
It's not surprising, then, that followers of Christ enjoy sharing God's Word with others
Some support Bible translation and distribution while others invite friends to study the Word with them
There are many ways to pass along God's truth to people hungering for encouragement and help
Our goal is to enable others to experience the great benefit we've found in knowing Christ and being guided by His Word
The psalmist said, 'The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple'
The Word of God, which guards our hearts and guides our steps, is worth sharing with others.
Sometimes I am ashamed of my prayers
Too often I hear myself using familiar phrases that are more like mindless filler than thoughtful, intimate interaction
One phrase that annoys me, and that I think might offend God, is 'Lord, be with me.'
In Scripture, God has already promised not to leave me
God made this promise to Joshua just before he led the Israelites into the Promised Land
The author of Hebrews later claimed it for all believers: 'I will never leave you nor forsake you'
In both cases, the context indicates that God's presence has to do with giving us the power to carry out His will, not our own will, which is generally what I have in mind in my prayers
Perhaps a better prayer would be something like this: 'Lord, thank You for Your indwelling Spirit who is willing and able to direct me in the ways You want me to go
May I not take You where You don't want to go
May I not enlist You to do my will, but humbly submit to doing Yours.'
When we are doing God's will, He will be with us even without our asking
If we're not doing His will, we need to ask for His forgiveness, change our course, and follow Him.
A few years ago I had some tests to screen for cancer, and I was nervous about the outcome
My anxiety was magnified as I thought about the fact that while the medical personnel were well-trained and extremely competent, they were also strangers who had no relationship with me
After awakening from the anesthesia, however, I heard the beautiful sound of my wife's voice: 'It's great, Honey
They didn't find anything.'
I looked up at her smiling face and was comforted
I needed the assurance of someone who loved me
A similar assurance lies ahead for all who have trusted Jesus
Believers can be comforted in knowing that when they wake up in heaven, One who loves them greatly, Jesus, will be there
The Book of Common Prayer expresses this Christian hope: 'After my awakening, [my Redeemer] will raise me up; and in my body I shall see God
I myself shall see, and eyes behold Him who is my friend and not a stranger.'
Do you have trouble facing mortality
Jesus promised to be there when we slip from this world into the next
He said, 'Where I am [heaven], there you may be also'
What a comfort for believers to know that after death we will be awakened by a close Friend.
Someone once said, 'The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow
Do good anyway.'
I like that; it's a great reminder
In the book of Acts, Luke summarized Jesus' earthly ministry by saying that He 'went about doing good'
What does the Bible mean when it tells us to 'do good'?
Jesus did good by teaching, healing, feeding, and comforting people
Using Jesus as the perfect example, His followers are called to meet the needs of others, including those who hate them: 'Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you'
They are to serve their enemies without expecting anything in return
Moreover, as opportunity arises, His followers are to do good especially to fellow believers
They are not to let persecution, selfishness, and busyness cause them to forget to do good and to share what they have with others
To be like our Savior and His early followers, we should ask ourselves each day: 'What good thing can I do today in Jesus' name?'
When we do good, we will be offering a sacrifice that pleases God and that draws people to Him .
In an effort to assist people struggling to provide for their families during tough economic times, the church I attend created a program called 'Free 4 All.'
We brought lightly used items to the church and opened the doors to people of the community
They could come and take home anything they needed
While the day was a huge success as far as the amount of goods people were able to pick up, it was even better for this reason: Six people trusted Jesus Christ as Savior at the event
The items that were taken to the church on this special day had already been purchased
They were then given without cost to all who simply asked for them
Likewise, eternal forgiveness for our sins has already been purchased
Jesus paid that price when He died on a cross on Golgotha's hill 2,000 years ago
He now offers salvation at no cost to all who simply repent and believe that Jesus has the power to forgive and save
Each of us is needy spiritually, and only Jesus can meet that need
One day I bought an inexpensive model of the solar system for my son
Installing it required me to suspend each planet from the ceiling
After bending up and down several times, I was lightheaded and tired
Hours later, we heard a 'plink' as Jupiter hit the floor
Later that night, I thought about how our flimsy replica fell apart, yet Jesus sustains the actual universe
'He is before all things, and in Him all things consist'
The Lord Jesus holds our world together, maintaining the natural laws that rule the galaxy
Our Creator also upholds 'all things by the word of His power'
Jesus is so mighty that He keeps the universe in order simply by commanding it to be so
As amazing as this is, Jesus is more than a cosmic caretaker
He sustains us too
He 'gives life and breath to everything, and He satisfies every need'
While Jesus sometimes provides for us differently than we might expect, our Savior keeps us going whether we are brokenhearted, in need of money, or enduring illness
Until the day He calls us home, we can trust that the One who keeps Jupiter from falling is the One who holds us up as well.
Philosophers ponder, 'What is the good life and who has it?'
I instantly think of my good friend Roy
Roy was a gentle, quiet man who sought no recognition, who left the care of his life to his heavenly Father, and who occupied himself solely with his Father's will
His was a heavenly perspective as he often reminded me: 'We are but sojourners here.'
Roy passed away last fall
At his memorial service, friends reminisced over his influence on their lives
Many spoke of his kindness, selfless giving, humility, and gentle compassion
He was, for many, a visible expression of God's unconditional love
After the service, Roy's son drove to the assisted-living facility where his father lived out his final days
He gathered up his dad's belongings: two pairs of shoes, a few shirts and pants, and a few odds and ends, the sum of Roy's earthly goods, and delivered them to a local charity
Roy never had what some would consider the good life, but he was rich toward God in good deeds
George MacDonald wrote, 'Which one is the possessor of heaven and earth: He who has a thousand houses, or he who, with no house to call his own, has ten at which his knock arouses instant jubilation?'
Roy's was the good life after all.
A couple of years ago in our church we did a sermon series on the Old Testament tabernacle
Leading up to the message on the table of showbread, I did something I had never done before, I fasted from food for several days
I fasted because I wanted to experience the truth that 'man shall not live by bread alone; but man lives by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord'
I wanted to deny myself something I love, food, for the God I love more
As I fasted, I followed Jesus' teaching about fasting in Matthew 6:16-18
Jesus gave a negative command: 'When you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with a sad countenance'
Then He gave a positive command about putting oil on your head and washing your face
The two commands taken together meant that they should not draw attention to themselves
Jesus was teaching that this was a private act of sacrificial worship that should not provide any room for religious pride
Finally, He gave a promise: Your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you
Although fasting isn't required, in giving up something we love, we may have a deeper experience of the God we love
He rewards us with Himself.
While traveling in a foreign country, my husband noticed that the paved roads had deep indentations
When he asked about them, our driver explained that they were caused by the tires of trucks carrying illegal, overweight loads
When stopped by police, the drivers paid bribes to avoid being fined
The truckers and police officers came out ahead financially, but other drivers and taxpayers were left with an unfair financial burden and the inconvenience of poor roads
Not all bribery is overt; some is more subtle
And not all bribes are financial
Flattery is a type of bribe that uses words as currency
If we give people preferential treatment for saying something nice about us, it's similar to taking a bribe
To God, any kind of partiality is an injustice
He even made justice a condition of remaining in the Promised Land
The Israelites were not to pervert justice or show partiality
Bribery deprives others of justice, which is an offense against the character of God, who is 'God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality nor takes a bribe'
Thankfully, the Lord treats all of us alike, and He wants us to treat each other the same way.
Angie could not see through the fogged-up windows in her car
Inadvertently, she pulled out in front of a truck
The accident caused such damage to her brain that she could no longer speak or take care of herself
Over the years, I have been amazed at the resiliency of Angie's parents
Recently I asked them, 'How have you managed to get through this experience?'
Her father thoughtfully responded, 'In all honesty, the only way we have been able to do this is by drawing close to God
He gives us the strength we need to help us through.'
Angie's mother agreed and added that around the time of the accident their grieving was so deep that they wondered if they would ever have joy again
As they both leaned upon God, they experienced countless unexpected provisions for the physical and spiritual care of Angie and their entire family
Although Angie may never regain her ability to speak, she now responds to them with wide smiles and this gives them joy
Her parents' favorite verse continues to be: 'Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning'
Have you experienced extreme sorrow
There is the promise of future joy amid your tears as you lean upon our loving Lord.
I always look forward to summer
The warm sunshine, baseball, beaches, and barbecues are pleasures that bring joy after a long, cold winter
But pleasure-seeking isn't just seasonal
Don't we all enjoy good food, engaging conversation, and a crackling fire
The desire for pleasure isn't wrong
God has built us for it
Paul reminds us that God 'gives us richly all things to enjoy'
Other passages welcome us to the healthy pleasure of food, friends, and the intimacy of a marriage relationship
But thinking that we can find lasting pleasure in people and things is ultimately an empty pursuit
Ultimate pleasure is not found in the short-lived thrills our world offers, but rather in the long-term joy from a deepening intimacy with our Lord
King Solomon learned this the hard way
'I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure,'
he admitted
But after his pleasure-seeking spree, he concluded: 'All was vanity and grasping for the wind'
It's no wonder he warned, 'He who loves pleasure will be a poor man'
What we are really looking for is satisfied only in a fulfilling and growing relationship with Jesus
Pursue Him and taste His delights!
My friend and I were traveling together, and she seemed a bit frazzled
When we got to the airport, she forgot to have her identification readily available and couldn't find her reservation confirmation number
The ticket agent waited patiently, smiled, and then helped her at the check-in
After receiving her ticket, she asked, 'Where do we go next?'
The agent smiled again, pointed at me, and said to her, 'Stay close to your friend.'
That can be good advice for all of us when our lives get frazzled, stay close to your friends
Although Jesus is our best friend, we also need relationships with fellow believers to help us survive in this life
In his first epistle, Peter was writing to believers who needed one another because they were suffering for their faith
In a few short sentences in chapter 4, Peter mentioned the need to receive and give 'fervent love,'
prayer, and hospitality
He also included the need for believers to use their spiritual gifts to minister to one another
In other passages, we're encouraged to comfort each other with the comfort we've been given by God and to build each other up in love
When life gets difficult and we get frazzled, staying close to our Christian friends will help us to get through.
From my home in Colorado, I recently used Google Maps to 'wander around'
the neighborhood in Nairobi, Kenya, where my family lived 2 decades ago
A satellite image on my computer screen enabled me to identify roads, landmarks, and buildings
In some cases, I got a street-level view, as if I were standing on the ground there
It was quite a view, but only a small taste of how the Lord must see our world
The psalmist celebrated God's view by writing these words: 'The Lord looks from heaven; He sees all the sons of men
He considers all their works
The eye of the Lord is on those who fear Him, on those who hope in His mercy, to deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine'
Unlike an unfeeling satellite, the Lord sees with His heart of love as He considers who we are and what we do
The Bible reveals that He longs for us to trust Him and follow His way
We are never out of God's sight, and He keeps a close eye on everyone whose hope is in Him
For all who know the Lord through faith in Jesus Christ, it's encouraging to realize that every day we're part of His amazing view.
I took the bait
At first, we traded one-liners aimed at goading the other or scoring points
Gradually, though, bits and pieces of our respective life stories started creeping into the discussion
Curiosity got the better of both of us and we found ourselves asking questions instead of feuding
A political science major in college and a political junkie by hobby, I was intrigued with his career, which included two prominent ambassadorships
Strangely enough, his questions to me were about my faith
How I became 'a believer'
was what interested him most
The train ride ended amicably, and we even traded business cards
As he left the train, he turned to me and said, 'By the way, the best part of your argument isn't what you think Jesus can do for me
It's what He's done for you.'
In John 9, as on that train, God reminds us that the best story is the one we know intimately: Our own encounter with Jesus Christ
Practice telling your story of faith to loved ones and close friends so you'll be able to tell it clearly to others.
For a good portion of my life, I shared the perspective of those who rail against God for allowing pain
I could find no way to rationalize a world as toxic as this one
As I visited people whose pain far exceeded my own, though, I was surprised by its effects
Suffering seemed as likely to reinforce faith as to sow doubt
My anger about pain has melted mostly for one reason: I have come to know God
He has given me joy and love and happiness and goodness
It leaves me with faith in a Person, a faith so solid that no amount of suffering can erode it
Where is God when it hurts
He has been there from the beginning
He designed a pain system that, in the midst of a fallen world, bears His stamp
He transforms pain, using it to teach and strengthen us if we allow it to turn us toward Him
He has hurt and bled and cried and suffered
He has dignified for all time those who suffer, by sharing their pain
But one day He will gather the armies of heaven and will unleash them against the enemies of God
The world will see one last terrifying moment of suffering before the full victory is ushered in
Then God will create for us a new, incredible world and pain will be no more .
England's Imperial War Museum is housed in a building in London that was a former location of the Bethlem Royal Hospital, a care center for the mentally ill
The hospital was commonly known as 'Bedlam,'
which gradually became a term used to describe scenes of chaos and madness
It's ironic that the War Museum would occupy Bedlam's former location
As you walk through the museum, in addition to stories of heroism and sacrifice in wartime, you also find bone-chilling accounts of the madness of man's inhumanity to man
From the exhibits about modern genocide and ethnic cleansing to the one on the Holocaust, it is evil on display
Solomon observed mankind's propensity for evil, describing it as those who 'rejoice in doing evil, and delight in the perversity of the wicked'
While this may describe much of the world around us, followers of Jesus have a refreshingly different way to handle life
Paul challenged us: 'Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good'
Christ-centered actions such as living morally , making peace , and treating our enemies with care will affect the world for good
If each of us were to live as a reflection of God's love, perhaps there would be a lot less bedlam.
If you're a fan of Shakespeare, you know that his heroes always have a serious character flaw
It makes for a good story and teaches some important lessons
The same is true of our Bible hero Abraham
His flaw
Fear
Twice Abraham succumbed to his fear that a ruler would kill him and steal his wife
Fearing for his life, he deceived both Pharaoh and King Abimelech by saying, 'She is my sister'?, in essence welcoming the king to take Sarah into his harem
With fear dictating his actions, he put at risk God's plan that through him and Sarah a great nation would arise
But before we judge Abraham, we should ask ourselves a few questions
For fear of losing our job, would we compromise our integrity
For fear of appearing old-fashioned, would we set aside our values
For fear of being ridiculed or misunderstood, would we neglect sharing the gospel and put someone's eternity at risk
Only one thing will conquer our fears: tenacious faith in God's presence, protection, power, and promises
If your fear is putting God's wonderful plans for you at risk, remember that He will never ask you to do anything He can't bring to completion, even if it requires miraculous intervention on His part.
The psalmist was fed up with 'the contempt of the proud'
Perhaps you are too
People in your neighborhood, office, or classroom may be scornful of your faith and determination to follow Jesus
Sticks and stones do break our bones, but words can wound more deeply
In his commentary on this psalm, Derek Kidner refers to contempt as 'cold steel.'
We can fend off the jeers of the proud by becoming like them, or we can view their attempt to humiliate us as a badge of honor
We can rejoice that we've been 'counted worthy to suffer shame for Jesus name'
Better to bear shame for a short time than to endure 'everlasting contempt'
We must not be like the mockers by mocking them in turn, but bless those who persecute us
'Bless and do not curse,'
Paul reminds us
Then God may draw them to faith and repentance, and turn our moments of shame into eternal glory
Finally, as the psalmist counsels us, we must 'look to the Lord our God'
He understands as no other, for He too has endured reproach
He will show compassion to us according to His infinite mercy.
Too long
Too short
Too big
Too small
Too tight
Too loose
These words describe most of the clothes I try on
Finding the perfect fit seems impossible
Finding a church that is a 'perfect fit'
poses similar problems
Every church has something that's not quite right
Certain attitudes, beliefs, people, or programs make us uncomfortable
We feel as if we don't fit
We struggle to find our place
We know, however, that God wants us to fit together with one another
The apostle Paul said we are being 'built together to become a dwelling in which God lives'
The believers in the church today, like the tabernacle in the days of Moses and the temple in the days of Solomon , are the dwelling place of God on earth
God wants us to fit together, for there to be no divisions in His church
This means that we, the building blocks, are to be 'perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment'
No church will be a perfect fit, but we can all work at fitting together more perfectly.
What a rotten design,'
I grumbled, as I emptied our paper shredder
I was following good advice about shredding personal documents, but I could not empty the container without spilling strips of confetti all over the carpet
One day as I was gathering trash, I debated whether I'd even bother since it was only half-full
But when I slipped a small plastic bag over the top and flipped it upside down, I was pleased to see that not a bit of paper had fallen on the floor
The error had been mine
I had been waiting until the container was filled to the brim before emptying it
When we allow sin to fill up our hearts, it too will overflow into our life
Luke 6:45 says that 'an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth evil.'
What if we were to empty our hearts of the rubbish of sin before it started spilling into our interactions with others
To dispose of our bitterness, stubborn pride, seething anger
First John 1:9 reminds us that 'if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.'
A paper shredder is designed to be a rubbish receptacle
You and I are not!
If a player's ball goes out-of-bounds, a one-stroke penalty is imposed
The prophet Jeremiah warned the southern kingdom of Judah about their persistent rejection of God's boundaries for them
Yet, the Lord's people had defiant and rebellious hearts
There was no fear of God, who gave them rain for their crops
They grew rich on deceit and ignored the pleas of the disadvantaged
God has given moral boundaries in His Word for us to live within
He gave them not to frustrate us but so that by keeping within them we may enjoy His blessings
David wrote: 'I know, O Lord, that Your judgments are right'
God told Israel through Moses, 'I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life'
On February 1, 1960, four students from an all-black college sat down at a 'whites only' lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina
One of them, Franklin McCain, noticed an older white woman seated nearby looking at them
He was sure that her thoughts were unkind toward them and their protest against segregation
A few minutes later she walked over to them, put her hands on their shoulders, and said, 'Boys, I am so proud of you.'
Recalling the event years later on National Public Radio, McCain said he learned from this never to stereotype anyone
Instead he should pause to consider others and seek an opportunity to talk with them
The first-century church, like ours today, was often fractured by divisions based on race, language, and culture
Paul wrote to the followers of Jesus in Corinth to help them respond to those who were more concerned with outward appearance than with what is in the heart
Because Christ died for all, Paul said, 'From now on, we regard no one according to the flesh'
May we all look closely to see the person inside, for everyone is made in the image of God and can become a new creation in Christ.
Celebrating my 60th birthday really changed my perspective on life,  I used to think people in their sixties were 'old.'
Then I started counting the number of productive years I might have left and set the number at 10
I went along with this dead-end kind of thinking until I remembered a very productive co-worker who was 85
So I sought him out to ask what life after 60 was like
He told me of some of the wonderful ministry opportunities the Lord had given him over the last 25 years
The apostle Paul, referring to himself as 'aged'
in Philemon 1:9, really resonates with my own sense of aging: 'Being such a one as Paul, the aged'
I appeal to you for my son Onesimus'
Paul was asking Philemon to take back his runaway servant Onesimus
Some scholars believe Paul was in his late forties or early fifties when he wrote this, certainly not a senior citizen by today's standards
But life expectancy in those days was much shorter
Yet despite awareness of his mature years, Paul went on to serve the Lord for several more years
While we may experience physical or other kinds of limitations, what really matters is that we continue doing what we can for the Lord until He calls us Home.
As we hurtle through the first part of this new century, we see an increase in people questioning time-honored standards
This was plainly detailed recently by a teen pop star, a girl who professes faith in Jesus
While discussing standards for modesty in how she dresses, she discounted criticism of her skimpy clothing by saying, 'That's so old school.'
This young woman is both right and wrong
In a sense, she's right
The standards of dress for Christians are 'old school.'
They were written down more than 2,000 years ago
But her attitude that suggests ancient standards can be set aside is wrong
In the truest sense, the principles in the Bible are not 'old'
While written ages ago, they are still fresh and applicable
As to the question of modesty, when the Bible says women should 'adorn themselves in modest apparel'
it is still true today that we shouldn't dress to draw attention to ourselves
A more general principle, 'Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed'
is a 2011 command that can guide the question of how we dress
So whether you're a pop star or a pew sitter, don't worry about being 'old school' if what you are doing is done according to the Book.
My occupation is words
Whether I am writing or editing, I am using words to convey ideas so that readers can understand
I can usually see what's wrong with someone else's writing and figure out how to fix it
As an editor, I am paid for being critical
My job is to see what's wrong with the way words are used
This ability becomes a disability when I carry it over into my personal life and always look for what is wrong
Focusing on what's wrong can cause us to miss everything that's good
The apostle Paul had reason to focus on what was wrong in the Philippian church
Certain people were preaching the gospel out of selfish ambition to add to Paul's suffering
But instead of concentrating on the negative, he chose to look at the positive and rejoice in it: Jesus Christ was being preached
God wants us to be discerning, we need to know good from bad, but He doesn't want us to focus on the bad and become critical or discouraged
Even in circumstances that are less than ideal , we can find something good because in times of trouble God is still at work.
Inevitably, trouble will invade our lives
A bad report from a medical test, the betrayal of a trusted friend, a child who rejects us, or a spouse who leaves us
The list of possibilities is long, but there are only two options: forge ahead on our own, or turn to God
Flying solo into the face of trouble is not a good idea
It can lead to bad behavior patterns, blaming God, and retreating into defeat
Like the Israelites, we may spin out of control and into despair
When the majority of the spies brought a report of intimidating giants and dangers ahead, they used the pronoun 'we'
The Israelites were on the cusp of the ultimate blessing that God promised to them
They were eyewitnesses to the miracles in Egypt and their feet had walked the dry bottom of the Red Sea in jaw-dropping victory
God's faithfulness had been amazingly evident
What short memories
What disappointing faithlessness
Sadly, they turned their backs on God and left the blessing behind
Caleb and Joshua, on the other hand, opted to turn to the Lord with this confidence: 'The Lord is with us'
When your giants show up, what will you do?
For the past 29 years, the annual Celebration of Life reunion in our city has brought together members of a unique family
The festive gathering reunites doctors, nurses, and staff from Colorado Springs' Memorial Hospital for Children with former patients from its neonatal intensive care unit
Some are infants in strollers while others are young teens
Their parents have come with them to say thank you to those who saved their children's lives and gave them a second chance
Edward Paik's article in The Gazette quoted Dr
Bob Kiley's heartfelt response: 'Both professionally and personally, for all the staff, this solidifies why we're in this job.'
I wonder if in heaven there will be many such times when spiritual caregivers and those they helped as 'babes in Christ'
will reunite to share stories and give praise to God
The New Testament describes how Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy worked among the young believers in Thessalonica with gentleness, 'just as a nursing mother cherishes her own children'
and with comfort and encouragement, 'as a father does his own children'
Helping new believers at a critical stage in their faith is a labor of love that will be cause for great rejoicing at the 'family'
reunion in heaven.
I wear only two pieces of jewelry: a wedding band on my finger and a small Celtic cross on a chain around my neck
The ring represents my vow to be faithful to Carolyn, my wife, as long as I shall live
The cross reminds me that it is not for her sake alone, but for Jesus' sake that I do so
He has asked me to be faithful to her until death shall separate us
A marriage vow is more than a contract that we can break by paying damages
It is a unique vow that is explicitly intended to be binding until death separates us
The words 'for better, for worse; for richer, for poorer; in sickness and in health'
take into consideration the probability that it will not be easy to keep our vows
Circumstances may change and so may our spouses
Marriage is hard at best; disagreements and difficult adjustments abound
While no one must live in an abusive and dangerous relationship, accepting the difficulties of poverty, hardship, and disappointment can lead to happiness
A marriage vow is a binding obligation to love, honor, and cherish one another for as long as we shall live because Jesus has asked us to do so
As a friend of mine once put it, 'This is the vow that keeps us faithful even when we don't feel like keeping our vows.'
Yves Rossy accomplished something people have dreamed of since the ancient myth of Icarus
He has flown
Known as the 'Fusion Man,'
Rossy built a set of wings with an engine pack that uses his body as the fuselage of the aircraft, with the wings fused to the back of his heat-resistant suit
His first flight took place near Geneva, Switzerland, in 2004, and he has since had numerous successful flights
The psalmist David longed to have wings so he could fly away
In a time when he was being pursued by enemies who were seeking to take his life, Israel's king cried, 'Oh, that I had wings like a dove, I would fly away and be at rest'
Like David, when we're facing pressure, mistreatment, hardship, or grief, we might wish we could sprout wings and fly away
But Jesus offers a better way
Rather than fleeing our struggles, He invites us to flee to Him
He said, 'Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest
Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me,
and you will find rest for your souls'
Rather than wishing we could fly away and escape life's problems, we can bring them to Him
Escape cannot give us rest, but Jesus can.
My friend Dan, who was soon to graduate from high school, was required to make a senior presentation
He had 15 minutes to share how he had made it to the point of graduation and to thank those who had helped him along the way
I gazed around the room before he started to talk
All kinds of people, young families, teachers, friends, church leaders, and coaches, were in attendance
He began to talk about the ways each person had touched his life
One woman had 'been like an aunt and had always been there' for him
A 30-something man shared Scriptures often and gave counsel.
Another man had taught him discipline and hard work.
A church friend had taken him to football practice every day because his mom couldn't
A couple had treated him like he was their own son.
One commonality, they were all just ordinary Christians who had reached out to make a difference in his life
Paul called it doing 'good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith'
We can help shape another person's life by showing an interest and taking action
And, as happened with Dan, we can reap a harvest
Look around
Is there someone whose life needs your touch?
Someone has defined friendship as 'knowing the heart of another and sharing one's heart with another.'
We share our hearts with those we trust, and trust those who care about us
We confide in our friends because we have confidence that they will use the information to help us, not harm us
They in turn confide in us for the same reason
We often refer to Jesus as our friend because we know that He wants what is best for us
We confide in Him because we trust Him
But have you ever considered that Jesus confides in His people
Jesus began calling His disciples friends rather than servants because He had entrusted them with everything He had heard from His Father
Jesus trusted the disciples to use the information for the good of His Father's kingdom
Although we know that Jesus is our friend, can we say that we are His friends
Do we listen to Him
Or do we only want Him to listen to us
Do we want to know what's on His heart
Or do we only want to tell Him what's on ours
To be a friend of Jesus, we need to listen to what He wants us to know and then use the information to bring others into friendship with Him.
A case before the US Supreme Court focused on whether a religious symbol, specifically a cross, should be allowed on public land
Mark Sherman, writing for the Associated Press, said that although the cross in question was erected in 1934 as a memorial to soldiers who died in World War I, one veteran's group that opposed it called the cross 'a powerful Christian symbol'
and 'not a symbol of any other religion.'
The cross has always been controversial
In the first century, the apostle Paul said that Christ had sent him 'to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect
For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God'
As followers of Christ, we see the cross as more than a powerful Christian symbol
It is the evidence of God's power to free us from the tyranny of our sin
In a diverse and pluralistic society, the controversy over religious symbols will continue
Whether a cross can be displayed on public property will likely be determined by the courts
But displaying the power of the cross through our lives will be decided in our hearts.
Early in the spring, my wife and I watched a fascinating bird show outside our kitchen window
A couple of blackbirds with straw in their beaks entered a small vent in the house next door
A couple of weeks later, to our delight, we saw four baby birds stick their heads out of the vent
Mom and Dad took turns feeding their hungry babies
Seeing the babies' wide-open mouths reminded me of how important it is for followers of Christ to eagerly desire spiritual food
In 1 Peter 2:2, the apostle Peter uses the analogy of babies longing to be fed: 'As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby.'
The Greek word translated 'desire'
speaks of an intense yearning
It is a compound word meaning to 'earnestly desire'
or to 'long after.'
It might seem strange to be commanded to earnestly long for something
But unlike hungry birds and babies, we need to be reminded of our need for spiritual nourishment
Even though we may have fed on the Word in the past , we need to realize that our need is ongoing and that without more nourishment we will grow spiritually weak
God is eager to feed His dear children
So, open wide!
While staying at our house for a while, my granddaughter Addie began asking, 'Whatcha doin' Grandpa?'
over and over
Whether I was working at my computer, putting on my shoes to go outside, sitting down to read, or helping in the kitchen, she sidled up to me and asked what I was doing
After answering her a few dozen times with, 'Paying bills,'
'Going to the store,'
'Reading the paper,'
'Helping Grandma,'
I came to the conclusion that she was asking a key question
Answering to a curious little girl about everything we do is one thing, but answering to God about our actions is infinitely more important
Wouldn't it be helpful to think of God coming alongside us at any time to ask, 'What are you doing?'
Imagine how often our answers would seem meaningless or empty
'I'm spending the entire evening watching TV.'
'I'm eating more food than I should.'
'I'm going another day without talking to You.'
'I'm arguing with my spouse.'
The list could go on, to our embarrassment
We are told to use our time carefully, with God's glory in sight
Paul said, 'Be very careful, then, how you live'
So, it's a good question
God wants to know: 'Whatcha doin'?'?
We live in an age dominated by all kinds of public opinion polls
Decisions are being driven by the crowd, and some of that is good
Surveys can inform us about people's experiences with products, helping us make wiser purchases
Opinion polls can give government officials a sense of how their policy initiatives will be received
While information gleaned is a matter of personal opinion, it can be helpful in shaping decision-making on a variety of levels
But when it comes to the most important question for all eternity, a public opinion poll cannot give us the answer
We must answer for ourselves
In Matthew 16, Jesus took His disciples to Caesarea Philippi and asked a question about public opinion: 'Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?'
The answers were varied, and all were complimentary, but none was adequate
That's why Jesus then asked His disciples, 'But who do you say that I am?'
Peter got the answer right: 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God'
Public opinion can help answer certain questions, but not the one question that will determine your eternity: Who do you say that Jesus is
If you agree with Scripture, and place your trust in Christ, you will have eternal life.
Until the day I was found, I didn't know I was lost
I was going about business as usual, moving from task to task, distraction to distraction
But then I received an e-mail with the heading: 'I think you're my cousin.'
As I read my cousin's message, I learned that she and another cousin had been searching for my branch of the family for nearly 10 years
The other cousin promised her father, shortly before he died, that she would find his family
I hadn't done anything to get lost, and I didn't have to do anything to be found except acknowledge that I was the person they had been looking for
Learning that they had spent so much time and energy searching for our family made me feel special
This led me to think about the 'lost and found'
parables of Luke 15, the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the lost son
Whenever we wander away from God, whether intentionally like the prodigal son or unintentionally like the sheep, God looks for us
Even though we may not 'feel'
lost, if we have no relationship with God, we are
To be found, we need to realize that God is looking for us and admit that we are separated from Him
By giving up our waywardness, we can be reunited with Him and restored to His family.
In his book Through the Valley of the Kwai, Scottish officer Ernest Gordon wrote of his years as a prisoner of war during World War II
The man suffered from malaria, diphtheria, typhoid, beriberi, dysentery, and jungle ulcers
The hard labor and scarcity of food quickly plunged his weight to less than 100 pounds
The squalor of the prison hospital prompted a desperate Ernest to request to be moved to a cleaner place, the morgue
Lying in the dirt of the death house, he waited to die
But every day, a fellow prisoner came to wash his wounds and to encourage him to eat part of his own rations
As the quiet and unassuming Dusty Miller nursed Ernest back to health, he talked with the agnostic Scotsman of his own strong faith in God and showed him that, even in the midst of suffering, there is hope
The hope we read about in Scripture is not a vague, wishy-washy optimism
Biblical hope is a strong and confident expectation that what God has promised in His Word He will accomplish
Tribulation is often the catalyst that produces perseverance, character, and finally, hope
Seventy years ago, in a brutal POW camp, Ernest Gordon learned this truth himself and said, 'Faith thrives when there is no hope but God'
During the Cold War, a time of tension between the world's superpowers, Albert Einstein said, 'I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.'
It was a moment of clarity that focused on the consequences of the choice to fight a nuclear war
Regardless of the motives for making such a choice, the results would be devastating
Unfortunately, we don't always see ahead with such clarity
Sometimes the implications of our choices are hard to anticipate
And sometimes we are thinking only in the moment
According to Hebrews 11:24-26, Moses looked ahead and made a choice based on possible consequences
'By faith Moses, when he became of age,
Moses' choice wasn't easy, but its rightness was made clear because he knew that the troubles he faced for godly living were made bearable by his coming reward
As we look ahead, are we willing to bear 'the reproach of Christ'?, the tough times that come with being associated with Jesus, in exchange for the promised reward of pleasing God?
In the Roman Empire, pagans would often call on the name of a god or goddess as they placed bets in a game of chance
A favorite deity of the gambler was Aphrodite, the Greek word for Venus, the goddess of love
During the roll of the dice, they would say 'epaphroditus!'
literally, 'by Aphrodite!'
In the book of Philippians we read of a Greek convert to the Christian faith by the name of Epaphroditus
He was a close companion of Paul who served him well in his missionary enterprise
Of his friend, Paul wrote: 'Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier'
Epaphroditus was a spiritual brother in Christ, a faithful worker who shared ministry efforts, a brave soldier of the faith, and the carrier of the inspired letter to the church at Philippi
He modeled brotherhood, a work ethic, spiritual endurance, and service
Certainly, Epaphroditus had a well-deserved reputation that showed he did not live by a pagan deity but by faith in Jesus Christ
Even more important than our name are the Christian qualities that are seen in our life: dependability, care, encouragement, and wisdom
What words would you like others to use to describe you?
The most enjoyable part of the stretch-and-flex exercise class I attend is the last 5 minutes
That's when we lie flat on our backs on our mats with the lights down low for relaxation
During one of those times, our instructor said softly, 'Find a place where you can rest into.'
I thought of the best place to 'rest into'
mentioned in the words of a hymn by Cleland B
McAfee, 'Near to the Heart of God.'
This hymn was written in 1901 after the death of McAfee's two nieces from diphtheria
His church choir sang it outside the quarantined home of his brother, offering words of hope about God's heart of care
The apostle Paul tells us that God has a heart of love for us
Nothing, tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, sword, death, life, angels, principalities, powers, height, nor depth, is able to separate us from the enduring love of our Lord
'If God is for us, who can be against us?'
Whatever our stresses or concerns, the heart of God is the place to 'rest into.'
Leave it all with Him, 'for He cares for you'
On a road trip with a friend, we used his GPS navigation device to guide us as we drove each day
After entering our destination on the screen, a voice told us which road to follow, as well as when and where to make each turn
When we left the route, whether accidentally or deliberately, the voice would say, 'Recalculating.'
Then it would tell us how to get back on the right road
Second Timothy 3:16 describes the Bible as a spiritual navigation system for our journey through life
'All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.'
Doctrine tells us which road to travel; reproof tells us when we are off the road; correction tells us how to get back on; instruction in righteousness tells us how to stay on God's road
The mistakes and choices that detour us from the Lord are not to be taken lightly
But failure is seldom fatal and few decisions are final
The moment we veer off on our own, the Holy Spirit is 'recalculating'
and urging us to return to the Father's way
If we've drifted off course, there's no better time than right now to heed God's voice and return to His road.
One day, my toddler exclaimed, 'I love you, Mom!'
I was curious about what makes a 3-year-old tick
So I asked him why he loved me
He answered, 'Because you play cars with me.'
When I asked if there was any other reason, he said, 'Nope That's it.'
My toddler's response made me smile
But it also made me think about the way I relate to God
Do I love and trust Him just because of what He does for me
What about when the blessings disappear
Job had to answer these questions when catastrophes claimed his children and demolished his entire estate
His wife advised him: 'Curse God and die!'
Instead, Job asked, 'Shall we indeed accept good from God, and shall we not accept adversity?'
Yes, Job struggled after his tragedy, he became angry with his friends and questioned the Almighty
Still, he vowed, 'Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him'
Job's affection for his heavenly Father didn't depend on a tidy solution to his problems
Rather, he loved and trusted God because of all that He is
Job said, 'God is wise in heart and mighty in strength'
Our love for God must not be based solely on His blessings but because of who He is.
The values of the kingdom that Jesus came to establish were radically different than those of His day
The Pharisees and teachers of the law clamored for the spotlight and sought the adulation of the crowds
Many of us still do this today
In Luke 14, Jesus told a parable that taught His followers not to be like that
The parable talks about people who chose the most honored seat for themselves at a wedding feast
He said they would be embarrassed when the host asked them publicly to take their rightful place
Jesus went on in His story to talk about whom to invite to such dinners
He said they shouldn't invite friends and family, but 'when you give a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind
And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you'
Disappointed because you have not broken into the more elite group in your church or neighborhood
Stuck down on rung two when you'd rather be on rung eight or at least climbing the social ladder
Listen to what Jesus said: 'Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted'
That's the radical and upside-down way of God's kingdom!
A mother asked her 5-year-old son to go to the pantry to get her a can of tomato soup
But he refused and protested, 'It's dark in there.'
Mom assured Johnny, 'Don't be afraid
Jesus is in there.'
So Johnny opened the door slowly and seeing that it was dark, shouted, 'Jesus, can you hand me a can of tomato soup?'
This humorous story of Johnny's fear reminds me of Gideon
The Lord appeared to Gideon, calling him a 'mighty man of valor'
and then telling him to deliver Israel out of Midian's hand
But Gideon's fearful reply was, 'My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house'
Even after the Lord told Gideon that with His help he would defeat the Midianites , he was still afraid
Then Gideon asked the Lord for signs to confirm God's will and empowerment
So, why did the Lord address fearful Gideon as a 'mighty man of valor'?
Because of who Gideon would one day become with the Lord's help
We too may doubt our own abilities and potential
But let us never doubt what God can do with us when we trust and obey Him
Gideon's God is the same God who will help us accomplish all that He asks us to do.
Naomi and Ruth came together in less-than-ideal circumstances
To escape a famine in Israel, Naomi's family moved to Moab
While living there, her two sons married Moabite women: Orpah and Ruth
Then Naomi's husband and sons died
In that culture, women were dependent on men, which left the three widows in a predicament
Word came to Naomi that the famine in Israel had ended, so she decided to make the long trek home
Orpah and Ruth started to go with her, but Naomi urged them to return home, saying, 'The hand of the Lord has gone out against me!'
Orpah went home, but Ruth continued, affirming her belief in Naomi's God despite Naomi's own fragile faith
The story started in desperately unpleasant circumstances: famine, death, and despair
It changed direction due to undeserved kindnesses: Ruth to Naomi and Boaz to Ruth
It involved unlikely people: two widows and Boaz, the son of a prostitute
It depended on unexplainable intervention: Ruth just so 'happened'
to glean in the field of Boaz
And it ended in unimaginable blessing: a baby who would be in the lineage of the Messiah
God makes miracles out of what seems insignificant: fragile faith, a little kindness, and ordinary people.
I counted once and discovered that Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address contains fewer than 300 words
This means, among other things, that words don't have to be many to be memorable
That's one reason I like Psalm 117
Brevity is its hallmark
Think about what God's love means
God loved us before we were born; He will love us after we die
Not one thing can separate us from the love of God that is in Jesus our Lord
His heart is an inexhaustible and irrepressible fountain of love
As I read this brief psalm of praise to God, I can think of no greater encouragement for our journey than its reminder of God's merciful kindness
Praise the Lord!
Amid the celebration, there was tragedy
It was the opening ceremonies of the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona
One by one the teams entered the stadium and paraded around the track to the cheers of 65,000 people
But in one section of Olympic Stadium, shock and sadness fell as Peter Karnaugh, father of United States swimmer Ron Karnaugh, was stricken with a fatal heart attack
Five days later, Ron showed up for his race wearing his dad's hat, which he carefully set aside before his competition began
Why the hat
It was the swimmer's tribute to his dad, whom he described as 'my best friend.'
The hat was one his dad had worn when they went fishing and did other things together
Wearing the hat was Ron's way of honoring his dad for standing beside him, encouraging him, and guiding him
When Ron dove into the water, he did so without his dad's presence but inspired by his memory
On this Father's Day, there are many ways to honor our fathers, as Scripture commands us to do
One way, even if they're no longer with us, is to show respect for the good values they taught us
What can you do for your dad today to show him the kind of honor the Bible talks about?
I enjoy playing golf, so I occasionally watch instructional videos
One such video, however, left me disappointed
The teacher presented a golf swing that had at least 8 steps and a dozen sub-points under each step
That was just too much information
While I'm not a great golfer, years of playing have taught me this: The more thoughts you have in your head as you swing, the less likely you are to be successful
You must simplify your thought process and focus on what matters most, making solid contact with the ball
The instructor's many points got in the way
In golf and in life, we must focus on what matters most
In Philippians 3, Paul describes how that relates to the Christian
Rather than being distracted by lesser things, he wanted to focus on what mattered most
He said, 'One thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead, I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus'
'One thing I do.'
In a world of distractions, it's vital for the child of God to stay focused, and there is no better point of focus in the universe than Jesus Christ Himself
Is He what matters most to you?
Money is a powerful force
We work for it, save it, spend it, use it to satisfy our earthside longings, and then wish we had more
Aware of its distracting danger, Jesus taught more about money than any other topic
And, as far as we know, He never took an offering for Himself
Clearly, He didn't teach about giving to fill His own pockets
Instead, Jesus warned us that trusting in wealth and using it to gain power clogs our spiritual arteries more readily than most other impediments to spiritual development
In telling the story of the 'rich fool,'
He shamed His listeners for not being rich toward God , indicating that God has a far different definition of wealth than most of us
So, what does it mean to be rich toward God
Paul tells us that those who are rich should not be conceited about their wealth, 'nor to trust in uncertain riches'
Rather, we are to 'be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share'
Interesting
God measures wealth by the quality of our lives and our generous disbursement of wealth to bless others
Not exactly Wall Street insider talk, but great advice for those of us who think that our security and reputation are tied up in the size of our bank account.
In the aftermath of Haiti's devastating earthquake in January 2010, the scenes of destruction and death were often punctuated by someone being pulled alive from the rubble, even after all hope seemed gone
Relief and tears of joy were followed by deep gratitude toward those who worked around the clock, often risking their own lives to give someone else another chance to live
How would you feel if it happened to you
Have you ever been rescued
In Colossians 1, Paul wrote to people who had come to know Jesus Christ and whose lives showed evidence of their faith
After assuring them of his prayers for them to know God's will and to please Him, Paul used a powerful word picture to describe what God had done for them all: 'He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins'
In Christ, we have been rescued
He has taken us from danger to safety; from one power and destiny to another; from death to life
It's worth pondering all that being rescued means to us, as we thank God for His grace and power.
Do I really have to read Leviticus?'
A young executive asked me this in earnest as we talked about the value of spending time in reading the Bible
'The Old Testament seems so boring and difficult,' he said
Many Christians feel this way
The answer, of course, is that the Old Testament, including Leviticus, offers background and even contrasts essential to grasping the New Testament
While Isaiah challenges us to seek God , he also promises us that God's Word accomplishes what the Lord wants it to accomplish
Scripture is alive and powerful , and it is useful to teach, correct, and instruct us
God's Word never returns void , but sometimes it is not until later that God's words come to mind as we need them
The Holy Spirit uses the truths we've stored from reading or memorization, and He helps us to apply them at just the right time
For example, Leviticus 19:10-11 speaks of business competition and even caring for the poor
The Spirit can remind us of these concepts, and we can use them, if we've spent time reading and contemplating that passage
Reading the Bible turns our minds into storehouses through which the Spirit can work
That's a great reason to read Leviticus and the other 65 books as well.
Every parent knows the difference between rules designed primarily for the benefit of the parent and those designed for the benefit of the child
God's rules fall into the latter category
As Creator of the human race, God knows how human society will work best
I began to look at the Ten Commandments in this light, as rules designed primarily for our benefit
Jesus underscored this principle when He said, 'The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath'
The Bible is a most realistic book
It assumes human beings will be tempted to lust after a neighbor or covet someone else's property, to work too hard, to strike out in anger at those who wrong them
It assumes humanity will bring disorder to whatever we touch
Each of the Ten Commandments offers a shield of protection against that disorder
We have the freedom to say no to our sinful inclinations
By doing so, we avoid certain harm
Taken together, the Ten Commandments weave life on this planet into a more meaningful and structured whole
The benefit of which is to allow us to live as a peaceful, healthy community under God.
The Trans-Alaska Pipeline stretches 800 miles through Alaska
Because it was built through an earthquake zone, engineers had to be sure the pipe could withstand earth trauma
Engineers were delighted when the first big test came
In 2002, an earthquake occurred causing the ground to move 18 feet to one side
The Teflon sliders moved gently to accommodate the movement without any damage to the pipe
The key was flexibility
The believer's spiritual pipeline to heaven is built upon firm trust in God
But if we are inflexible in our expectations of how God should work, we can run into trouble
In a crisis, we can make the mistake of shifting our focus from God to our painful circumstances
Our prayer should be, 'God, I don't understand why You have allowed this painful situation
But I am trusting in Your ultimate deliverance despite all that's going on around me.'
The psalmist expressed this so well when he wrote: 'My soul trusts in You
until these calamities have passed by'
When the earth seems to move under us, let's be flexible in our expectations but firmly confident in God's steadfast love and care.
We like to read about comebacks, about people or companies who face near disaster and turn things around
The Ford Motor Company is an example of that
In the 1940s, a reluctance by leadership to modernize almost destroyed Ford
In fact, the government nearly took over the company lest its demise threaten the US war effort
But when Henry Ford II was released from his military duties to run the company, things turned around
Ford became one of the biggest corporations in the world
Occasionally, we need a comeback
We need to correct wrong directions or compensate for wrong decisions
In those times, we have an example in Peter
He had failure written all over him
First, he nearly drowned when his faith faltered
Then he said things that were so wrong Jesus called him 'Satan'
And when Jesus needed Peter the most, he denied that he even knew Him
But that's not the end of the story
In the power of the Spirit, Peter made a comeback
On the Day of Pentecost, he preached and 3,000 people came to faith in Christ
Peter returned to effectiveness because his faith was renewed, he guarded what he said, and he stood up for Jesus
If Peter can come back, so can you
Weddings have long been an occasion for extravagance
Modern weddings have become a chance for young women to live out the fantasy of being 'a princess for a day.'
An elegant gown, an elaborate hairstyle, attendants in color-coordinated dresses, bouquets of flowers, an abundance of food, and lots of celebrating with friends and family contribute to the fairytale atmosphere
Many parents start saving early so they can afford the high cost of making their daughter's dream come true
And royal weddings take extravagance to a level that we 'commoners'
seldom see
In 1981, however, many of us got a peek at one when the wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana was broadcast worldwide
Another royal wedding is in the planning stages, and it will be more elaborate than any other
But in this wedding, the most important person will be the groom, Christ Himself; and we, the church, will be His bride
John's revelation says that the bride will make herself ready and that our wedding gown will be our righteous acts
Though earthly marriages last only a lifetime, every bride works hard to make her wedding perfect
How much more, as the bride of Christ, should we be doing to prepare ourselves for a marriage that will last for eternity.
In some cultures, the title below your name on your business card is very important
It identifies your rank
The way you are treated depends on your title as compared with others around you
If Paul had a business card, it would have identified him as an 'apostle'
meaning 'sent one.'
He used this title not out of pride but out of wonder
He didn't earn that position; it was 'by the commandment of God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ.'
In other words, his was not a human but a divine appointment
Paul had formerly been a 'blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man'
He said that he considered himself to be the 'chief' of sinners
But because of God's mercy, he was now an apostle, one to whom 'the King eternal'
had committed the glorious gospel and whom He had sent out to share that gospel
What is more amazing is that like the apostle Paul we are all sent out by the King of kings to the world
Let's recognize with humility that we don't deserve such a commission either
It is our privilege to represent Him and His eternal truth in word and in deed each day to all around us.
When my wife and I were traveling in another state, someone broke into our car after we stopped for lunch
With one look at the shattered glass, we realized that we had forgotten to put our GPS out of sight
With a quick check of the backseat, I concluded that the thief also got my laptop, passport, and checkbook
Then came the surprise
Later that evening, after phone calls and hours of growing worries, the unexpected happened
When I opened my suitcase, tucked between my clothes was what I thought I had lost
I couldn't believe my eyes
Only then did I recall that I had not put the items in the backseat after all
I had stuck them in the suitcase, which had been safely stored in the trunk of our car
Sometimes, in the emotion of the moment, our minds play tricks on us
We think our loss is worse than it is
We may feel like the songwriter David who, in the confusion of the moment, thought God had forgotten him
When David later recalled what he knew rather than what he feared, his sense of loss turned into a song of praise
His renewed joy foreshadowed what is now ours to recall: Nothing can rob us of what is most important if our life is 'hidden with Christ in God'
My wife, Martie, is a great cook
Sitting down after a busy day to enjoy her culinary delights is a real treat
Sometimes after dinner she runs errands, leaving me alone with the choice of grabbing the remote or cleaning up the kitchen
When I'm on my good behavior, I roll up my sleeves, load the dishwasher, and scrub the pots and pans, all for the joy of hearing Martie's grateful response, which is usually something like, 'Wow, Joe
You didn't have to clean up the kitchen!'
Which gives me a chance to say, 'I wanted to show you how much I love you!'
When Jesus reproved the church at Ephesus for abandoning their 'first love'
it was because they were doing a lot of good things, but not out of love for Him
Although they were praised for their perseverance and patience, from Christ's point of view, they were being good for nothing
Good behavior should always be an act of worship
Resisting temptation, forgiving, serving, and loving each other are all opportunities to tangibly express our love for Jesus, not to get a star next to our name or a pat on the back
When was the last time you did something 'good'
out of love for Jesus?
When Polycarp , who was bishop of the church at Smyrna, was asked by Roman authorities to curse Christ if he wanted to be released, he said, 'Eighty-six years I have served Him, and He never did me any wrong
How can I blaspheme my King who saved me?'
The Roman officer threatened, 'If you do not change your mind, I will have you consumed with fire.'
Polycarp remained undaunted
Because he would not curse Christ, he was burned at the stake
Centuries earlier, when three young men named Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego faced a similar threat, they answered, 'O Nebuchadnezzar, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king
But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods'
A similar experience but two different outcomes
Polycarp was burned alive, but Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego left the furnace unsinged
Two different results but the same display of faith
These men showed us that faith in God is not simply faith in what God can do
But it's the belief that God is God whether He delivers us or not
He has the final say
And it's our decision to choose to follow Him through it all.
Following a recent lunch discussion, I decided to research the comment that a bull shark attack had once occurred in Lake Michigan
It seemed like such an impossible thought that we all scoffed at the idea of sharks in a freshwater lake so far inland
I found one online site that claimed a bull shark attack did occur in Lake Michigan in 1955, but it was never verified
A shark attack in Lake Michigan
If the story were true, it would definitely be a rare occurrence
Wouldn't it be great if hard times were like Lake Michigan bull shark attacks, rare or even untrue
But they aren't
Hardships and difficulties are common
It's just that when they happen to us, we think they shouldn't
Perhaps that is why the apostle Peter, writing to first-century followers of Christ going through tough times, said, 'Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you'
These trials are not abnormal, and once we get past our surprise, we can turn to the Father who ministers deeply to our hearts and in our lives
He has a love that never fails
And in our world filled with trials, that kind of love is desperately needed.
During an international publishing conference, a young Frenchman described his experience at a book- signing event
A woman picked up one of his books, browsed through it, and exclaimed, 'At last, a story that's clean!'
He replied gently, 'I write clean because I think clean
It's not an effort.'
What he expressed in print came from within, where Christ had altered the very core of his life
John 15 records Jesus' lesson to His disciples about abiding in Him as the only means to a fruitful life
In the midst of His imagery of the vine and the branches, Jesus said: 'You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you'
Bible scholar WE Vine says that the Greek word for clean means 'free from impure admixture, without blemish, spotless.'
A pure heart is the work of Christ, and only in His power can we remain clean
We often fail, but 'if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to
cleanse us from all unright-eousness'
Renewal is an inside job
Jesus has made us clean through His sacrifice and His Word
Our speech and actions that strike others as being fresh and pure flow from inside out as we abide in Christ.
Over the past several years, I've been privileged to travel with teenagers on eight mission trips
One thing I've learned in those excursions is that teens are not too young to make an impact for Jesus, either on me or on others whose lives they touch
I've also noticed that the teens who make the biggest impact for Christ match the characteristics Paul told Timothy about in 1 Timothy 4:12
Trying to convince Timothy that his relative youth did not have to be a deterrent to his ministry, Paul told him to 'be an example to the believers'
in several areas
In word: Young people who make a difference for Christ control what they say, avoid negative talk, and speak words that honor God
In conduct: Teens who practice discretion in their behavior shine for all the world to see
In love: By taking heed of Jesus' words to love God and their neighbor teens please Jesus and touch hearts
In faith: Those who put their faith into action change lives
In purity: It's tough to be morally pure and doctrinally sound, but kids who are can set the bar for the rest of us
Paul's words aren't just for the young generation
All of us should be an example in word, conduct, love, faith, and purity
That's how we make an impact for Christ.
The book of Jonah has the makings of a great movie plot
It contains a runaway prophet, a terrible storm at sea, the prophet swallowed by a great fish, God sparing the prophet's life, and the repentance of a pagan city
But Jonah's sequel, the book of Nahum, might not be so popular
Nahum ministered in Nineveh just as Jonah had, but about 100 years later
This time, the Ninevites had no interest in repentance
Because of this, Nahum condemns Nineveh and proclaims judgment on the people
To unrepentant Nineveh, the prophet preached: 'The Lord is slow to anger and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked'
But Nahum also had a message of mercy
To comfort the people of Judah, he proclaimed: 'The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and He knows those who trust in Him'
We see in the stories of Jonah and Nahum that with every new generation comes the necessity of an individual response to God
No one's spiritual life can be handed off to another; we must each choose to serve the Lord from our own heart
God's message is as fresh today as it was hundreds of years ago: judgment for the unrepentant but mercy for the repentant
How will you respond?
My state's name, 'Idaho,'
according to one legend, comes from a Shoshone Indian word, 'ee-dah-how.'
When translated into English, it means something like, 'Behold
The sun rising over the mountain.'
I often think of that when the sun breaks over the eastern peaks and spills light and life into our valley
Also, I think of Malachi's promise: 
The Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings
This is God's irrevocable promise that our Lord Jesus will come again and all creation 'will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God'
Each new sunrise is a reminder of that eternal morning when 'bright heaven's Sun'
will arise with healing in His wings
Then everything that has been made will be made over and made irrevocably right
There will be no throbbing backs or knees, no financial struggles, no losses, no aging
One Bible version says that when Jesus returns we will 'go out and leap like calves released from the stall'
This is my highest imagination and my hope
Jesus said, 'Surely I am coming quickly'
Even so, come, Lord Jesus!
Chuck had slowed to a stop when his car was hit from behind and was pushed into the vehicle ahead of him
A sickening, crunching sound indicated that additional vehicles had collided behind them
As Chuck sat quietly for a moment, he observed that the vehicle directly behind him was pulling out into traffic
Obviously hoping to avoid an encounter with police, the escaping driver neglected to notice he had left something behind
When the police arrived, an officer picked up the hit-and-run driver's license plate from the ground and said to Chuck, 'Someone will be waiting for him when he arrives home
He won't get away with this.'
Scripture tells us
'be sure your sin will find you out'
, as this man who fled the accident discovered
We may sometimes be able to hide our sin from the people around us, but nothing is ever 'hidden from [God's] sight'
He sees each of our failures, thoughts, and motivations
Believers are given a wonderful promise: 'If we confess our sins, [God] is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
So don't let unconfessed, so-called 'hidden'
An elderly TV star was asked by talk-show host Larry King about heaven
King prefaced his question by referring to Billy Graham, who had told King he 'knew what would be ahead
It would be paradise
He was going to heaven.'
King then asked his guest, 'What do you believe?'
He replied, 'I'd like a lot of activity
Heaven sounds too placid for me
There's a lot to do in hell.'
Sadly, this man is not alone in thinking that an existence in Satan's realm is a preferred destination
I've heard people say that they'd rather be in hell because all their friends will be there
One person wrote, 'If hell was real, I don't think it would be bad
There would be a lot of interesting people
How can we convince folks who are deceived in this way that hell and its horrors are to be avoided
Perhaps by telling them of the realities of hell that are presented in the Scripture
In Daniel 12:2, it is described as a place of 'shame and everlasting contempt
Luke 16:23 talks about torments
Matthew 8:12 describes weeping and gnashing of teeth
And Revelation 14:11 says there will be no rest
Biblical truth doesn't allow anyone to think that hell might be a good place to be
Clearly, rejecting Jesus and facing an eternity in Satan's kingdom is a bad choice.
I've always been impressed by the solemn, magnificent simplicity of the Changing of the Guard at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery
The carefully choreographed event is a moving tribute to soldiers whose names, and sacrifice, are 'known but to God.'
Equally moving are the private moments of steady pacing when the crowds are gone: back and forth, hour after hour, day by day, in even the worst weather
In September 2003, Hurricane Isabel was bearing down on Washington, DC, and the guards were told they could seek shelter during the worst of the storm
Surprising almost no one, the guards refused
They unselfishly stood their post to honor their fallen comrades even in the face of a hurricane
Underlying Jesus' teaching in Matthew 6:1-6, I believe, is His desire for us to live with an unrelenting, selfless devotion to Him
The Bible calls us to good deeds and holy living, but these are to be acts of worship and obedience , not orchestrated acts for self-glorification
The apostle Paul endorses this whole-life faithfulness when he pleads with us to make our bodies 'a living sacrifice'
May our private and public moments speak of our devotion and wholehearted commitment to You, Lord.
On a recent trip, my wife was seated near a mother with a young boy on his first flight
As the plane took off, he exclaimed, 'Mom, look how high we are
And everything's getting smaller!'
A few minutes later he shouted, 'Are those clouds down there
What are they doing under us'
As time passed, other passengers read, dozed, and lowered their window shades to watch the in-flight video
This boy, however, remained glued to the window, absorbed in the wonder of all he was seeing
For experienced travelers in the Christian life, there can be great danger in losing the wonder
The Scriptures that once thrilled us may become more familiar and academic
We may fall into the lethargy of praying with our minds but not our hearts
Peter urged the early followers of Christ to continue growing in their faith, virtue, knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness, brotherly kindness, and love
He said, 'If these things are yours and abound [or are increasing], you will be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ'
Without them we become blind and forget the marvel of being cleansed from our sins
May God grant us all grace to keep growing in the wonder of knowing Him.
He was frustrated
He was angry
He was tired of being blamed for everything that went wrong
Year after year, he had gotten them through one disaster after another
He was continually interceding on their behalf to keep them out of trouble
But all he got for his efforts was more grief
Finally, in exasperation, he said, 'Hear now, you rebels
Must we bring water for you out of this rock?'
That suggestion might sound preposterous, but it wasn't
Forty years earlier, the previous generation had the same complaint: no water
God told Moses to strike a rock with his staff
When he obeyed, water gushed out, plenty of water
When the grumbling started again so many years later, Moses did the thing that worked before
But this time it was the wrong thing to do
What Moses told the Israelites to do, to listen, he himself had not done
God had told him to speak to the rock this time, not strike it
Sometimes in exhaustion or exasperation, we don't pay close attention to God
We assume He will always work the same way
But He doesn't
Sometimes He tells us to act; sometimes He tells us to speak; sometimes He tells us to wait
That is why we must always be careful to listen before we take action.
During the era of great sea exploration in the 15th and 16th centuries, sailing ships traversed vast, hazardous oceans and navigated dangerous coastlines
Pilots used various navigation techniques, including a book called a 'rutter'
This was a log of events kept by earlier voyagers who chronicled their encounters with previously unknown and difficult waters
By reading the sailing details in a rutter, captains could avoid hazards and make it through difficult waters
In many ways, the Christian life is like a voyage, and the believer needs help in navigating life's perilous seas
We have that help because God has given us His Word as a 'spiritual rutter.'
Often when we reflect on a meaningful passage, we can recall God's faithfulness through trying circumstances
As the psalmist suggests, perils are found not only in life situations but also in our inner tendency toward sin
Because of these dual concerns, he wrote, 'Direct my steps by Your Word, and let no iniquity have dominion over me'
As you reflect on the teaching in the Bible, you'll be reminded of God's past care, assured of the Lord's guidance in trying circumstances, and warned against sinfulness
That's the advantage of having a 'spiritual rutter.'?
In early 1994, when our family found out that the US soccer team would be playing in Michigan in the World Cup, we knew we had to go
What a great time we had as we went to the Pontiac Silverdome to see the US take on Switzerland
It was one of the most remarkable events of our lives
There was just one problem
One of our four children, 9-year-old Melissa, couldn't join us
While we enjoyed the event, it was not the same without her
Even in our joy at being there, we felt sadness because of her absence
As I think back on that day, I'm reminded that our sadness then is a little like our sadness now that Melissa is gone from this life, having died in a car accident 8 years after that game
While we cherish the help of the 'God of all comfort'
even that great comfort doesn't change the reality of her empty chair at family gatherings
Scripture doesn't tell us that God wipes away our sadness in this life, but it does tell us that God is faithful and will comfort us
If you have lost a loved one, lean heavily on God's comfort
Keep trusting Him
But know that it's okay to feel sadness for this absence
Consider it one more reason to place your burdens on your loving heavenly Father.
I've been amazed at the impact that my wife, Martie, has had on the lives of our kids
Very few roles demand the kind of unconditional, self-sacrificing perseverance and commitment as that of motherhood
I know for certain that my character and faith have been shaped and molded by my mom, Corabelle
Let's face it, where would we be without our wives and mothers
It reminds me of one of my favorite memories in sports history
Phil Mickelson walked up the 18th fairway at the Masters Golf Tournament in 2010 after his final putt to clinch one of golf's most coveted prizes for the third time
But it wasn't his victory leap on the green that had an impact on me
It was when he made a beeline through the crowd to his wife, who was battling life-threatening cancer
They embraced, and the camera caught a tear running down Phil's cheek as he held his wife close for a long time
Our wives need to experience the kind of sacrificial, selfless love that has been shown to us by the Lover of our souls
As Paul put it, 'Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her'
Prizes come and go, but it's the people you love, and who love you, that matter most.
In a radio interview, a basketball superstar was asked about his knack for making the game-winning shot in crucial situations
The reporter asked how he was able to be so calm in such pressure-packed moments
His answer was that he tried to simplify the situation
You only have to make one shot, the player replied
One shot
That is the essence of simplifying a difficult situation
Focus only on what is in front of you right now
Don't worry about the expectations of your coach or teammates
Simplify
Recognizing that the challenges of life can be both overwhelming and suffocating, Jesus urged us to take matters in hand by simplifying
He said, 'Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things
Sufficient for the day is its own trouble'
This was His wise conclusion to His teaching on the debilitating power of worry
Worry doesn't accomplish anything positive; it just adds to the sense that we are drowning in the troubles we are facing
We must take things as they come­, one day at a time­, and trust Him for the wisdom to respond properly
If you feel overwhelmed by life, do what you can today and then entrust the rest to Him
As Jesus said, 'Each day has enough trouble of its own'
While enjoying the arrival of a new great-niece, I was reminded of how much work it is to take care of a newborn baby
They are needy little creations who want feeding, changing, holding, feeding, changing, holding, feeding, changing, holding
Totally unable to care for themselves, they depend on those older and wiser people surrounding them
We're dependent children too, reliant on our Father in heaven
What do we need from Him that we can't provide for ourselves
In Him we live and move and have our being'
He supplies our very breath
He also meets our needs 'according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus
We need our Father for peace in our troubles , love , and help in time of need
He gives victory in temptation , forgiveness , purpose , and eternal life
Without Him, we 'can do nothing'
And from Him, 'we have all received one blessing after another'
Let's not think of ourselves as totally independent, because we're not
The Lord sustains us day by day
In many ways, we're as needy as a newborn baby.
A friend of mine pastors a church in a small mountain community not far from Boise, Idaho
The community is nestled in a wooded valley through which a pleasant little stream meanders
Behind the church and alongside the stream is a grove of willows, a length of grass, and a sandy beach
It's an idyllic spot that has long been a place where members of the community gather to picnic
One day, a man in the congregation expressed concern over the legal implications of 'outsiders' using the property
If someone is injured, he said, the church might be sued
Though the elders were reluctant to take any action, the man convinced them that they should post a sign on the site informing visitors that this was private property
Anyone using this beach may, at any moment, be surrounded by people who love you
I read his sign the week after he put it up and was charmed
Exactly, I thought
Once again grace has triumphed over law
This love for one's neighbor springs from God's kindness, forbearance, and patience with us
It's not the law, but the goodness of God that draws men and women to repentance and to saving faith in His Son Jesus Christ.
I love the old photographs that are often printed on the obituary page of our local newspaper
A grinning young man in a military uniform and words such as: 92 years old, fought for his country in WW II
Or the young woman with sparkling eyes: 89 years young, grew up on a farm in Kansas during the Depression
Too often, those who have had a long life feel sidelined when they reach their later years
Psalm 92, however, reminds us that no matter how old we are, we can have a fresh and fruitful life
Men and women who have been planted in the rich soil of God's vineyard will continue to bear fruit and be fresh and flourishing
Jesus promised that he who abides in Me, and I in him, will continue to bear much fruit
Yes, muscles may ache and joints may hurt, and life may slow down a bit
But inwardly we can be renewed day by day
I recently saw a T-shirt on a beautiful white-haired woman that said: 'I'm not 80
I'm 18 with 62 years experience.
No matter how old we get, we can still be young at heart, but with the benefit of a well-lived lifetime of knowledge and wisdom.
While reading the first chapter of James, I was struck by the phrase 'humbly accept the Word planted in you, which can save you'
A decision with which I'd been struggling came to mind, and I thought: I don't need to read another book, attend another seminar, or ask another friend about this
I need to obey what the Bible tells me to do
My efforts to be better informed had become a means of resisting God's instruction rather than receiving it
James was writing to followers of Christ when he said: 'Lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted Word, which is able to save your souls
But be doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves'
Bible scholar WE Vine said that the Greek word used here for receive means 'deliberate and ready reception of what is offered.'
Meekness is an attitude toward God 'in which we accept His dealings with us as good, and therefore without disputing or resisting.'
A humble heart doesn't fight against God or contend with Him
God's powerful Word, implanted in our hearts, is a trustworthy source of spiritual wisdom and strength
It's available to all who will humbly receive it.
I watched from my balcony as a 20-story apartment building was demolished
The demolition took barely a week to complete
In its place a new building is being constructed
It's been months now, and despite construction activities going on nights and weekends, it is still incomplete
How much easier it is to tear down than to build up
What is true for demolition and construction of buildings is also true for personal relationships
In Philippians 4:2, Paul wrote to two women in the church, saying, 'I implore Euodia and I implore Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord.'
The quarrel between these two women threatened to tear down the witness of the Philippian church if left unresolved
So Paul urged a true companion to help rebuild that relationship
Sadly, Christians do quarrel, but we should seek to live peaceably with all
Unless our conflicts are resolved, the Christian witness so painstakingly built up can be destroyed
It takes much effort and time to reconcile broken relationships
But it is worth it
Like a new building rising from the ruins, reconciled believers can emerge stronger
May we seek to build each other up through our words and actions today!
Being afflicted with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, Thomas DeBaggio chronicled his gradual memory loss in the book Losing My Mind
This book records the disturbing process by which, little by little, tasks, places, and people are all forgotten
Alzheimer's disease involves the failure of nerve cells in the brain, leading to gradual memory loss, confusion, and disorientation
It can be tragic to watch a previously mentally alert person slowly forget how to dress or fail to recognize the faces of loved ones
It's like losing the person before he dies
Memory loss can occur by other means as well, such as injury or life trauma
And for those of us who live into old age, the breakdown of our bodies is inevitable
But for the Christian, there is hope
When believers receive their glorified bodies at the resurrection, they will be perfect
But even more important, in heaven we will recognize the One who died to redeem us
We will remember what He did and know Him by the nail prints in His hands
Forgetfulness may beset our earthly bodies, but when we see the Lord, 'We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is'
One Sunday while preaching, a pastor was accosted and punched by a man
He continued preaching, and the man was arrested
The pastor prayed for him and even visited him in jail a few days later
What an example of the way to respond to insult and injury
While there is a place for self-defense, personal revenge was forbidden in the Old Testament: 'You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself'
It was also forbidden by Jesus and the apostles
The Old Testament law exacted like for like , which ensured that judicial punishment was not unjust or malicious
But there was a larger principle looming when it came to personal revenge: Justice must be done, but it must be left in the hands of God or the authorities ordained by God
Instead of returning injury and insult, may we live by Christ-honoring and Spirit-empowered alternatives: Live at peace with everyone , submit to a spiritual mediator , and leave it in the hands of authorities and, most of all, in God's hands.
Have you ever felt that life is unfair
For those of us who are committed to following the will and ways of Jesus, it's easy to get frustrated when people who don't care about Him seem to do well in life
A businessman cheats yet wins a large contract, and the guy who parties all the time is robust and healthy while you or your loved ones struggle with finances or medical issues
It makes us feel cheated, like maybe we've been good for nothing
If you've ever felt that way, you're in good company
The writer of Psalm 73 goes through a whole list of how the wicked prosper, and then he says, 'Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain'
But the tide of his thoughts turns when he recalls his time in God's presence: Then I understood their end
When we spend time with God and see things from His point of view, it changes our perspective completely
We may be jealous of the nonbelievers now, but we won't be at judgment time
As the saying goes, what difference does it make if you win the battle but lose the war
Like the psalmist, let's praise God for His presence in this life and His promise of the life to come
He is all you need, even when life seems unfair.
The book titled UnChristian lists reasons why some non-Christians don't like people who profess faith in Jesus Christ
Their major complaints have to do with the way some Christians act toward unbelievers
The unbelievers in the study tended to view Christians as being hypocritical, judgmental, harsh, and unloving toward people not like themselves
I'm sure you dislike hearing their view of Christians as I do
Sometimes there's more truth in their perceptions than we wish there was
In 1 John 3, which begins with the words, 'Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!'
John introduces a sharp contrast: Believers love righteousness, keep themselves from sin, and love one another; nonbelievers practice sin, hate others, and abide in death
These are strong words
We are either followers of Jesus Christ or of the devil
We are like Cain or Abel
John says that love for others is what proves we are genuine children of God
We can't continue to practice sin and claim to be followers of Christ
Let's always make sure our words and deeds back up our beliefs.
Children want things now: 'But I want dessert now!'
'Are we there yet?'
'Now can we open our presents?'
In contrast, as we get older we learn to wait
Medical students wait through training
Parents wait in hopes that the prodigal will return
We wait for what is worth waiting for, and in the process we learn patience
God, who is timeless, requires of us a mature faith that may involve delays that seem like trials
Patience is one sign of that maturity, a quality that can develop only through the passing of time
Many prayers in the Bible come out of the act of waiting
Jacob waited 7 years for a wife and then worked 7 more after being tricked by her father
The Israelites waited 4 centuries for deliverance; Moses waited 4 decades for the call to lead them, then 4 more decades for a Promised Land he would not enter
My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning wrote the psalmist
The picture comes to mind of a watchman counting the minutes for his shift to be over
I pray for the patience to endure times of trial, to keep anticipating, keep hoping, keep believing
I pray for patience to be patient.
Recently, I heard of a sport that challenges my imagination, I can't comprehend why anyone would play it
It's called 'Toe Wrestling.'
Every year, people from across the globe gather in England for the world championships
Competitors sit on the ground facing each other and then lock the big toe of the other's bare foot
The object is to pin the opponent's foot in a manner similar to the way an arm wrestler pins a competitor's wrist
It sounds strange to me
In a way, this unusual competition gives honor to a part of the body that's largely ignored, until we drop something on it
Our toes and feet are vital parts of our anatomy, yet we pay little attention to them unless they hurt
Perhaps that's why Paul used the foot to remind us that there are no unimportant parts in the body of Christ
In 1 Corinthians 12:15, he said, 'If the foot should say, '\sBecause I am not a hand, I am not of the body,' is it therefore not of the body?'
The only correct answer: Of course it's part of the body.
Paul wants us to realize that each person in the body of Christ is important
Even if you think of yourself as the most overlooked and ignored member of the body of Christ, you have value
And you can honor God like a true champion by using your unique skills for God's glory.
As 19-year-old Amelia waited in her doctor's office, she recognized the familiar hymn Softly and Tenderly Jesus Is Calling playing over the speaker
It made her smile when she remembered the words
Perhaps a song with the lyrics 'shadows are gathering, deathbeds are coming' was not the most appropriate background music for a doctor's office
Some find this old hymn too sentimental for their taste
But the message of the chorus can be encouraging for the wayward sinner: Come home, come home,  Ye who are weary, come home;  Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,  Calling, 'O sinner, come home!'
When a believer replaces God's will with his own, he will find himself in a backslidden condition, out of fellowship with God, in an unenviable state
Although we sometimes yield to our self-centered nature, God is always ready to welcome us back
Because of His loving kindness and tender mercies, it gives Him joy when we forsake our rebellious ways, return to Him, and ask for forgiveness
Has your heart and mind slipped away from your Savior
Jesus is calling and waiting for you to come back home.
In 1860, Thomas Inman recommended that his fellow doctors not prescribe a medicine for a cure if they weren't sure it would work
They were to give the patient 'the benefit of our doubts.'
This phrase is also a legal term meaning that if a jury has conflicting evidence that makes the jurors doubtful, they are to give the verdict of 'not guilty.'
Perhaps as Christians, we can learn from and apply this medical and legal phrase to our relationships
Better yet, we can learn from the Bible about giving the benefit of the doubt to others
First Corinthians 13:7 says that love 'bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.'
Leon Morris, in the Tyndale New Testament Commentaries, says this about the phrase 'believes all things'?: 'To see the best in others
This does not mean that love is gullible, but that it does not think the worst
It retains its faith
Love is not deceived
but it is always ready to give the benefit of the doubt.'
When we hear something negative about others or we're suspicious about the motive for their actions, let's stop before we judge their intentions as wrong or bad
Let's give them the benefit of the doubt.
Can you tell me where I can find the lightbulbs'
Sure Come with me, and I'll take you to them.'
In many large stores, employees are instructed to take customers to find what they are looking for rather than simply giving them verbal directions
This common act of courtesy and walking alongside an inquiring person may help us expand our concept of what it means to lead others to Christ
In John 1, the phrase come and see occurs twice
When two curious disciples of John the Baptist asked Jesus where He was staying, the Lord said, Come and see
After spending the day with Him, Andrew found his brother, Simon Peter, and brought him to Jesus
Later, Philip told Nathanael he had found the Messiah
To Nathanael's skeptical reply, Philip said, Come and see
Witnessing for Christ can be a one-time event when we speak the good news about Him to others
But it may also involve walking alongside people who are seeking help and wholeness
Our genuine interest in their spiritual welfare, our prayers, and our involvement with them say without words, Come and see
Let's walk together, and I'll take you to Him.
At the end of my mother's earthly journey, she and Dad were still very much in love and shared a strong faith in Christ
My mother had developed dementia and began to lose memories of even her family
Yet Dad would regularly visit her at the assisted living home and find ways to accommodate her diminished capacities
For instance, he would take her some saltwater taffy, unwrap a piece, and place it in her mouth, something she could not do for herself
Then as she slowly chewed the candy, Dad would quietly sit with her and hold her hand
When their time together was over, Dad, beaming with a wide smile, would say, I feel such peace and joy spending time with her.
Though touched by Dad's great joy in helping Mom, I was more affected by the reality that he was depicting God's grace
Jesus was willing to humble Himself to connect with us in our weaknesses
In reflecting on Christ's incarnation, John wrote, 'The Word became flesh and dwelt among us'
Taking on human limitations, He did countless acts of compassion to accommodate us in our weakness
Do you know anyone who might benefit from Jesus' helpful, accommodating love that could flow through you to them today?
When I stuck my camera into the bush to take a picture of the baby robins, they opened their mouths without opening their eyes
They were so used to having mama robin feed them whenever the branches moved that they didn't even look to see who was causing the disturbance
That is the kind of trust that loving mothers instill in their children
That is the kind of mom I am blessed to have
Growing up, I could eat whatever food she put on the table without fear that it would harm me
Although she made me eat things I didn't like, I knew she did so because they were good for me
If she cared only about what was easy for her, she would have let me eat junk food
No matter what Mom told me to do, or not to do, I knew she had my best interest in mind
She wasn't trying to keep me from having fun; she was trying to protect me from being hurt
That is the kind of relationship we have with God, who compared Himself to a mother: As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you
As His children, we have no reason to fear what happens to us nor to envy what happens to others: Do not be envious of the workers of iniquity
When we trust His goodness, we are fed by His faithfulness.
When the US Civil War ended in 1865, more than half a million soldiers lay dead, the economy was shattered, and people remained deeply divided politically
The observance of Mother's Day in the United States began with two women's efforts for peace and reconciliation during this time of anguish
In 1870, Julia Ward Howe called for an International Mother's Day on which women would unite in opposing war in all its forms
A few years later, Anna Reeves Jarvis began her annual Mother's Friendship Day in an effort to reunite families and neighbors alienated by the war
There is always great suffering when friends and families are fractured and unwilling to forgive
The gospel of Jesus Christ brings the promise of peace and reconciliation with God and with each other
When Peter asked Jesus how often he should forgive a brother who sinned against him , the Lord surprised everyone with His answer of 'seventy times seven'
Then He told an unforgettable story about a servant who had received forgiveness and failed to pass it on
As God freely forgives us, so He requires that we extend what we have received to others
With God's love and power, forgiveness is always possible.
Every year I do something special to celebrate the arrival of spring , I buy ant traps
Those little invaders continually march into our kitchen in search of any crumb left on the floor
They aren't picky; a shard of potato chip, a grain of rice, or even a speck of cheese will do
Although ants may be a nuisance, Solomon praised them for their steadfast work ethic
He pointed out that ants are self-directed
They have no captain, overseer or ruler, yet they are very productive
The ants also keep busy even when it's not immediately necessary, providing supplies in the summer and gathering food in the harvest
By the time winter arrives, they're not worried about what they will eat
Little by little, these hard workers have saved up enough to sustain themselves
We can learn from the ant
When God gives us times of plenty, we can prepare for times when resources may be low
God is the provider of all that we have, including our ability to work
We are to work diligently, be wise stewards of what He has provided, and then rest in the promise of His care
Let's remember Solomon's advice: 'Go to the ant, consider her ways and be wise'
One morning, when I was a young child, I was sitting in the kitchen, watching my mother prepare breakfast
Unexpectedly, the grease in the skillet in which she was frying bacon caught fire
Flames shot into the air and my mother ran to the pantry for some baking soda to throw on the blaze
Help I shouted
And then I added, 'Oh, I wish it was time to pray'
It's time to pray must have been a frequent household expression, and I took it quite literally to mean we could pray only at certain times
The time to pray, of course, is any time, especially when we're in crisis
Fear, worry, anxiety, and care are the most common occasions for prayer
It is when we are desolate, forsaken, and stripped of every human resource that we naturally resort to prayer
We cry out with the words of David, 'Help me, O Lord!'
John Cassian, a 5th-century Christian, wrote of this verse: 'This is the terrified cry of someone who sees the snares of the enemy, the cry of someone besieged day and night and exclaiming that he cannot escape unless his Protector comes to the rescue.'
May this be our simple prayer in every crisis and all day long: 'Help, Lord!'?
In the annals of US advertising history, one of the most efficient slogans ever is the California milk producers' two-word question, 'Got milk?'
With that phrase, the group captured almost everyone's attention
In surveys, the slogan was recognized by more than 90 percent of the people polled
perhaps we can create some two-word slogans to remind ourselves to live more godly lives
Let's turn to James 4 and try it
This passage gives four specific guidelines
1 Give in 
Verse 7 tells us to submit to God
Our sovereign God loves us, so why not let Him run the show
Submission helps us resist the devil
2 Get close
Verse 8 reminds us of the value of drawing near to God
It's up to us to close the gap between us and God
3 Clean up
Verse 8 also reminds us to make sure our hearts are clean
That happens through confessing our sins to God
4 Get down
James says we need to be humble before God
That includes viewing our sin as something to weep over
Give in
Get close
Clean up
Get down
These pairs of words may not look as good on a T-shirt as 'Got milk?'
But they sure will look good on us.
Having played intercollegiate soccer, I've never lost my love for 'The Beautiful Game.'
I especially enjoy watching the English Premier League
One reason is the skill and speed with which the game is played there
Also, I love the way the fans sing in support of their beloved 'sides.'
For instance, Liverpool has for years had You'll Never Walk Alone as its theme
How moving to hear 50,000 fans rise as one to sing the lyrics of that old standard
It's an encouragement to players and fans alike that together they will see each other through to the end
This sentiment has meaning for everyone
Because each of us is made for community, isolation and loneliness are among the most painful of human experiences
During painful times, our faith is vital
The child of God never needs to fear abandonment
Even if people turn on us, friends forsake us, or circumstances separate us from loved ones, we are never alone
God has said, 'I will never leave you nor forsake you'
This is not just a nice tune or clever lyrics offering an empty sentiment
It is the promise of God Himself to those who are the objects of His love
He is there, and He isn't going away
With Christ, you will never walk alone.
Have you ever felt overwhelmed by rules and expectations
Think of how the Jewish people must have felt as they tried to keep up with more than 600 rules from the Old Testament and many more that had been imposed on them by the religious leaders of their day
And imagine their surprise when Jesus simplified the pursuit of righteousness by narrowing the list down to just two love the Lord your God and love your neighbor as yourself
In essence, Jesus is telling us that the way God knows we love Him is by how we treat people
All of them
Let's face it, loving our neighbor can be a challenge
But when we do it to express our love to God, we unleash a powerful motivation that loves whether the person deserves it or not
And as we love God and our neighbor, everything else falls into place
If I love my neighbor, I won't bear false witness against him, covet his wealth or his wife, or steal from him
Loving others for God's sake even provides the grace and strength to forgive those who have heaped injustices upon us
Who needs to see God's love today through you
The more unlovable the person, the greater the statement about how much you love God!
Every year when May rolls around in Michigan, I want to stop the clock
I rejoice when death is defeated by fragile sprouts that refuse to be confined by hardened clay and brittle branches
Over a few weeks, the naked landscape transforms into fully clothed trees adorned by bright, fragrant flowers
I can't get enough of the sights, sounds, and scents of springtime
I want time to stop moving
Also in May, I come to 1 Kings in my Bible reading schedule
When I get to chapter 10, I have the same feeling: I want the story to stop
The nation of Israel has bloomed
Solomon has become king and has built a magnificent dwelling place for God, who moved in with a blaze of glory
Finally united under a righteous king, they are at peace
I love happy endings
But the story doesn't end there
But King Solomon loved many foreign women, and 'his wives turned his heart after other gods
Just as the seasons of the year continue, so do the cycles of life, birth and death, success and failure, sin and confession
Although we have no power to stop the clock while we're enjoying good times, we can rest in God's promise that eventually all bad times will end.
Paul said in Romans 5:20, Where sin abounded, grace abounded much more
But that radical concept opens a theological floodgate
The biblical writer Jude warned that it is possible to 'change the grace of our God into a license for immorality'
Why be good if you know you will be forgiven
Not even an emphasis on repentance erases this danger completely
In Romans 6, Paul spoke directly to the point
Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound
He gave a short, explosive answer: Certainly not
and used an analogy that starkly contrasts death and life
How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?
No Christian resurrected to new life should be pining for sin
Yet wickedness does not always seem to have the stench of death about it
Sin can be downright appealing
Paul recognized this, so he advised: Reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord, and 'Do not let sin reign in your mortal body
If we truly grasped the wonder of God's love for us, we would spend our days trying to fathom and share, not exploit, His grace.
For all of us who, like Job, have suffered through tragedy and then dared to aim our questions at God, chapter 38 of Job's book should give us plenty to think about
Imagine what it must have felt like for the great man of the East when out of the whirlwind he heard God say, Who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge
Now prepare yourself like a man; 
I will question you, and you shall answer Me'
Job must have felt as puny as an ant
As God unveiled His questions in the verses that follow, what He said was as unexpected as it was powerful
Instead, God seemed to be telling him to notice the power and might with which He created this world and to observe His ability to control every element of it
Isn't that reason enough to trust God
Job should have been asking himself
As one example of His awesome power, God pointed to the sky and told Job to observe two of His awe-inspiring creations: Pleiades and Orion
Highlighting His grandeur and man's relative insignificance, God mentioned two constellations that demonstrate power beyond our understanding
This is Someone we can trust
If He has the stars in His hands, surely He can take care of us as well.
Recently, I listened to an audiobook by a militant advocate for atheism
As the author himself read his own work with spiteful sarcasm and contempt, it made me wonder why he was so angry
The Bible tells us that a rejection of God can actually lead to a more hateful attitude toward Him: 'Even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind
[to become] haters of God'
Turning one's back on God does not lead to secular neutrality
Indeed, recent militant atheists have shown their desire to remove any reference to a Creator from culture
When we hear about atheists trying to remove crosses or the Ten Commandments from society, it's easy to respond to their hatred of God with our own hatred
But we're exhorted to defend the truth with an attitude of love, 'in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth'
The next time you see the works or hear the words of a hater of God, do an attitude check
Then ask God for a spirit of humility and pray that the offender might come to the knowledge of the truth.
London's domed St Paul's Cathedral has an interesting architectural phenomenon called the 'whispering gallery.'
One Web site explains it this way: 'The name comes from the fact that a person who whispers facing the wall on one side can be clearly heard on the other, since the sound is carried perfectly around the vast curve of the Dome.'
In other words, you and a friend could sit on opposite sides of architect Sir Christopher Wren's great cathedral and carry on a conversation without having to speak above a whisper
While that may be a fascinating feature of St Paul's Cathedral, it can also be a warning to us
What we say about others in secret can travel just as easily as whispers travel around that gallery
And not only can our gossip travel far and wide, but it often does great harm along the way
Perhaps this is why the Bible frequently challenges us about the ways we use words
The wise King Solomon wrote, 'In the multitude of words sin is not lacking, but he who restrains his lips is wise'
Instead of using whispers and gossip that can cause hurt and pain while serving no good purpose, we would do better to restrain ourselves and practice silence.
Whenever my wife, Martie, and I get ready to go on vacation, we like to read about our destination, study the maps, and anticipate the joy of finally arriving at the place we've dreamed about for so long
For those of us who know Jesus Christ, we have an incredible destination ahead of us heaven
But I find it interesting that a lot of us don't seem to be very excited about getting there
Why is that
Maybe it's because we don't understand heaven
We talk about streets of gold and gates of pearl, but what is it really like
What is there to look forward to
I think the most profound description of heaven is found in Paul's words to the Philippians
He said that to depart and be with Christ is far better
It's what I told my 8-year-old grandson when he asked what heaven is like
I started by asking him, 'What is the most exciting thing in your life?'
He told me about his computer game and other fun things he likes to do, and then I told him that heaven is far better
He thought for a minute, and then said, Papa, that's hard to imagine.
What is it that you look forward to in life
What really excites you
Whatever it is, although it's hard to imagine, heaven will be far better!
Jesus said, 'I am the resurrection and the life'?
It's one thing to make such a bold assertion; it's another to back it up, and back it up Jesus did by rising from the dead
'If you believe that the Son of God died and rose again,'
writes George MacDonald, 'your whole future is full of the dawn of eternal morning, coming up beyond the hills of life, and full of such hope as the highest imagination for the poet has not a glimmer yet.'
The Son of God died and rose again, and His resurrection is the guarantee that God will bring us up and out of the ground: A thinking, feeling, remembering, recognizable person will live forever
Living forever means living out the thought of eternity that God has placed in our hearts; meeting again one's believing loved ones lost through separating death; living in a world without sorrow; seeing our Lord who loves us and gave everything to unite us to Him forever
But I see another meaning
Since we have this life and the next, we don't have to have it all now
We can live in broken and ruined bodies for a time; we can endure poverty and hardship for a while; we can face loneliness, heartache, and pain for a season
Why 
There is a second birth, life in heaven forever.
In the 1980s, John Knoll and his brother Thomas began experimenting with a computer program to manipulate images
Software companies thought they were crazy, because photographers didn't use computers at that time
Initially the brothers called their program Display, then Imaginator, and finally they settled on Photoshop
Today Photoshop is used by amateurs at home and professionals in business around the world
A San Jose Mercury News article noted its place in popular language
When something looks too good to be true, people say, 'It must have been Photoshopped.'
On the first Easter morning, the women who took spices to anoint the body of Jesus found the tomb empty and heard angels say, 'He is not here, but is risen!'
When the women told this to the disciples, 'Their words seemed to them like idle tales, and they did not believe them'
Nonsense
Mind-boggling
If someone manipulated the evidence, then millions of people around the world gather today to celebrate a myth
But if Jesus conquered death, then all He said about forgiveness, power to change, and eternal life is real
Because Christ has risen and lives today, this news is too good not to be true!
Many of America's 30 million white-tailed deer find themselves endangered not by guns, but by the cars of our expanding suburbs
I was reminded of their plight when a mature doe dashed through traffic just ahead of me
As I watched, I wondered what had driven her to take such a chance, and why she then stopped on the other side and looked back over her shoulder
As I drove by her, I turned to follow her gaze and saw two small fawns looking helplessly at their mother across the busy street
Instead of following, they turned and walked back into the woods
This family is not alone
We too can find ourselves in circumstances of separation and danger we did not anticipate
Reading Malachi and Matthew reminds us that we are troubled children of troubled parents who desperately need the help of our Father in heaven
Sometimes we need His help to see and avoid repeating the sins of our fathers
Sometimes we need His help to turn back to the example and care of loving parents
Only from our heavenly Father can we find the perfect forgiveness, example, and inner grace we need
He knows we are all fallen children of fallen parents 
Now He offers us the help of His Spirit and the rescue of His Son.
Sooner or later we all feel the painful effects of sin
Sometimes it's the weight of our own sin and the shame and embarrassment of having failed miserably
At other times, it's the load of someone else's sin that weighs us down, someone who betrayed, deceived, abandoned, ridiculed, cheated, or made a fool of us
Think about a time when the weight of that guilt or pain was so heavy that you couldn't pull yourself out of bed
Now try to imagine the heaviness of the combined grief that everyone's sin has caused your family, your church, your neighborhood
Add to that all the suffering sin has caused everyone in your city, state, nation, and the world
Now try to imagine the accumulated grief that sin has caused throughout the centuries since creation
Is it any wonder that the weight of all this sin began squeezing the life out of Jesus on the night He was called to bear it
The next day, even His beloved Father would forsake Him
No other suffering can compare
Sin put Jesus to the ultimate test
But His love endured it, His strength bore it, and His power overcame it
Thanks to Jesus' death and resurrection, we know beyond a doubt that sin will not and cannot win.
How should we handle moments of faith-failure, when we've damaged the kingdom of God in the eyes of our friends and family or dishonored God in our actions
We can learn from King David after his humiliation in the Bathsheba scandal
Though the terrible consequences of that sin could not be avoided, he found his way back to a relationship with God that made it possible for him to continue to serve Him
We too can find our way back
David's pattern in 2 Samuel 12 serves us well: We need to declare our error candidly and seek God's forgiveness
Then we can ask God that others be spared the consequences of our actions
Finally, we need to recognize that sometimes the consequences simply cannot be avoided and must be endured
While we always mourn those consequences, we can't allow them to so consume us that we cease to be servants of God
Satan not only delights in the moment of our failure but also in the spiritual inactivity that sometimes snares us in our remorse
When we've blown our witness, we are and should be humbled
But we should not multiply the damage by retreating into silence and obscurity as ambassadors of Christ
We can move past failure.
A young man facing the future and unsure of what the next year would bring, concluded, 'Nobody knows what God's will is.'
Is he right
Does a lack of certainty about the future translate into not knowing God's will
The concept of knowing God's will is often limited to discerning what specific situation we will be in at some future time
Although seeking God's specific leading is part of it, another aspect that is just as vital is to follow the clearly defined elements of God's will each and every day
For instance, it is God's will for us to be good citizens as a challenge to those opposed to Christ , to give God thanks no matter what, to be sanctified sexually, avoiding immorality, to live under the Holy Spirit's control, to sing to Him, and to submit to other believers
As we submit to God in these and other areas, we are more likely to live in what Romans 12:2 calls God's 'good and acceptable and perfect will
Living with God's smile of approval leads to His guidance for the future
As we seek to know God's will for the future, we must also act on what we already know now.
November 9, 2010, marked the 21st anniversary of the fall of the Berlin wall
On that day in 1989, an announcement over East German TV informed people that they were free to travel to West Germany
A day later, East German bulldozers began to dismantle the wall that for 28 years had divided East and West Germany
Jesus Christ has broken down the middle wall of separation between Jew and Gentile
But there was an even more impenetrable barrier that separated man from God
Jesus' death and resurrection made the reconciliation between man and man and between man and God possible
All believers are now members of the household of God
Together, we are to grow into a holy temple in the Lord with God's Holy Spirit living among and within us
But sadly, Christians often re-erect walls between one another
That is why Paul urges us to 'walk worthy of the calling
bearing with one another in love, 
endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace
Rather than building walls, let's work to dismantle what separates us
Let the world see that we are indeed of the same household.
When I was growing up, we often sang a song in Sunday school that went like this: 'God is good to me
God is good to me
He holds my hand and helps me stand
God is good to me!'
I need to say right away that I believe God is good and He takes delight in doing good things for people
He does indeed hold our hand in times of trouble and helps us stand against the onslaught of life's difficulties
But I wonder if you've ever asked yourself, Why is He good
It certainly is not because we deserve it or because He feels the need to buy our love and allegiance with His benefits
The psalmist prays for God to bless him so that '[the Lord's] way may be known on earth, Your salvation among all nations'
God's daily blessings are proof positive that He is indeed a good God who cares for His own
But how will our world know this about God if we never praise Him for His goodness to us
So, the next time God blesses you, be sure to look for ways to appropriately give Him the credit
Consuming His blessings without communicating His goodness shortchanges the very purpose of His gifts of grace in our lives.
Imagine standing shoulder to shoulder with onlookers by a dirt road
The woman behind you is on her tiptoes, trying to see who is coming
In the distance, you glimpse a man riding a donkey
As He approaches, people toss their coats onto the road
Suddenly, you hear a tree crack behind you
A man is cutting down palm branches, and people are spreading them out ahead of the donkey
Jesus' followers zealously honored Him as He entered Jerusalem a few days before His crucifixion
The multitude rejoiced and praised God for all the mighty works they had seen
Jesus' devotees surrounded Him, calling out, 'Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!'
Their enthusiastic honor affected the people of Jerusalem
When Jesus finally arrived, 'all the city was moved, saying, '\sWho is this
Today, people are still curious about Jesus
Although we can't pave His way with palm branches or shout praises to Him in person, we can still honor Him
We can discuss His remarkable works, assist people in need , patiently bear insults, and love each other deeply
Then we must be ready to answer the onlookers who ask, Who is Jesus?
During summer training camp, the coaches on one football team wore T-shirts intended to urge their players to exert maximum effort
The shirts bore the motto, Each day you must choose: The pain of discipline or the pain of regret
Discipline is tough, and something we may try to avoid
But in sports and in life, short-term pain is often the only path to long-term gain
In the heat of battle it is too late to prepare
That's the pain of regret
One source defines regret as 'an intelligent and emotional dislike for personal past acts and behaviors.'
It's painful to look back at our choices through the lens of regret and feel the weight of our failures
This was the case for the psalmist
After a personal episode of sin and failure, he wrote, 'Many sorrows shall be to the wicked; but he who trusts in the Lord, mercy shall surround him'
In the clarity of hindsight, he saw the wisdom of a life that strives to honor the Lord, a life that does not need to be marked by regret
May our choices today not result in regret, but rather be wise and God-honoring.
In April 2010, clouds of ash spewed by a volcano in Iceland closed airports across the UK and Europe for 5 days
Nearly 100,000 flights were canceled and millions of passengers around the world found themselves in an enormous holding pattern on the ground
People missed important events, businesses lost money, and no one knew when it would end
When our plans fall apart and there is no remedy, how do we deal with frustration and delay
Isaiah 26:3-4 is an anchor for our souls in every storm of life: 'You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You
Trust in the Lord forever, for in [Jehovah], the Lord, is everlasting strength
Whether we're facing annoying inconvenience or heartbreaking loss, this rock-solid promise is worth memorizing and repeating every night when we close our eyes to sleep
Today, when plans are shattered, do our minds dwell on the circumstances or on the Lord
During frustrating delay, can we still trust the loving heart of God
In the hymn Like a River Glorious,Frances Havergal so beautifully expressed what we long for.
In his book Life After Heart Surgery, David Burke recalls his close brush with death
Lying in his hospital bed after a second open-heart surgery, he found himself in incredible pain, unable to draw a full breath
Feeling that he was slipping toward eternity, he prayed one last time, trusting God and thanking Him for forgiveness of his sin
David was thinking about seeing his dad, who had died several years earlier, when his nurse asked how he was feeling
He replied, I'm okay now, explaining he was ready to go to heaven and meet God
Not on my shift, buddy
she said
Soon the doctors were opening his chest again and removing two liters of fluid
That done, David began to recover
It's not unusual for any of us to ponder what it will be like when we face our final moments on earth
But those who die in the Lord have the certainty that they are blessed and that their death is precious in the sight of the Lord
God fashioned our days even before we existed, and we exist now only because the breath of the Almighty gives [us] life'
Though we don't know how many breaths we have left, we can rest in the knowledge that He does.
Sourdough bread became popular during the California Gold Rush of the mid-1800s
In the 1890s, it was a favorite during the great Gold Rush in Alaska
Prospectors would carry with them a small portion of sourdough mix that contained a natural yeast
It could then be used as a starter to make more of their favorite sourdough bread
In the Bible, though, yeast or leaven can have a negative connotation
For example, in the New Testament, leaven is often referred to as a corrupting influence
This is why Jesus said: Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy
Hypocrites put on a show of righteousness while hiding sinful thoughts and behavior
Christ warned His disciples and us that secret sins will someday be exposed to full disclosure
He said, 'There is nothing covered that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not be known'
Because of this, we are to reverentially fear God, to ask for His grace to forsake any sin, and to grow as authentic believers
Yeast may be a blessing in the bakery, but it can also remind us to guard against the permeating influence of sin in our hearts.
The road was smooth and we were making good progress as we headed for Jay's dad's house in South Carolina
As we drove through the mountains in Tennessee, I began seeing detour signs
But Jay kept going, so I assumed that they didn't apply to us
Shortly before we reached the North Carolina border, we came to a sign that said the highway ahead was closed due to a rock slide
We would have to turn around
Jay was surprised, Why wasn't there any warning
There were lots of warnings, I said
Didn't you see the signs
No, he said, why didn't you mention them
I assumed that you saw them, I answered
We now tell this story to entertain our friends
Throughout history, God provided plenty of signs to show people the way to live, but they kept going their own way
When God finally sent His Son as a sign , the religious leaders paid little attention to His warnings
Life for them was good
They were recognized and respected
They resented being told that they were wrong
We can be the same way
When life is going well, we tend to ignore warnings that we need to turn around and change our sinful ways
It's important to remember that we may be wrong even though life is good.
But some charities are finding that pennies add up to significant sums, and that children are generous givers
As one participant said, Small contributions can make a huge difference.
The Bible account of David and Goliath describes a seemingly insignificant person whose confidence in God was greater than any of the powerful people around him
When David volunteered to face the giant Goliath, King Saul said, You are not able to go against this Philistine
But David had faith in the Lord who had delivered him in the past
If he had listened to the pessimism of Saul or the threats of Goliath, he would have done nothing
Instead, he acted with courage because he trusted God
It's easy to feel like a penny in a trillion-dollar deficit
But when we obey the Lord in every circumstance, it all adds up
Collectively, our acts of faith, large or small, make a big difference
Two young brothers sat on the front row in church every Sunday, observing their dad as he led the worship service
One night after sending the boys to bed, the dad overheard one of his boys crying
He asked him what was wrong, but the boy was hesitant to answer
Finally, he confessed, 'Daddy, the Bible says we're going to worship God in heaven forever
That's an awfully long time
Because he pictured heaven as one long worship time with his dad up front leading, heaven sounded pretty boring to him
While I sometimes wish we had more information about what heaven will be like, we know this for sure: boring can't possibly be the right word to describe it
We will see beauty like we've never seen before, including 'a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal'
We will experience the glory of God, which will illuminate heaven
And we will enjoy a life without pain or sorrow
Yes, we will definitely worship in heaven
People 'out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation will rejoice in praising Jesus, the worthy Lamb who died for us and rose again
We will bask in the glory of the Lord's presence forever
But not for one second will we be bored!
The prophet Isaiah draws a picture for us in Isaiah 46 of the siege of Babylon and the evacuation of its idols
The carts and carriages that carry them creak, and the weary animals groan under the load
In contrast, Isaiah says that God carries His children from birth
Even to your old age, I am He, and even to gray hairs I will carry you, God declares
The contrast is precise and vivid in the Hebrew text: The carts and carriages are loaded with the weight of the idols, but we are loaded upon God
Idols are a burden, a thing carried, but God has gladly carried us from the womb
The Lord has made us
Nothing could be more comforting, for our Father loves and cares for His children
He promises, I will carry you
and that includes every care and worry that comes our way throughout our lifetime
So we may let Him carry us and our every burden
This song by Annie Johnson Flint challenges us to experience God's care: Fear not that thy need shall exceed His provision, 
Our God ever yearns His resources to share
Lean hard on the arm everlasting, availing
Thy Father both thee and thy load will upbear
Of all my childhood memories, one stands out above the others
While I have no idea what my teacher said, I clearly remember telling her to 'shut up.'
She sent me home, so I got up and left my kindergarten class to walk the half-block home
Walking down the sidewalk, I saw my mother weeding in the garden behind our house
I was now faced with a strategic decision, continue on my way and tell my mother why I was home early from school, or turn around and go back to face my teacher
When I returned to the classroom, I was immediately escorted to the restroom where my teacher washed my mouth out with soap
That kind of discipline probably wouldn't happen today
but take it from me, it was effective
To this day I am acutely sensitive about the impact of my words
God is passionately interested in our positive growth as His children
At times He needs to confront us with unpleasant circumstances to catch our attention and reorient our lives to more consistently produce the 'peaceable fruit of righteousness'
Don't resist God's corrective hand
Respond to His reproofs with thankfulness that He loves you enough to care about what kind of a person you are becoming.
Superstars abound in today's culture
Great soccer players can create such excitement that fans have been known to riot in the bleachers
Popular musicians have fans who stand with adoration throughout entire concerts
And Hollywood celebrities hire bodyguards to protect themselves from adoring stalkers
The first-century Corinthian believers had become divided over their own 'spiritual superstars.'
Paul viewed such favoritism as a reflection of the sinful nature in a believer's unyielded heart
For when one says, \sI am of Paul, and another, \sI am of Apollos, are you not carnal he asked
The apostle's teaching on how we view Christian leaders puts the topic in a biblical perspective that provides mutual appreciation for those who minister: I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase
Each person did his part: Paul had planted spiritual seed through evangelism, and Apollos had watered it with his eloquent Bible teaching
But it was God alone who made the seed of spiritual life grow
He alone is the superstar
We should be careful not to put any Christian leader on a pedestal
Instead, let's appreciate how God is using a variety of spiritual leaders for His honor and His glory.
One afternoon Angela gave her young daughter four jellybeans and let her know that was all the candy she was going to receive
After practically inhaling the first three candies, Eliana lingered over the final one
She sucked on it, took it out of her mouth, bit into it, sucked on it some more, then gnawed at the outer shell
Knowing that this was her last jellybean, she took a full 45 minutes to ingest the treat completely
Angela observed her little girl with amusement
It occurred to her that she was watching Eliana learn the value of savoring, enjoying taste and texture and learning to draw out every possible bit of flavor from the pleasurable experience
When we read, 'Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good'
we can be sure that God wants us to savor His presence
He allows us to gain intimate and satisfying knowledge of Him
And when we meditate on His Word, we will draw out a deeper understanding of who He is
As we taste His goodness and love, He will reveal the distinctive flavor of His creativity, sovereignty, holiness, and faithfulness
Our Father must look on with enjoyment as we learn how to enjoy and savor Him.
Felipe Massa of Brazil should have won the Formula One Grand Prix in Singapore in September 2008
But as he drove off from a refueling stop while in the lead, the fuel hose was still attached
By the time his team removed the hose, he had lost so much time that he finished 13th
The apostle Paul warned Timothy of another kind of attachment that would cause him defeat, the affairs of this life
He urged Timothy not to let anything slow him down or distract him from the cause of his Lord and Master
There are many attractive things in our world that are so easy to get entangled with' hobbies, sports, TV, computer games
These may start off as refueling
activities, but later they can take up so much of our time and thought that they interfere with the purpose for which God created us: to share the good news of Christ, serve Him with our gifts, and bring glory to Him
Paul told Timothy why he ought not be entangled with this world's affairs: So that he could 'please Him'
If your desire is to please the Lord Jesus, you will want to stay untangled from the world
As John reminds us, 'The world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever'
Every year I have a physical, that periodic visit to the doctor's office where I'm poked and prodded, screened and studied
It is something that can be easy to dread, and even to fear
We aren't sure what the tests will show or what the doctors will say
Still, we know that we need this evaluation to understand our physical well-being and what is needed as we move forward
The same is true spiritually in the life of the Christ-follower
We need to pause from time to time and reflect on the condition of our hearts and lives
One place for an important self-study is at the Lord's Table
Paul wrote to the Corinthians, some of whom were eating in an unworthy manner: Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup
In the remembrance of Christ's death for us, there can be a sobering clarity of thought and understanding, for as we consider the price Jesus paid for us, it is the best time to consider the condition of our heart and our relationships
Then, with honest understanding of our spiritual well-being, we can turn to Him for the grace we need to move forward in His name
Is it time for your checkup?
One US Army colleague said: 'I have never come across another general officer who was so compassionate and so concerned about the well-being of soldiers and their families.'
After losing one son to suicide and another who was killed in action, Mark and his wife, Carol, dedicated themselves to helping soldiers and their families cope with service-related stress, depression, and loss
In the book of Acts, a follower of Christ was well known for his care and concern toward others
His name was Joseph, but in the early church, the apostles called him Barnabas son of encouragement.
It was Barnabas who vouched for the newly converted Saul when others doubted the sincerity of his faith
Later, Barnabas brought Saul from Tarsus to teach the believers in Antioch
And it was Barnabas who wanted to give John Mark a second chance after his failure on a previous missionary journey
Compassion is an inner feeling resulting in outward action
It should be our daily uniform of service
By God's grace, may we be known for it.
The eaglets were hungry, and Mom and Dad seemed to be ignoring them
The oldest of the three decided to solve his hunger problem by gnawing on a twig
Apparently it wasn't too tasty, because he soon abandoned it
What intrigued me about this little drama, which was being broadcast by webcam from Norfolk Botanical Garden
a big fish lay just behind the eaglets
But they had not yet learned to feed themselves
They still relied on their parents to tear their food in tiny pieces and feed it to them
Within a few weeks, however, the parents will teach the eaglets how to feed themselves, one of their first survival lessons
If the eaglets don't learn this skill, they will never be able to survive on their own
The author of Hebrews spoke of a similar problem in the spiritual realm
Certain people in the church were not growing in spiritual maturity
They had not learned to distinguish between good and bad
Like the eaglet, they hadn't learned the difference between a twig and a fish
They still needed to be fed by someone else when they should have been feeding not only themselves but others as well
While receiving spiritual food from preachers and teachers is good, spiritual growth and survival also depend on knowing how to feed ourselves.
On a teaching trip outside the US, my wife and I were denied entry into our country of destination because of visa problems
Although we were under the assumption our visas had been correctly issued by the country we planned to visit, they were deemed invalid
Despite the efforts of several government officials, nothing could be done
We weren't allowed in
We were placed on the next flight back to the States
No amount of intervention could change the fact that we did not have the proper validation for entrance
That experience with my visa was inconvenient, but it can't begin to compare with the ultimate entry rejection
I'm speaking of those who will stand before God without valid entry into heaven
What if they were to present the record of their religious efforts and good deeds
That would not be enough
What if they were to call character references
That wouldn't work
Only one thing can give anyone entry into heaven
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life
No one comes to the Father except through Me
Christ alone, through His death and resurrection, paid the price for our sins
And only He can give us valid entry into the presence of the Father
Have you put your faith in Jesus
Make sure you have a valid entry into heaven.
Most of us have wanted something so badly that even though we knew it was wrong
Later we have felt sorrow for our spiritual stubbornness and stupidity
In the aftermath of willfully disobeying God, we may become angry with ourselves, numbed by regret, or resigned to the consequences of our foolish mistake
But there is another choice
When the people of Israel insisted on having a king despite the warnings of Samuel the prophet , God allowed them to have their way
But when they realized the tragic results of their choice, they asked for Samuel's help and prayers
Samuel told the people, 'Do not fear
You have done all this wickedness; yet do not turn aside from following the Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart'
We can't undo yesterday, but we can act today to influence tomorrow
Samuel promised to pray for them and teach them the right way
He urged them, Only fear the Lord, and serve Him in truth with all your heart, for consider what great things He has done for you
God invites us to serve Him today, humbly acknowledging His forgiveness and His faithfulness.
John Wayne, famous American actor and film icon, once said, 'Talk low, talk slow, and don't say too much.'
His advice is hard for me to follow since I'm a fast talker and I don't always speak quietly or limit my words
However, this idea of controlling our speech can be a useful tool when dealing with anger
The Bible says we are supposed to be slow to speak, and that 'a soft answer turns away wrath'
Gideon gave a soft answer during a verbal scuffle with some fellow Israelites
Just after his army defeated the Midianites, a group of his countrymen criticized him sharply
They were miffed because they missed out on the main part of the battle
Gideon did not fling back a rough response
Instead, he reminded them that they had captured and killed the Midianite princes
He also honored the men by asking, What was I able to do in comparison with you
Finally, 'their anger toward him subsided when he said that
With the Lord's help, we can defuse heated situations by reining in our words
Responding gently and carefully to angry people can promote unity, for God's glory.
At the 2009 Kansas high school state track championship, an unusual thing happened
The team that won the girls 3,200-meter relay was disqualified
But what happened next was even more unusual
The team that was awarded the state championship by default turned right around and gave their medals to the team that had been disqualified
The first school, St
Mary's Colgan, lost first place because judges ruled that a runner had stepped out of her lane as she handed off the baton
That meant the second team, Maranatha Academy, moved up to first
After receiving their medals, the girls from Maranatha saw the downtrodden looks on the faces of the St
Mary's girls, so they gave them their individual medals
Why did they do this
As Maranatha's coach Bernie Zarda put it: 'Our theme for the year was to run not for our glory, but for God's glory.'
As a result of the girls' action, their story was told throughout Kansas, and God's name was lifted up
When we set aside our own interests and accomplishments to recognize that it's better to care for the interests of others , we see God's name glorified
Acting with grace and kindness toward others is one of the best ways to point people to God.
Some say that theology is only for 'professionals.'
But the situation in the days of the prophet Jeremiah illustrates why it's important for everyone to know what God says about Himself
The religious experts in Jeremiah's day were misrepresenting God by prophesying 'the delusions of their own minds and leading people astray with their lies
Due to their dishonesty, the people did not know the true nature of God
Today there are people who portray God as angry, vengeful, and eager to punish people for every minor offense
God, however, describes Himself as 'merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding in goodness and truth'
Others show the world a picture of a loving God who is too kind to punish wrongdoing
But God describes Himself as one who exercises judgment and righteousness
He is both a just Judge and a loving Father
If we emphasize one over the other, we paint a false picture of God
The most important thing we can know about God and proclaim to the world is that God does not want to punish people; He wants them to repent so that He can forgive
But to be truly loving, He must also be absolutely just.
On one of Christopher Columbus' voyages, he found that his crew's food supply was almost depleted
Anchored off the island of Jamaica, he was grateful to be given food by the islanders
But as time went on, the gifts of food decreased so that the crew began to starve
Columbus knew from an astronomy book that a lunar eclipse would soon occur
He called the native chiefs together and told them God was angry about their selfishness and would blot out the moon
At first the islanders scoffed
But when they watched the night's silver disc slowly become dark, they became terrified and quickly brought food
Columbus said that if he prayed, the moon would be restored
Though we may empathize with his circumstances, message from God was dishonest and self-serving
The apostle Paul wrote, We are not, as so many, peddling the Word of God
At all times we must be on guard not to misrepresent God's message to acquire what we want from others
With a heart yielded to God, we must honestly share spiritual truths that will benefit those who hear.
It's my duty to grill the burgers, brats, steaks, or whatever else my wife has on the menu
And while I'm not the greatest chef when it comes to outdoor cooking, I love the unforgettable aroma of grilling over a charcoal fire
So the mention of a fire of coals in John 21:9 catches my attention
And I find myself wondering why John would include this detail in the story about Jesus calling a failing Peter back to serve and follow Him
In verses 1-3, it's apparent that Peter had reopened his fishing business
Just a few days before, Peter was warming his hands over a charcoal fire when he denied Jesus to save his own skin
So why not go back to fishing
While Peter and his cohorts were casting nets, Jesus built a fire on the beach
Coincidence
I doubt it
And as Peter approached Jesus, I wonder if the pungent aroma of the burning charcoal brought back memories of that other fire where he had failed Christ
Yet Jesus in His mercy took the initiative to call Peter back into His service
Think of it: Jesus is willing to forgive our failures and call us into His service
After all, if only perfect people qualified to serve Him, He wouldn't have anyone to choose from!
Of His words recorded in the Bible, Jesus has more to say on money than any other topic
Luke 12 offers a good summary of His attitude
He does not condemn possessions, but He warns against putting faith in money to secure the future
Money fails to solve life's biggest problems
Although Jesus speaks to many aspects about money, He seems to concentrate on the question: What is money doing to you
Money can dominate a person's life, diverting attention away from God
Jesus challenges us to break free of money's power, even if it means giving it all away
Jesus urges His listeners to seek treasure in the kingdom of God, for such treasure can benefit them in this life and the next one too
Do not worry, He says , for God is the one who provides for our needs
And then to emphasize His point, He brings up King Solomon, the richest man in the Old Testament
Jesus said that a common wildflower is clothed more gloriously by God than a royal king
So do not have an anxious mind , 'but seek the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to you'
Better to trust in the God who lavishes care on the whole earth than to spend our lives worrying about money and possessions.
When I visited Mexico, I wished I knew how to speak Spanish
I could say gracias, muy bien, and hola
But that was about it
I grew tired of just saying gracias to everyone who talked with me or did something for me
But we should never grow tired of giving words of thanks to God
David knew the importance of saying thanks
After he became king over Israel and had a tent constructed to house the ark of the covenant , he appointed some of the Levites 'to commemorate, to thank, and to praise the Lord'
Many people remained there to offer sacrifices and give thanks to God daily
David also committed to Asaph and his associates a song of thanks
His psalm gave thanks for what the Lord had done: 'His deeds among the peoples', 'His wondrous works', 'His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth', and His 'salvation'
David's song also gave praise for who the Lord was: good, merciful, and holy
Like David, we should never grow tired of saying gracias to God for who He is and for all He's done for us
Take time today to offer your sacrifice of praise to Him.
My family and I live in an apartment, so our flower garden consists of what we can grow in indoor pots
For a long time our plants would not flower despite watering and fertilizing
Then we discovered that the soil had to be raked and turned over if the plants were to bloom
Now our potted plants are a pure joy to look at with their healthy leaves and blooming flowers
Sometimes we need a little raking and turning in our own lives to make us bloom
Writing to the harassed believers in his day, Peter said, Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; but rejoice
Like the soil in our potted plants, these Christians were having their lives turned over
God's purpose in doing that was to allow their faith to result in praise and glory to Him at the revelation of Jesus Christ
God wants to loosen the things that can choke our lives and that prevent us from radiating joy
To do this, He sometimes has to allow pain and trouble, trials that help stir up the soil of our lives
If this is what you are experiencing today, rejoice
Surrender to His touch and acquire a joy and fruitfulness you never imagined possible.
During a time of economic crisis and depressing news, two students at Purdue University decided to lift the spirits of people on campus with some encouraging words
For two hours every Wednesday afternoon, Cameron Brown and Brett Westcott stood along a busy walkway holding a large Free Compliments sign and saying nice things to everyone who passed by
I like your red coat
Cool snow boots
Very nice smile
Some students said they deliberately walked past the compliment guys every Wednesday just to hear a kind word
I was struck by these two young men who looked at people with the goal of commending them, rather than finding fault or being critical
Is that how I, as a follower of Christ, view others each day
Instead of being like the person who is focused on evil and whose speech is like a burning fire, we can take a different approach, knowing that what we say begins deep inside us
The heart of the wise teaches his mouth, and adds learning to his lips
Pleasant words are like a honeycomb, sweetness to the soul and health to the bones
Kind words may be free, but they give a priceless lift of spirit
Why not encourage someone today
Not long ago, our friends had a gathering at their house and invited a group of people who were all music lovers
Kevin and Ilse, who are both gifted musicians, requested that each person or couple bring a rock for a fire pit that was often the site for their evening musical jams
But they didn't want just plain ol' rocks
They asked that each one be marked with a name or date or event that indicated how or when everyone had become friends
God felt that the Israelites needed a reminder of an amazing event in their lives
Although the Jordan River had been at flood stage, the Israelites had been able to cross over on dry ground because God had stopped the water from flowing
Something similar had happened years before in an escape from Egypt
On this occasion, however, God instructed His people to build a memorial of stones so that in the future when children would ask about the stones, parents could remind them of the mighty hand of God
As God continually cared for the Israelites, He continues to provide for us today
What stones of remembrance will you use to remind your children, grand children and even yourself of the evidence of God's might?
When I played American football as a kid
One thing that took some getting used to was all the equipment we had to wear
Running effectively in a helmet, shoulder pads, and a variety of other protective items can feel awkward and clumsy at first
But over time the protective gear becomes like a familiar friend that provides welcome protection against serious injury
When a football player suits up, he knows that his equipment is designed to protect him in battle against a dangerous opponent
As followers of Christ, we also face a dangerous foe a spiritual enemy who seeks our downfall and destruction
Fortunately, our Lord has provided us with protection
He challenges us to suit up for spiritual battle
In Ephesians 6:13, we read, 'Take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.'
Paul then describes our armor, helmet, breastplate, shield, sword, belt, and shoes
These pieces of spiritual equipment are effective only if we put them on and use them, even if they might feel uncomfortable at first
Faithfulness in the Word , in prayer , and in witness are critical to making our armor feel like a part of us
So suit up
The battle is on!
I have a friend whose note cards are imprinted with a picture of Rodin's The Thinker, the famous sculpture depicting a man in sober reflection
Below the picture is this inscription: 'Life is not fair.'
Indeed, it is not
And any theory that insists that this life is fair is illusory and deceptive
Despite the overwhelming unfairness of life, however, David in Psalm 37 prays that he will not retaliate but will instead rest in the Lord and wait patiently for Him to bring justice to the earth in due time
For evildoers shall be cut off, but those who wait on the Lord, they shall inherit the earth
Our wrath tends to be vindictive and punitive
God's wrath is untainted by self-interest and tempered by mercy
His wrath can even be His relentless love that brings our antagonists to repentance and faith
We must not then avenge ourselves, for it is written, \sVengeance is Mine
I will repay, says the Lord
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good'
This must begin in the heart, the wellspring from which the issues of our lives flow
May we cease from anger, forsake wrath, and wait patiently for the Lord.
Would you pray for my sister? the burly worker asked awkwardly
I eyed him suspiciously
Months earlier, muggy August heat intensified emotions in the pre-strike atmosphere of the assembly plant where I was working that summer
Managers drove production at a frenzied pace and union members resisted
During breaks, we were coached by union officials on slowing down our output
My faith and idealism got me in the doghouse because I didn't think God would accept anything but my best effort
I naively tried to explain
My co-workers' response was harassment, and this burly worker asking for prayer had been the ring leader
So now I greeted this prayer request with suspicion
His answer jarred me: Because she's got cancer,
he said gruffly, and I need someone God will hear
The bitter rancor between us eased as I prayed for his sister
Like the centurion in Luke 7, people in the storms of life don't waste time or mince words
They go directly to the people whose faith they've tagged as real
We need to be those people
Do our lives mark us as a go-to person in touch with God?
Daniel poured out his heart to God
He had read Jeremiah and rediscovered God's promise that Israel's captivity in Babylon would last 70 years
So, in an effort to represent his people before God, Daniel fasted and prayed
He pleaded with God not to delay in rescuing His people
When we pray, there are things we can know and other things we cannot
For instance, we have the assurance that God will hear our prayer if we know Him as our heavenly Father through faith in Jesus 
We know that His answer will come according to His will
But we don't know when the answer will come or what it will be
For Daniel, the answer to his prayer came in miraculous fashion, and it came immediately
While he was praying, the angel Gabriel arrived to provide the answer
But the nature of the answer was as surprising as the quick reply
While Daniel asked God about 70 years,
the answer was about a prophetic 70 weeks of years.
Daniel asked God for an answer about the here and now, but God's answer had to do with events thousands of years into the future
Focused as we are with our immediate situation, we may be shocked by God's answer
Yet we can know that the answer will be for His glory.
One of my favorite stories is about the Texas rancher who was doing agricultural consulting for a farmer in Germany
He asked the German farmer about the size of his property, to which he replied, 'About a mile square.'
When the German asked the Texan about the size of his ranch, the rancher explained that if he got in his pick-up truck at dawn and drove until sunset he would still be on his ranch
Not to be outdone, the farmer replied, I used to have an old truck like that
All joking aside, it's important to have the right perspective
Unfortunately, the Christians in Laodicea had the wrong perspective about wealth
By all appearances, they were rich
They had plenty of earthly goods and thought they needed nothing, not even Jesus
But Jesus had a different perspective
In spite of their material prosperity, He saw that they were 'wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked'
So He invited them to become truly rich by seeking what only He could provide: purity, character, righteousness, and wisdom
Let's not make the Laodicean mistake
Instead, let's keep our perspective right about what it means to be rich
True wealth is not measured by what you have but by who you are in Christ.
A friend quit two jobs to become a full-time caregiver when his adult son was seriously hurt in a car accident
That same year his wife of over 30 years contracted a terminal illness and died
Since then, he says he has no answers when his son asks why this happened to them
But, he told me of a reassuring dream he had along the way
He dreamed that he was in a place that was awash with sunlight
There were crowds of people around him, and a man was answering all of his why questions
Each answer made so much sense that he clearly understood why he was not to know the answers now
Then he was with his son in the dream
But when he tried to help him with his questions, he couldn't remember the answers
But even that seemed okay
And then he woke up
My friend's experience reminds me of another friend of God who suffered with unanswered questions
Only when God finally broke His silence and gave Job a vision of Himself in the wonder of creation did Job find something that was better than answers
Only then did Job find peace in knowing that our God has good and even wonderful reasons to trust Him.
Many people like both the sweetness and the energy they get from chocolate
Yet British auto technicians have found a surprising use for this sweet food
Scientists at the University of Warwick have built a racecar that runs on vegetable oils and chocolate
The fuel provides energy so that the car can reach top speeds of 135 mph
The Bible also records a surprising source of energy from a food
When Elijah had been used by God on Mt Carmel to call fire down from heaven, this spiritual high was followed by persecution and melancholy
In response to Elijah's depression, God sent an angel to provide food, drink, and rest for the weary prophet
The sustaining power of that food from heaven was remarkable, So he arose, and ate and drank; and he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights as far as Horeb, the mountain of God'
Just as we need food to sustain our physical lives, we also need nourishing food for our spiritual lives
God's Word is sweeter than honey and the honeycomb and feeds our souls
It makes wise the simple and provides both nourishment and energy for life's long journey
Take time to feed on it.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias, one of the world's most powerful telescopes, sits atop an extinct volcano on La Palma, Canary Islands
Inaugurated in July 2009 by King Carlos of Spain, it offers astronomers an unusually clear view of the heavens
Located at 7,870 feet, the telescope is above the cloud cover, where the prevailing winds are dry and turbulence-free
Here, near the equator, scientists can study all of the Northern Celestial Hemisphere and part of the Southern
Jesus chose a mountainside to teach His followers about the characteristics of a life yielded to God
There He taught them that attitude, not altitude, was the key to having a clear view of the Father
Tucked into the passage known as the Beatitudes, Jesus said: 'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God'
This is not just for the few who try to achieve it, but for all who will humbly receive it
To have a heart that is clean in God's eyes, we need to accept the Father's pardon through Christ His Son
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse [purify] us from all unrighteousness'
A mountaintop is a great place to see the stars, but to clearly see God requires a change of heart.
Joyful shouts filtered into our house from outside and I wanted to know what was so wonderful out there
I peeked through the curtains and watched two young boys splashing in a thick stream of water that gushed from a fire hydrant
The overflow reminded me of how God pours out blessings on His children, and how important it is to recognize that the Lord daily loads us with benefits
Although I know He has furnished countless good things for me, when the car blows a gasket, when the flu infects my family, and when relationships threaten to unravel, dissatisfaction threatens my view of God's blessings
they seem more like infrequent drips from a faucet rather than a flood of water from a hydrant
Maybe that's why in Psalm 103 David reminds us to 'forget not all His benefits'
And then, to help us, he lists a torrent of blessings for believers
He reminds us that God forgives all our iniquities, heals all our diseases, redeems our lives from destruction, crowns us with lovingkindness, and satisfies our mouths with good things
Today, let's take time to acknowledge God's abundance instead of overlooking the overflow of His blessings.
I read about a 5-minute rule that a mother had for her children
They had to be ready for school and gather together 5 minutes before it was time to leave each day
They would gather around Mom, and she would pray for each one by name, asking for the Lord's blessing on their day
Then she'd give them a kiss and off they'd run
Even neighborhood kids would be included in the prayer circle if they happened to stop by
One of the children said many years later that she learned from this experience how crucial prayer is to her day
The writer of Psalm 102 knew the importance of prayer
This psalm is labeled, 'A prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed and pours out his complaint before the Lord.'
He cried out, 'Hear my prayer, O Lord
in the day that I call, answer me speedily'
God looks down 'from the height of His sanctuary; from heaven [He views] the earth'
God cares for you and wants to hear from you
Whether you follow the 5-minute rule asking for blessings on the day, or need to spend more time crying out to Him in deep distress, talk to the Lord each day
Your example may have a big impact on your family or someone close to you.
If there is any such thing as a universal question, it may be this: Are we there yet
Generations of children have asked it
They have then grown into adults who have to answer the same question when their children ask
Whenever I read the books of Moses, I wonder how many times he heard that question from the Israelites
Before rescuing them from slavery and leading them out of Egypt, Moses told them that the Lord would lead them to 'a land flowing with milk and honey'
He did, but first they spent 40 years wandering in the wilderness
This was no ordinary wandering, however
They were not lost; they were wandering for a purpose
After 400 years of slavery, the children of Israel needed to have their hearts, souls, and minds reoriented toward God
This was accomplished in the wilderness , but not before an entire generation died because of their disobedience
In life, it sometimes seems as if we are wandering in circles
We feel lost
We want to ask God, 'Are we there yet
How much longer?'
At such times, it helps to remember that the journey, not just the destination, is important to God
He uses it to humble us, test us, and show us what is in our hearts.
Skeptical about the usefulness of a small lunch, Andrew said to Jesus, 'What are [these five loaves and two fish] among so many?'
Yet the little lunch in the hands of Jesus turned out to be a huge blessing
So, before you think that you don't have much to offer Jesus, consider this: Edward Kimball, a Sunday school teacher in Boston, decided to visit a young man in his class to be sure he was a Christian
That day he led that man, Dwight L Moody, to the Lord
Chapman, a prominent evangelist, recruited Billy Sunday to join in his evangelistic campaigns
In turn, Sunday launched a national ministry that had great results in cities like Charlotte, North Carolina
An organization that started as a result of Sunday's revival invited evangelist Mordecai Ham to Charlotte
In one of those meetings, Billy Graham received Christ as his Savior and later became the most prominent evangelist of our time
When you think you don't have much to offer, remember Sunday school teacher Edward Kimball, who spent a Saturday afternoon reaching out to someone in his class
God has a special way of using routine faithfulness in the small things to accomplish great things!
I was fishing a local trout stream last summer, when my attention was fixed on a fish that was feeding nearby
I looked up and there on the bank I spied an acquaintance Dave Tucker
Immediately I became aware of my own performance
So it is when we turn our attention away from the activity at hand and think about ourselves
WH Auden has an engaging little poem about those who forget themselves in an activity a cook mixing a sauce, a surgeon making an incision, a clerk completing a bill of lading
He says that all 'wear the same rapt expression, forgetting themselves in a function.'
That phrase forgetting themselves in a function brings Philippians 2:3-4 to mind: 'Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself
Let each of you look out for the interests of others.
When I'm listening to a friend, I need to remind myself to focus on him, not to begin wondering how I look, what he thinks of me, what I should say next
Let's put others first by listening in rapt attention, concentrating on the one in front of us, forgetting ourselves.
In this age of new video technology, it might be hard to believe that some teachers still feel the best way to depict Bible stories is the low-tech flannelgraph board
I recall that my childhood Sunday school teachers used those flat boards covered with flannel, which enabled them to display cutouts of David, Daniel, Jonah, Jesus, and all the other characters
The flannelgraphs helped my teachers capture the essence of the Bible story in an artistic way
Those old-school flannelgraphs aren't the oldest graphic teaching devices, however
God has long had a kind of flannelgraph of His own, and it is called creation
God uses the marvel of creation to instruct us and to display His power
In Psalm 19:1, David wrote, 'The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His handiwork.'
In creation, God has revealed Himself so clearly that Paul declared, 'His invisible attributes are clearly seen.'
Those who have the witness of creation are 'without excuse'
Why on the flannelgraph of God's creation, we see God's order and design
We see His power and glory
This should lead us to worship
'O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth!'
John, the great apostle and the one Jesus loved, was reduced to tears
In a vision he received while imprisoned he found himself in God's throne room as future events unfolded
In heaven, John saw God hold up a sealed scroll
He wept because as he observed the glories of God's presence, he saw no one who could open the scroll, no one with the power to reveal God's final revelation and to complete the concluding chapter of history's drama
As an apostle, John had observed the power of sin in the world
He had witnessed Jesus' life and death on earth to conquer sin
He had seen Him ascend into heaven
But now he was fearful when he saw that no one was worthy to open the scroll and vanquish sin forever
Imagine the drama of what happened next
An elder approached John and said, 'Do not weep,'
and pointed him toward Someone he knew: 'Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah'
John looked, and he saw Jesus, the only One with the power to take the scroll, open the seals, and complete the story
Soon John's tears were dry, and millions of angels were proclaiming, 'Worthy is the Lamb!'
Are you crying
Behold, John's friend, Jesus
He is worthy
Turn things over to Him.
At the beginning of March, my friend began a countdown
Marked on the calendar in her office were the 20 days left until the first day of spring
One morning when I saw her, she volunteered, 'Only 12 more days!'
A few days later, Only 6
Her enthusiasm started to rub off on me, and I began to keep track as well
Just 2 more days, Jerrie
I know
she beamed
As believers, we have something to look forward to that is even more exciting than the anticipation of budding flowers and lots of sunshine after a long winter
God has made many promises in His Word, and each one has been or will be fulfilled
But the certainty that Christ will return is one of the greatest promises of all
For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God
Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
and we'll be with Him forever
Although no one can know the exact day, we have God's promise that Jesus will come back
As we celebrate the spring and coming Easter season, let's encourage each other in anticipation of that day!
Whenever I read the Gospels, I identify with the disciples
Like me, they seemed slow to catch on
Jesus kept saying things like 'Don't you understand it yet?'
and Are you still so dull
Finally, however, Peter got it, at least one part of it
When Jesus asked, Who do you say that I am
Peter answered, You are the Christ
Peter was right about the who Jesus but he was still wrong about the how
When Jesus predicted His death, Peter rebuked Him for it
Jesus, in turn, rebuked Peter, Get behind Me, Satan for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men
Peter was still thinking in human ways of establishing kingdoms
One ruler would overthrow another and set up a new government
He was expecting Jesus to do the same
But Christ's kingdom was going to come in a new way through service and the sacrifice of His life
The method God uses today hasn't changed
Whereas Satan's voice tempts us to gain power, the voice of Jesus tells us that the meek will inherit the earth
To gain citizens for God's kingdom, we must follow the example of Jesus, who set aside selfish ambitions, served others, and called people to repent of their sin.
A major US newspaper has called Christopher Parkening 'the leading guitar virtuoso of our day, combining profound musical insight with complete technical mastery of his instrument.'
There was a time, however, when Parkening gave up playing the guitar professionally
At the height of his career as a classical guitarist, he retired at age 30, bought a ranch in Montana, and spent his days fly-fishing
But early retirement did not bring him the satisfaction he had hoped for
Then during a visit to California, he was invited to a church where he heard a clear presentation of the gospel
Of this he wrote, That night I lay awake, broken over my sins
I had lived very selfishly and it had not made me happy
It was then that I asked Jesus Christ to come into my life, to be my Lord and Savior
For the first time, I remember telling Him, Whatever You want me to do with my life, Lord, I'll do it
One of Parkening's favorite verses is 1 Corinthians 10:31, Therefore, whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
He has taken up the guitar again, but this time with the motivation to glorify God
Each of us has been given gifts; and when we use them for God's glory, they bring satisfaction and joy.
During the 2009 college football season, University of Texas quarterback Colt McCoy began every post-game interview by thanking God for the opportunity to play
When he was injured early in the national championship game, he was forced to watch from the sidelines as his team lost
The apostle Paul experienced God's deliverance many times, but he didn't insist on things going his way
From prison in Rome he wrote to Timothy: 'I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure is at hand'
Some might say that Paul had failed to accomplish his goals and that his life was ending in defeat
But he saw it differently: 'I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith'
He looked forward to an eternal crown
As we walk with God, we can praise Him for His faithfulness, win or lose.
One of my favorite television cartoons as a boy was Tom Terrific
When Tom faced a challenge, he would put on his thinking cap and work through the matter with his faithful sidekick Mighty Manfred, the Wonder Dog
Usually, those problems found their source in Tom's arch-enemy, Crabby Appleton
To this day, I remember how this villain was described on the show
He was 'Crabby Appleton, rotten to the core.'
The fact is that all of us share Crabby Appleton's primary problem, apart from Christ, we're all rotten to the core
The apostle Paul described us this way: 'There is none righteous, no, not one
There is none who understands; there is none who seeks after God'
None of us are capable of living up to God's perfect standard of holiness
Because of our condition of being separated from a holy God, He sent His Son Jesus to give Himself to die on the cross for the punishment we deserve, and then rise again
Now we can be justified freely by His grace through faith in Him
Jesus Christ has come to people rotten to the core, and makes us a new creation by faith in Him
In His goodness, He has fixed our problem completely, all the way down to our core.
Corrie ten Boom was a World War II concentration camp survivor and Christian who became a popular speaker around the world
Thousands attended her meetings as she talked about how she had learned to forgive her captors just as Christ had forgiven her sins
After each meeting, people surrounded her and heaped accolades on her for her godly qualities and thanked her for encouraging them in their walk with the Lord
Corrie said she would then return to her hotel room, get down on her knees, and present those compliments in thanks to God
She called it giving God a bouquet of praise
The Lord has given each of us gifts to use to minister to one another so that 'in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ
To whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever
We have nothing to offer others that we have not first received from the Lord
So the glory does belong to Him
To learn humility, perhaps we could follow Corrie's example
If we receive a compliment for something we've said or done, let's privately give a bouquet of praise to God for the glory He alone deserves.
Sixteen Tons written by Merle Travis and recorded by Tennessee Ernie Ford, became one of America's most popular songs in the mid-1950s
People seemed to identify with this coal miner's lament about feeling trapped and unable to change his situation no matter how hard he worked
Coal miners often lived in company-owned houses and were paid in scrip coupons valid only at the company-owned store
Even if summoned to heaven, the miner said, he couldn't go because he owed his soul to the company store
That sense of hopeless resignation may help us understand the feelings of the Hebrew people during their 400 years of bondage in Egypt
When Moses told them of God's promise to release them from slavery, they didn't listen to him 'because of anguish of spirit
They were so far down they couldn't look up
But God did something for them that they could not do for themselves
The Lord's miraculous deliverance of His people foreshadowed His powerful intervention on our behalf through His Son Jesus Christ
It was when we were powerless to help ourselves that Christ died for sinful men
When life is at its lowest ebb, we are not without hope because of the wonderful grace of God.
The psalmist had seen great and severe troubles
Yet hovering in the back of his mind was the thought that God would revive him again
The literal meaning of this phrase is bring him to life again
You shall increase my greatness and comfort me on every side
If the troubles didn't end in this life, certainly in heaven they would
Perhaps no one but God knows the trouble you've seen, but this is not all that shall be
There will be comfort on every side
His presence and love will bring perfect peace and rest
Richard Baxter writes, 'O what a blessed day that will be when I shall
stand on the shore and look back on the raging seas I have safely passed; when I shall review my pains and sorrows, my fears and tears, and possess the glory which was the end of all!'?
Several years ago a friend of mine visited an exhibit of relics from the infamous Titanic voyage
Exhibit visitors were given a replica ticket with the name of an actual passenger or crew member who, decades earlier, had embarked on the trip of a lifetime
After the tour group walked through the exhibit viewing pieces of silver dinnerware and other artifacts, the tour ended with an unforgettable twist
A large board listed the names of all the passengers, including their status, first class, second class, crew
As my friend looked for the name of the person whose ticket he was holding, he noticed a line across the board dividing the names
Above the line were the names of those who were saved and below the line all those who were lost
The parallel to our life on earth is profound
It really doesn't make any difference how the world ranks your status
The only thing that ultimately matters is whether you are saved or lost
As Jesus said, 'What profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?'
Perhaps you've already trusted in Christ for your salvation
But what about your fellow passengers
Instead of sizing them up by the externals, talk to them about their ultimate destination.
Have you ever stopped to consider the amazing features God placed in the animals He created
Job did, and one of the most interesting he wrote about is the ostrich
Despite its apparent lack of good sense and its eccentric parenting skills, its offspring survive
And despite its membership in the bird family, it can't fly, but it can outrun a horse
Another remarkable creature is the bombardier beetle
This African insect shoots two common materials, hydrogen peroxide and hydroquinone, from twin storage tanks in its back
Apart, these substances are harmless; together, they blind the beetle's predators
A special nozzle inside the beetle mixes the chemicals, enabling it to bombard its foe at amazing speeds
And the little guy can rotate his cannon to fire in any direction
How can this be
How is it that a rather dull-witted ostrich survives despite a seeming inability to care for its young while the bombardier beetle needs a sophisticated chemical reaction to ensure its continued presence on earth
It's because God's creative abilities know no boundaries
The psalmist tells us, He commanded and they were created
From the ostrich to the beetle, God's creative work is clear for all to see
Praise the name of the Lord
I first met my wife, Marlene, in college
I was majoring in pastoral studies, and she was working on a degree in elementary education
The first time I saw her working with children, I knew what a natural fit this was for her
She loved children
It became even more obvious when we got married and had children of our own
Seeing her with them was an education in unconditional love and acceptance
It was clear to me that there is nothing in all the world like the tender love and compassion of a mother for her newborn child
That's what makes Isaiah 49:15 so remarkable
It's here that God told His people, who were feeling forsaken and forgotten , that His compassion is even greater than a mother's: Can a woman forget her nursing child, and not have compassion on the son of her womb
Surely they may forget, yet I will not forget you
Sometimes we face struggles in life, and we are tempted to think that God has forgotten us
We may even believe that God no longer loves us
But God's love for us is as expansive as the open arms of Christ on the cross
And the tender compassion of our heavenly Father is more dependable and more enduring than the love of a nursing mother for her infant
Be comforted, His love never fails.
In May 1884, two young parents disagreed about what middle name to give their newborn son
The mom preferred Solomon; the dad, Shippe, both family names
Because John and Martha couldn't agree, they compromised on 'S.'
Thus Harry S Truman would become the only US president with an initial for a middle name
Over 120 years later, we still know about this conflict, but we also know that a reasonable resolution was reached
In the New Testament, we read about another disagreement that has lived on in history between two missionaries: Paul and Barnabas
Barnabas wanted to take Mark with them on a trip to check on some churches they had helped previously
But Paul did not trust Mark because of an earlier incident
Paul and Barnabas disagreed so sharply that they parted ways
We still read about this argument 2,000 years later
What's important is not that it lived on in history, but that it didn't leave permanent relationship scars
Paul apparently reconciled with Barnabas, and in his final days asked for Mark to be with him because 'he is useful to me for ministry'
Arguments happen
But let's make sure they are resolved
Grudges are a burden too heavy to carry.
I used to view the worship service '\sin church as a time for entertainment
Speaking of folks like me, Sören Kierkegaard said that we tend to think of church as a kind of theater: We sit in the audience, attentively watching the actors onstage
If sufficiently entertained, we show our gratitude with applause
Church, though, should be the opposite of the theater
God is the audience for our worship
What matters most takes place within the hearts of the congregation, not onstage
We should leave a worship service asking ourselves not What did I get out of it? but rather 'Was God pleased with what happened
God took pains to specify details of animal sacrifice for the ancient Israelites in their worship
Yet He said that He didn't need their animals: 'I will not take a bull from your house, nor goats out of your folds, for every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills'
What He wanted was their praise and obedience
By focusing on the externals of worship, we too miss the point: The Lord is interested in a sacrifice of the heart, an internal attitude of submission and thanksgiving
The goal of worship is nothing less than to meet and please our God.
Not long ago, my wife, Janet, and I accepted an invitation to dine with a Christian woman who attends our Sunday school class
In her zeal to prepare a meal for us, she cut her index finger deeply
As we drove her to the emergency room, we prayed for her, and then we kept her company in the waiting room
Several hours later, our friend finally saw the doctor
After we returned to her home, our hostess insisted we stay for the meal she had prepared
What followed was a great time of lively conversation and spiritual fellowship
While we ate, she shared with us some of the heartaches she had suffered, and how through the ups and downs she had found God's wonderful grace invading her life
Later, my wife and I reflected on the unexpected trip to the hospital and the shared fellowship that had resulted
This verse came to mind: 'Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ'
By providing support for our injured hostess, she was blessed
Then afterward, she became a blessing to us through her hospitality and a delicious meal
In retrospect, painful experiences can be a marvelous gateway to rich fellowship as we 'bear one another's burdens.
I've received a lot of good advice in my life
Near the top of the list is this wise observation from a friend: 'Life is not made by the dreams that you dream but by the choices that you make.'
He's right your life today is the sum total of all the choices you've made up to this point
The apostle Paul gave similar advice in Philippians 1:10, when he said to 'approve the things that are excellent'
In any given situation, we have a whole continuum of choices, ranging from really rotten choices, to the mediocrity of average choices, to choices that are good, and then to those that are excellent
God wants to move us across the continuum, past our natural impulses, all the way to excellent choices
Often it's challenging to make the most excellent choice, especially if there aren't many others joining us
Sometimes it may feel as if our desires and freedoms have been suppressed
But if you follow Paul's advice, you'll notice some really positive outcomes, like being pure and blameless and fruitful
Make the choice to live a life filled with love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control
Then revel in the result!
Medical studies have shown that even though people who have had heart-bypass surgery are told that they must change their lifestyle or die, about 90 percent do not change
Typically, 2 years after surgery the patients haven't altered their lifestyle
It seems that most would rather die than change
Just as doctors preach a physical message of change to prevent death, John the Baptist came preaching a spiritual message of change
Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!
He was preparing the way for the ultimate manifestation of God's reign, the Messiah, Jesus
Repentance means to change one's mind and attitude about God, which ultimately changes a person's actions and decisions
Those who repent and accept Christ's provision of forgiveness from their sins through His death on the cross will escape spiritual death
Repentance involves confessing sin with godly sorrow, and then forsaking sin
John the Baptist was calling people to turn from one way of living to ways that honor God
Today, the Lord is still calling us to repent and then to respond with the 'fruits worthy of repentance'
Growing up in rural Missouri where American outlaw Jesse James had lived, my friends and I were convinced he had buried treasure nearby
We wandered the woods in dreamy hopes of digging up a saddlebag or other treasure
Often we'd run into an elderly man chopping firewood with a giant axe
For years, we watched this mysterious 'axe man'
trudge the highways in search of soda cans, his own kind of treasure
Redeeming the cans for cash, he'd retire to his run-down, roofless, unpainted shack with a bottle in a brown paper bag
After his death, his family found bundles of money stored in his ramshackle home
Like the axe man who ignored his treasure, we Christians sometimes ignore parts of Scripture
We forget that all of Scripture is ours to use; that each passage has a reason for its inclusion in the canon
Who knew Leviticus held so much buried treasure
In an efficient seven verses in chapter 19, God teaches us how to provide for the poor and disabled without stripping them of their dignity , how to run our businesses ethically , and how to embed respect for Him into our daily life
If a few verses can contain so much treasure, think of all that can be ours if we dig into our Bibles every day.
Why is it taking my hair so long to get dry
I wondered
As usual, I was in a hurry, and I didn't want to go outside into the wintry weather with wet hair
Then I realized the problem
I often wish I could control the conditions of life as easily as I can change the setting on my hairdryer
I would choose a comfortable setting not too hot, not too cold
I certainly wouldn't choose the heat of adversity or the fire of affliction
But in the spiritual realm, warm doesn't get the job done
We are called to holiness, and holiness often involves 'heat.'
To be holy means to be set apart for God, separated from anything unclean or impure
To refine and purify us, God sometimes uses the furnace of affliction
The prophet Isaiah said, When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned; he didn't say if
And the apostle Peter said that we should not be surprised by trials
None of us knows when we'll be called to walk through the fire or how hot the furnace will be
But we do know this: God's purpose for the flames is to purify us, not to destroy us.
The social networking Web site Facebook.com was launched in 2004 as a way for college students to connect with each other online
It is now open to people of all ages, and currently there are an estimated 500 million users
Each user has an individual page with photos and personal details that can be viewed by 'friends.'
To friend a person means opening the door to communication and information about who you are, where you go, and what you do
Facebook friendships may be casual or committed, but each one is 'by invitation only.'
Just before Jesus was crucified, He told His disciples: 'You are My friends if you do whatever I command you
No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you'
Unselfishness, oneness of purpose, and confident trust are the hallmarks of true friendship, especially in our relationship with the Lord
Christ has taken the initiative by giving His life for us and inviting us to know and follow Him
Have we responded to the Lord Jesus' invitation of friendship by opening our hearts to Him with nothing held back?
Be still, and know that I am God
I will be exalted among the nations
These words from a song sung long ago at the temple in Jerusalem remind us of one of our main tasks worshiping our awesome God
One way to do that is to meditate on His many attributes
Exalt God, for He is faithful, eternal, all-knowing, just, unchangeable, gracious, holy, merciful, longsuffering, impartial, and infinite
Our God is perfect
Exalt God also by realizing that He is all-powerful, almighty, personal, righteous, unsearchable, wise, triune, accessible, self-existent, glorious, and compassionate
Another way to worship God is to contemplate His names
Exalt God, for He is Creator
He is Love
He is Redeemer
He is Shepherd
He is Savior, Lord, and Father
He is Judge
He is Comforter
He is Teacher
He is I AM
Our God is the Mighty One
Dwell on His identity
God is our shield
Our stronghold
Our light
Our strength
Our sustainer
Our rescuer
Our fortress
Meditate on God's attributes
Contemplate His names
Dwell on His identity
Adore Him
Respect Him
Honor Him
Love Him
Exalt Him
Use the rest of your life getting ready to worship our awesome God forever.
It erupts
It melts everything in its path
Its blast is as powerful as a nuclear explosion
Well, maybe not, but a temper can feel as intense as a volcano when it is aimed directly at another person in a family
The moment may be quickly over, but it can leave emotional devastation and bitter feelings behind
It's sad that the people we love the most are often the target of our hurtful words
But even when we feel we've been provoked, we have a choice
Will we respond in anger or in kindness
The Bible tells us to rid ourselves of bitterness and anger, and to 'be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you'
If you are struggling with chronic anger that is hurting your relationships, surrender this vulnerable part of your emotions to Christ's strength
Ask God to forgive you for an uncontrolled temper and to show you how to moderate your emotions and to teach you how to honor others above yourself
Seek out help from others to learn how to deal with your strong emotions in appropriate ways
As we earnestly seek to love others and to please God, we can win the victory over a volcanic temper.
Jim was sharing the gospel with Kerri
He told her she was separated from a holy God because of her sin, and that Jesus had died and risen for her salvation
She kept coming up with one reason not to believe
But if I do receive Him, I won't have to tell other people about it
I don't want to do that
She said that didn't fit her personality; she didn't want to have to tell others about Jesus
Jim explained that promising to witness about Jesus wasn't a requirement before receiving Him
But he also said that once she came to know the Lord, Kerri would become His ambassador to the world
After talking a little longer, Kerri acknowledged her need for salvation through Christ
She went home excited and at peace
Funny thing happened within 24 hours she told three people about what God had done in her life
When we're thankful, we want to share what God has done.
Susan Boyle spent most of her adult life living with her cat Pebbles, caring for her aging mother, and singing in church
She certainly didn't look like a musical superstar
That's probably why the audience laughed at this unassuming middle-aged woman before she performed in a talent show
Undeterred, Susan faced the unfriendly crowd, sang beautifully, and went on to receive a standing ovation
Stephen was confronted by a hostile crowd in the days of the early church
A panel of religious authorities listened to lying witnesses accuse him of blasphemy
Stephen responded by speaking the truth of God's Word, which reinforced his faith in Christ
At the end of his speech, he said, Look I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God
Then the crowd stoned him
Jesus who was watching from heaven, welcomed Stephen home
Most Christians aren't confronted with this much hostility
Yet we all need to stand fast in the Lord when the pressure is on
We can't let others silence our voice for Christ
Speaking up for Jesus does not always win the crowd's favor here on earth, but it does ensure His approval in heaven, where it matters the most.
Golda Meir knew both struggle and success during her life
As prime minister of Israel, she experienced many episodes of conflict and loss, as well as the periodic joy of successes and victory in the life of the fledgling State of Israel
She said of joy and sorrow, Those who don't know how to weep with their whole heart, don't know how to laugh either
The apostle Paul called us to a life of both weeping and rejoicing but with a twist
In Romans 12:15, the apostle challenged us to look outside our own experiences to the needs of others
He said, 'Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.'
If we rejoice only in our own victories, we miss the wonder of celebrating the power of the Lord, who desires to accomplish His purposes in and through others as well
If we mourn only our own losses, we lose the opportunity to be there for those who are hurting by showing them compassion
Life is filled with the extremes of joy and sorrow, victory and defeat
But we have been given the privilege of entering into those moments in people's lives to see the grace of God at work
Don't miss it!
Many of the first astronauts were once Boy Scouts
The scouts were good at capturing the imagination of young boys and instilling discipline to reach their goals even if it meant reaching for the stars
On July 20, 1969, the Boy Scouts were busy celebrating at a conference
During the gathering, the scouts were delighted to hear from former Eagle Scout Neil Armstrong, who sent them greetings from space
One of their own had grown up to realize a wonderful dream
In some ways, the Christian home can be like a loving, spiritual scout camp
The Bible encourages parents to provide a positive growth environment for children in the home
Parents are exhorted to 'bring [children] up in the training and admonition of the Lord
Let's strive to make our home a place where loving discipline enables the children in our charge to reach their potential for God's glory.
When our granddaughter Julia was very small, we took her on a driving trip over an Idaho mountain road
Afterward, she and her Nana were having a conversation about the adventure
I don't worry because I think Papa has a guardian angel
I think he must have a team of guardian angels, Julia replied
The mission of angels is to protect and serve the children of God
The psalmist said, The chariots of God are
thousands of thousands; the Lord is among them
God is the Lord of hosts, which means armies
The angels are the Lord's army
In 2 Kings we read about Elisha and his servant who were surrounded by the Syrian army
Elisha's servant cried out, Alas, my master
What shall we do
Elisha replied, Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.'
Then the Lord opened the servant's eyes and he saw that 'the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around
The Lord's army was at hand
Even though we cannot see them with our natural eyes, we can rest in the confidence that the Lord of Hosts is constantly watching over us and He has an invisible army at His bidding to send where He pleases.
A Washington Post article reported that recent studies into the nature of prejudice found that almost everyone harbors biases, and these attitudes affect even those who actively resist them
A University of Kentucky psychologist says that much of our self-esteem comes from feeling better about ourselves than about others because of the group we belong to
Prejudice is not easy to overcome, even within the family of God
Paul's words to the believers at Colosse instruct us today, saying that our speech and behavior toward fellow Christians should reflect our oneness in Christ
[You] have put on the new man, Paul said, where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free, but Christ is all and in all
Instead of superiority and favoritism, we should demonstrate compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience toward each other
And above all, we are to 'put on love, which is the bond of perfection'
In the body of Christ, no race, nationality, or class is better than another
Through the cross, Christ has made us one, and we are to treat each other with honesty, dignity, and love.
In 1931, the city of Hayward, California, built its first permanent city hall building
Costing $100,000 at the time, the structure with its square Corinthian columns and Roman arch entry was considered a marvel
There was only one problem
It was built on the Hayward Fault and is gradually splitting in two
In 1989, an earthquake forced its closure, and it is now off limits to occupants
Building on an unstable foundation is not wise
This is also true of our spiritual lives
Jesus taught His disciples this truth with an illustration: Everyone who hears these sayings of Mine, and does not do them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand
and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, and it fell and great was its fall
The shifting morals of our present world can be confusing
We may be tempted to let culture or the opinions of society be the foundation for the decisions we make
But obeying the unwavering truth of God's Word brings stability unavailable anywhere else
Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock'
My friend Tim Davis tells the story of being in Trinidad as a little boy when Queen Elizabeth came to visit their town
He recalls going with his missionary parents to join hundreds of others who gathered to greet the queen
Waving his little flag, he watched as the entourage came down the street, first the soldiers, then the mounted guard, and then the limousine from which she waved to the cheering crowd
He looked on as the queen drove out of town, leaving everyone to return to life as usual
In Tim's words, Royalty came to town and nothing changed
For those of us who have accepted Jesus as Savior, there was a day when royalty arrived, in our heart
As Paul put it, our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit a reality that has huge ramifications
His residence in our life is intended to transform us to live in a way that brings glory to Him
Our relationships, the way we serve our employer, how we use our money, how we treat our enemies, and everything else in our lives should reflect the wonderful reality that royalty lives within
Has anything changed since King Jesus came into your heart
Does your world notice or do they think He was just passing through?
In Singapore, the Chinese New Year season's social and business dinners often begin with a dish consisting of salads, dressings, pickles, and raw fish
The name of the dish, Yu Sheng, is a pun that sounds like 'year of prosperity.'
It is traditional for those present to toss the salad together
As they do, certain phrases are repeated to bring about good fortune
Our words may express our hopes for others for the year ahead, but they can't bring about good fortune
The important issue is, what does God want to see in us in the coming year
In his letter to the Philippians, Paul expressed his desire and prayer that their love 'may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment'
The church had been a great tower of support for him , yet he urged them to continue to grow to love others
Paul wasn't talking about intellectual knowledge but knowledge of God
Love for others starts with a closer relationship with Him
With a fuller knowledge of God, we can then discern between right and wrong
Giving our best wishes to others for the coming year is fine
But our heartfelt prayer should be that we abound in love, so that we may be filled with the fruits of righteousness
to the glory and praise of God
Every so often my computer becomes sluggish
Frequent use of certain programs and documents causes pieces of information to become scattered, requiring my computer to search for the pieces before I can use them
To fix it, I need to run a program that retrieves the pieces and groups them together where they are easily accessible
This process is called defragmentation
Like my computer, my life gets fragmented
One situation tugs on my emotions while I'm trying to concentrate on something else
Demands from every direction bombard me
I want to accomplish everything that needs to be done, but my mind won't stop and my body won't start
Soon I begin to feel weary and useless
Recently I attended a retreat where one of the handouts included a prayer with words that expressed how I felt: 'Lord, I am scattered, restless, and only half here.'
King David also went through such times
In prayer, David presented his needs to God morning, noon, and evening, confident that he would be heard
Prayer can help to defragment our lives
When we cast our cares on the Lord, He will show us what we need to do and what only He can do.
True stories about deceit and deception can sound stranger than fiction
According to an AP news item, a Georgia woman was arrested after trying to pay for more than $1,500 in purchases with a million-dollar counterfeit bill
When questioned, the embarrassed patron claimed to have been misled, saying that the fake money had been given to her by her ex-husband, who was a coin collector
The size of the bill makes us question whether anyone could really have been misled into thinking it was real
But maybe that makes it a good illustration of the almost unbelievable problem of self-deception that the prophet warns us about
When Jeremiah said, The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it
he expresses a sense of amazement that is beyond our ability to grasp
Here the prophet is not saying that some of us have a problem being honest with ourselves; he is claiming that everyone does
Thankfully, God searches our hearts and understands what we cannot see
He gives us every reason to say, 'Lord, we need Your help
Please show us whether we are being honest with ourselves and You
If we aren't, help us to change and rely on You rather than on ourselves.'?
In the hectic downtown of one of Asia's great cities, I marveled at the busy sidewalks filled with people
There seemed to be no room to move in the crush of humanity, yet it also seemed that everyone was moving at top speed
My attention was drawn to the soft, almost mournful sound of a single trumpeter playing 'Amazing Grace.'
The crowds appeared oblivious to both the musician and the music
Still, he played, sending a musical message of the love of God out to whoever knew the song and would think about the words as he played
I thought of this experience as a parable
The music seemed to be an invitation to the masses to follow Christ
As with the gospel message, some believe in God's amazing grace and choose the narrow way
Others ignore His grace, which is the broad way that leads to everlasting destruction
Jesus said, 'Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it'
Jesus died so that whoever calls on His name can find forgiveness in His grace.
As an umpire stood behind the plate at a girls' softball game, he heard a player's mother start chanting: We want a new ump
We want a new ump
Soon, other parents took up the chant
The ump smiled, then turned toward the crowd and yelled, I want new parents
I want new parents
The heckling died away
It's important for parents to set a good example, because their children are watching them
Christian parents can encourage good habits and behavior by doing things like: '\s Praying for and with them, so they learn how to talk with God
Continue earnestly in prayer, being vigilant in it
Reading and teaching them the Bible so they learn God's truth
Teach [God's commands] diligently to your children and talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down and when you rise up
Telling them about Jesus and leading them to faith in Him
Unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God'
The best way to set a good example for our children is to live out our faith in front of them
While they're looking, they're learning about what matters most.
SMITH magazine, an online community that 'celebrates the joy of storytelling invited readers to submit six-word memoirs that describe their lives
Thousands responded with brief biographies ranging from the light-hearted 'Sweet wife, good sons, I'm rich to the painful 'Sixty
Still haven't forgiven my parents
Based on Scripture, I tried to imagine how King Solomon might have summed up his life in six words
As a young man, he could have written: God has given me great wisdom
But in his later years, he might have said: Should have practiced what I preached
During a reign distinguished by peace and prosperity, Solomon developed spiritual heart problems
When he was old, 'his wives turned his heart after other gods; and his heart was not loyal to the Lord his God, as was the heart of his father David'
The result was God's displeasure and a sad end to a previously exemplary life
The multiple times Solomon used the word vanity in Ecclesiastes may indicate his disillusionment about life
This once-wise king who had it all, lost it all, and pondered it all, ended the book with this final conclusion: Fear God and keep His commandments
Those are six words worth heeding.
In his book A Crack in the Edge of the World, Simon Winchester writes of the small earthquake-prone town of Parkfield, California
Seeking to attract tourists, a hotel sign reads: Sleep Here When It Happens
A local restaurant menu features a large steak called The Big One and desserts are called Aftershocks
But all humor aside, a real earthquake can be a terrifying experience
I know
I've lived through California earthquakes
In the book of Acts, we read how God used an earthquake to open someone's heart to the gospel
Having been falsely accused, Paul and Silas found themselves in jail at Philippi
Around midnight, an earthquake rumbled through the prison, opening the doors and loosing the prisoners' chains
When the jailer learned that Paul and Silas had not tried to escape, he asked, 'What must I do to be saved?'
Paul responded, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household'
That night the jailer and his family believed and were baptized
And it all started with an earthquake
Sometimes life's upsets can make people more open to the gospel
Do you know anyone who is going through a crisis
Prayerfully stay in contact with them, and be ready to share a sensitive word of witness.
If you were to ask me who I am, I'd tell you that I'm a follower of Jesus
But I have to admit, at times following Him is a real challenge
He tells me to do things like rejoice when I'm persecuted ; to turn the other cheek ; to give to someone who wants to take from me ; to love my enemies, bless those who curse me, and do good to those who hate me
This kind of lifestyle seems very upside down to me
But I've come to realize that He's not upside down, I am
We have all been born fallen and broken
Being twisted by sin, our first instincts are often wrong, which inevitably leaves a big mess
We're like toast slathered with jelly that has fallen upside down on the kitchen floor
Left to ourselves, we can make a pretty big mess of things
Then Jesus comes along, like a divine spatula, scrapes us off the floor of our sinful ways, and turns us right side up
And as we follow His right-side-up ways, we discover that turning the other cheek keeps us from getting caught in a brawl, that it is more blessed to give than to receive, and that dying to self is life at its best
After all, His ways are not our ways , and I've come to realize that His ways are always best!
Ray Stedman told about a young man who had stopped attending the church Ray was pastoring
The young man said that when he was at work he would sometimes lose his temper and treat co-workers poorly
Then, when Sunday rolled around, he didn't want to go to church because he felt like a hypocrite
Stedman told his young friend, 'A hypocrite is someone who acts like something he isn't
When you come to church, you are acting like a Christian
You are not a hypocrite at church.'
Suddenly, the young man realized where he was being a hypocrite
He recognized that the answer was not in avoiding church but in changing the way he was at work
The term hypocrite is from a Greek word that means 'play-actor.'
It means we pretend to be something we aren't
Sometimes we forget our true identity as believers in Jesus
We forget that we are accountable to God
When we do that, we live the way we once walked and thus are hypocrites
Let's not let our old ways make us act like someone we're not
Instead, through God's grace, let's live in a way that shows we are 'alive together with Christ'
That's a sure cure for hypocrisy.
Fay Weldon went through what she thought was a near-death experience in 2006 when an allergic reaction stopped her heart
She retold her experience to Elizabeth Grice of the London Daily Telegraph
She said that a terrible creature tried to pull her through pearly gates, while doctors tried to pull her back
Later, she said, If that was dying, I don't want to do it again.
It's just more of the same
More struggle
Often the process of dying is a struggle
But death itself need not be feared by the believer in Christ, for it will bring us to heaven
In Revelation, John gives a wonderful description of what eternity with God will be like
He sees the New Jerusalem coming down out of heaven
The city of Jerusalem was a physical sign of the people of God and was described as the place where God dwells
The New Jerusalem, on the other hand, will not be made by human hands
It will be a place where God lives with His people eternally, and it will be a place of 'no more'?, no more pain, sorrow, and sickness
We don't know very much about eternity, but we do know that for the Christian, whatever our emotional and physical struggles are now, they will cease then
Life with God will be better by far.
The Chester Beatty Library in Dublin, Ireland, has an extensive collection of ancient Bible fragments dating back to the second century AD
One fragment on display is a piece of Acts 17:16
The message that ancient fragment displays, however, is as contemporary as today's newspaper
It reads, 'While Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him when he saw that the city was given over to idols.'
Paul was angered by the proliferation of idols in ancient Athens, and I am convinced he would be upset with us today
Some idols that we see in today's world are different than the ones in Paul's day
Whether it's wealth, fame, power, athletes, entertainers, or politicians, contemporary idols abound
As always, our spiritual enemy, Satan, seeks to lure us away from the Savior to the false worship of idols
Christians are not immune, and thus we must guard our hearts against self-righteous anger toward unbelievers who seem to worship everything but God
We must also be drawn by Christ's love to reach out to those who don't know Him
Then, like the believers at Thessalonica, they may turn 'to God from idols to serve the living and true God'
Jack and Trisha were driving to the hospital late one night for the birth of their second child when the unexpected happened
Trisha began to deliver the baby
Jack called 911 and Cherie White, an emergency dispatcher, was able to talk Jack through the delivery
But the baby wouldn't breathe
So Cherie then instructed Jack how to give emergency breathing, which he had to do for 6 anxious minutes
Finally the newborn took a breath and cried
When asked later how they all got through the ordeal and remained calm, Cherie responded, 'I'm glad God works midnights!'
I love to hear media reports in which God gets the glory He deserves for something good that has happened
In the Bible reading for today, it's obvious that God should get the credit for parting the Red Sea to help His people escape from Pharaoh, even though Moses was the one who raised his rod
All the Israelites and Moses gathered together and sang the Lord's praises: 'Who is like You, O Lord, among the gods
Who is like You, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?'
When something good happens, the Lord deserves the credit, for He is the source of all that is good
Give Him the glory
Aren't you glad He works midnights?
His face was grimy, his hair long and dirty
Beer stained his clothing and perfumed the air around him
When he stepped into the church building, the Sunday worshipers ignored him
They were stunned when the man approached the pulpit, took off his wig, and began preaching
That's when they realized he was their pastor
I don't know about you, but I tend to be friendly and shake hands with the people I know and those who pre-sent themselves well
James issued a serious warning for people like me
He said, 'If you show partiality, you commit sin'
Favoritism based on appearance or economic status has no place in God's family
In fact, it means we have 'become judges with evil thoughts'
Fortunately, we can guard against preferential treatment by loving our neighbor as ourselves, no matter who our neighbor may be
Reaching out to the homeless man, the hungry woman, or the heartbroken teen means we 'fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture'
In a world that keeps the outcast at arm's length, let's show the love of Christ and embrace the one who needs our care the most.
According to the ancient philosopher Aristotle, 'Nature abhors a vacuum.'
Aristotle based his conclusion on the observation that nature requires every space to be filled with something, even if that something is colorless, odorless air
The same principle is at work in our spiritual lives
When the Holy Spirit begins to convict us of sin, the idea of starting a self-improvement plan immediately comes to mind
We put forth our best effort to defeat our worst habits
But every attempt to get rid of unclean thoughts, attitudes, and desires is destined to fail because getting rid of one creates a vacuum in our souls
As soon as we empty ourselves of one vice, others move in to take its place
We end up just as bad or worse than when we started
Thinking about vacuums helps us to understand the importance of what Paul was saying to the Ephesians when he prayed that Christ would dwell in their hearts through faith and that they would 'know the love of Christ
that [they] may be filled with all the fullness of God'
The only permanent solution to the problem of sin in our lives is to replace it with the love of Jesus, which fills the vacuum
The more we are filled with His love, the less room there is for any evil thing.
Someone shared with me her observation about two bosses
One is loved but not feared by his subordinates
Because they love their boss but don't respect his authority, they don't follow his guidelines
The other boss is both feared and loved by those who serve under him, and their good behavior shows it
The Lord desires that His people both fear and love Him too
Today's Bible passage, Deuteronomy 10, says that keeping God's guidelines involves both
In verse 12, we are told 'to fear the Lord your God and to love Him
To fear the Lord God is to give Him the highest respect
For the believer, it is not a matter of feeling intimidated by Him or His character
But out of respect for His person and authority, we walk in all His ways and keep His commandments
Out of love, we serve Him with all our heart and with all our soul rather than merely out of duty
Love flows out of our deep gratitude for His love for us, rather than out of our likes and dislikes
We love Him because He first loved us
Our fear and love for God enable us to walk willingly in obedience to God's law.
It has become so commonplace to hear of the misconduct of a respected public figure that even though we may be deeply disappointed, we are hardly surprised
But how should we respond to the news of a moral failure, whether by a prominent person or a friend
We might begin by looking at ourselves
A century ago, Oswald Chambers told his students at the Bible Training College in London, 'Always remain alert to the fact that where one man has gone back is exactly where anyone may go back
Unguarded strength is double weakness.'
Chambers' words echo Paul's warning to be aware of our own vulnerability when we see the sins of others
After reviewing the disobedience of the Israelites in the wilderness , Paul urged his readers to learn from those sins so they wouldn't repeat them
He focused not on past failings but on present pride when he wrote, 'Let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall'
The head shaken in reproach is a common response to public sin
More helpful is the head that nods, Yes, I am capable of that, then bows in prayer for the one who has fallen and the one who thinks he stands.
Because I'm a writer, occasionally a friend will say to me, I want to write a book someday
That's a worthy goal, I reply, and I hope you do write a book
But it's better to be one than to write one
I'm thinking of the apostle Paul's words: 'Clearly you are an epistle of Christ
written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of flesh, that is, of the heart'
In his book The Practice of Piety, Lewis Bayly, chaplain to England's King James I, said that 'one who hopes to effect any good by his writings will find that he will instruct very few
The most powerful means, therefore, of promoting what is good is by example
One man in a thousand can write a book to instruct his neighbors
But every man can be a pattern of living excellence to those around him.'
The work that Christ is doing in believers can result in an influence far greater than any book they might write
Through God's Word, written on their hearts, the Lord is displaying His love and goodness for all to see
As a Christian, you may never write a book, but by living for God you will be one
You will be an open book, an 'epistle of Christ for all to read.
I've always thought that I could get through just about anything if the Lord would tell me what the outcome would be
I believe that all things work together for good in the end, but I'd do a lot better in dark times if I knew exactly what the 'good'
would look like
But God usually doesn't show us where He is taking us
He just asks us to trust Him
It's like driving a car at night
Our headlights never shine all the way to our destination; they illuminate only about 160 feet ahead
But that doesn't deter us from moving forward
We trust our headlights
All we really need is enough light to keep moving forward
God's Word is like headlights in dark times
It is full of promises we need to keep us from driving our lives into the ditch of bitterness and despair
His Word promises that He will never leave us nor forsake us
His Word assures us that He knows the plans He has for us, plans for wholeness and not for evil, to give us 'a future and a hope'
And He tells us that our trials are there to make us better, not bitter
So the next time you feel as if you're driving in the dark, remember to trust your headlights, God's Word will light your way.
Louis Armstrong was well known for his smiling face, raspy voice, white handkerchief, and virtuoso trumpet playing
Yet his childhood was one of want and pain
He was abandoned by his father as an infant and sent to reform school when he was only 12
Surprisingly, this became a positive turning point
Music professor Peter Davis regularly visited the school and provided musical training for the boys
Soon Louis excelled on the cornet and became the leader of the boys' band
His life trajectory seemed to have been reset to become a world-famous trumpet player and entertainer
Louis' story can be an example for Christian parents
The proverb: 'Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it'
can apply to more than the spiritual and moral aspects of our children's lives
We should also realize that a child's giftedness will often determine his or her area of interest
In the case of Louis, a little training in music resulted in a virtuoso trumpet player
As we lovingly provide to our children godly instruction from God's Word, we should encourage them in their interests and giftedness so that they might become all that God has planned for them to be.
A tour of the federal prison on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay left me with some unforgettable images
As our tour boat pulled into the dock, I could see why this now-closed maximum-security federal prison was once known as The Rock
Later, inside the legendary Big House, I stared at shafts of light coming through heavily barred windows
Then I saw row after row of cagelike cells that housed well-known inmates such as Al Capone and Robert Stroud, the 'Birdman of Alcatraz.'
But another image made a deeper impression
Stepping into an empty cell, I saw the name Jesus scrawled on a wall
In another, a Bible lay on a shelf
Together they quietly spoke of the greatest of all freedoms
Paul knew such liberty while waiting to be executed
Regarding himself as a prisoner of Christ, he used his incarceration to help other inmates discover what it means to be an eternally forgiven, dearly loved member of God's family
Barred windows and doors represent one kind of confinement
Physical paralysis, inescapable poverty, and prolonged unemployment are others
Perhaps you endure another
None are to be desired, yet who would trade 'imprisonment' with Christ for life on the outside without Him?
Can we really know whether to label life's circumstances as good or bad
For instance, your car breaks down right before you are to take a family road trip
But when you take the car to the shop, the mechanic says, 'Good thing you didn't take this out on the road
It could have caught fire.
Is that bad because of the inconvenience, or good because of God's protection
Or perhaps your child decides to pursue interests that aren't all that interesting to you
You wanted her to play basketball and run track in high school
But she wanted to sing and play the oboe
You feel frustrated, but she excels and ends up with a music scholarship
Is that bad because your dreams weren't fulfilled, or good because God directed her in ways you could not have predicted
Sometimes it's hard to see how God is working
His mysteries don't always reveal their secrets to us, and our journey is often redirected by uncontrollable detours
Perhaps God is showing us a better route
To make sure we benefit from what might seem bad, we must recognize and trust God's 'unfailing love'
In the end, we'll be able to say, 'I will sing to the Lord, for He has been good to me'
Sometimes people who serve God live with an unstated 'contract faith.'
Because they give time and energy to work for God, they think they deserve special treatment in return
But not my friend Douglas
He has lived a Job-like existence in many ways, experiencing the failure of a ministry, his wife's death from cancer, and injuries from a drunk driver to himself and a child
Yet Douglas advises, Don't confuse God with life
When troubles come and doubts arise, I often turn to Romans 8
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? asked Paul
'Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?'
In that one sentence, Paul summarized his ministry autobiography
He endured trials for the sake of the gospel; yet somehow he had the faith to believe that these things surely not good in themselves, could be used by God to accomplish good
He had learned to see past the hardships to a loving God who will one day prevail
He wrote, I am persuaded that [nothing] shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
Confidence like that can go a long way in helping overcome discouragement about how life hasn't worked out the way we thought it would.
Recently I attended a memorial service for a gifted musician whose life had touched many people
The tribute to this Christian woman included video and audio clips, photos, instrumentalists, and speakers
After everyone had left the church, I stopped to thank the technicians whose flawless work at the control board had contributed so much to this moving tribute
No one noticed what you did, I told them
That's the way we like it, they replied
In Matthew 6, Jesus told His disciples to give , pray , and fast in order to please God, not to gain praise from people
When you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place
Whether giving, praying, or fasting, Jesus said, 'Your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly'
Something within us makes us want to be seen and recognized for our good deeds
While there's nothing wrong with encouragement and appreciation, a desire for praise can undermine our service because it shifts the focus from others to ourselves
When there is no public thank you, we may feel slighted
But even when we serve God in secret, He sees it all.
I have a dear friend who served as a missionary in Suriname for many years
But in his final years he was stricken with an illness that paralyzed him
At times he wondered why God allowed him to linger
He longed to depart and to be with his Lord
Perhaps life is very hard for you or a loved one, and you are wondering why God has allowed you or your loved one to linger
When Jesus said He was going to heaven, Peter asked, 'Lord, why can I not follow You now?'
You, like Peter, may wonder why entry into heaven has been postponed: 'Why not now?'
God has a wise and loving purpose in leaving us behind
There is work to be done in us that can only be accomplished here on earth
Our afflictions, which are for the moment, are working for us 'a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory'
And there is work to be done for others, if only to love and to pray
Our presence may also be for the purpose of giving others an opportunity to learn love and compassion
So, though you may desire release for yourself or a loved one, to live on in the flesh can mean fruitfulness
And there is comfort in waiting: Though heaven may be delayed, God has His reasons
No doubt about it!
One of the smartest people I know is a college friend who became a Christian while studying at a state university
He graduated with honors and went on to study at a respected seminary
He served a small church as pastor for several years and then accepted a call to another small church far from family and friends
After 12 years at that church, he sensed that the congregation needed new leadership, so he stepped down
He hadn't been offered a job at a bigger church or a teaching position at a college or seminary
In fact, he didn't even have another job
He just knew that God was leading him in a different direction, so he followed
When we discussed it, my friend said, 'A lot of people talk about being called to something, but I don't hear much about being called from something.'
In many ways, my friend's obedience was like that of Israel's patriarch Abraham, who went out, not knowing where God was leading
Difficulties like famine , fear , and family disputes gave reason for doubt, but Abraham persevered and because of his faith God counted him as righteous
A life of obedience may not be easy, but it will be blessed .
Detective Allan Pinkerton became famous in the mid-1800s by solving a series of train robberies and foiling a plot to assassinate Abraham Lincoln as he traveled to his first inauguration
As one of the first agencies of its kind in the US, the Pinkerton National Detective Agency gained even more prominence because of its logo of a wide-open eye with the caption, 'We Never Sleep.'
There is no better feeling than knowing you are protected and secure
You feel peaceful when the doors are locked and all is quiet as you drift off to sleep at night
You feel safe
But many lie awake in their beds with fearful thoughts of the present or dread of the future
Some are afraid of commotion outside or of a spouse who has been violent
Some cannot rest because of worry over a rebellious child
Others are anxiously listening to make sure a seriously ill child is still breathing
These are the times when our loving God encourages us to cry out to Him, to the One who will neither 'slumber nor sleep
Psalm 34:15 reminds us that 'the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their cry
Pinkerton may have been the original private eye, but the One who really has the eye that never sleeps is listening to the cries of the righteous
After Ffyona Campbell became famous as the first woman to walk around the world, her joy was short-lived
Despite the adulation she received, something troubled her
Guilt overtook her and pushed her to the brink of a nervous breakdown
What was bothering her
I shouldn't be remembered as the first woman to walk around the world, she finally admitted
I cheated
During her worldwide trek, she broke the guidelines of the Guinness Book of World Records by riding in a truck part of the way
To clear her conscience, she called her sponsor and confessed her deception
God has given each of us a conscience that brings guilt when we do wrong
In Romans, Paul describes our conscience as 'accusing or else excusing [us]
For the obedient follower of Christ, care of the conscience is an important way of maintaining a moral compass despite moral imperfection
Confessing sin, turning from it, and making restitution should be a way of life
Paul modeled a well-maintained conscience, saying, I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man
Through confession and repentance, he kept short accounts with God
Is sin bothering you
Follow Paul's example
Strive for a clear conscience.
I read these words on a young woman's personal Web site: 'I just want to be loved, and he has to be amazing!'
Isn't that what we all want, to be loved, to feel cared for by someone
And so much the better if he or she is amazing
The one who fits that description most fully is Jesus Christ
In a display of unprecedented love, He left His Father in heaven and came to earth as the baby we celebrate at Christmas
Then, after living a perfect life, He gave His life as an offering to God on the cross in our behalf
He took our place because we needed to be rescued from our sin and its death penalty
'While we were still sinners, Christ died for us'
Then 3 days later, the Father raised Jesus to life again
When we repent and receive Jesus' gift of amazing love, He becomes our Savior, Lord , Teacher, and Friend
Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!
Looking for someone to love you
Jesus loves us so much more than anyone else possibly could
And He is truly amazing!
Norena's South Florida home was severely damaged during Hurricane Andrew in 1992
She received an insurance settlement, and the repair work began
But the contractors left when the money ran out, leaving an unfinished home with no electricity
For 15 years, Norena got by with a tiny refrigerator and a few lamps connected to extension cords
Surprisingly, her neighbors didn't seem to notice her dilemma
Then, acting on a tip, the mayor got involved and contacted an electrical contractor who restored power to her house within a few hours
When Jesus encountered the Samaritan woman at the well , He got involved in her life and talked to her about her need for spiritual power
He established common ground with her and piqued her spiritual interest and curiosity
He was gracious and sensitive as He confronted her sin and kept the conversation centered on the main issue
Then He confronted her directly with who He was as Messiah
As a result, she and many other Samaritans believed in Him
Let's get involved in the lives of others and tell them about Jesus
He is the only source of spiritual power and satisfies our deepest longings.
The lounging lions in Kenya's Masai Mara game reserve looked harmless
They rolled on their backs in low-lying bushes, rubbed their faces on branches as if trying to comb their magnificent manes
They drank leisurely from a stream
They strode slowly across dry, scrubby terrain as if they had all the time in the world
The only time I saw their teeth was when one of them yawned
Their serene appearance is deceiving, however
The reason they can be so relaxed is that they have nothing to fear, no shortage of food and no natural predators
The lions look lazy and listless, but they are the strongest and fiercest of all
One roar sends all other animals running for their lives
Sometimes it seems as if God is lounging
When we don't see Him at work, we conclude that He's not doing anything
We hear people mock God and deny His existence, and we anxiously wonder why He doesn't defend Himself
But God will not be afraid of their voice nor be disturbed by their noise
He has nothing to fear
One roar from Him, and His detractors will scatter like rodents
If you wonder why God isn't anxious when you are, it's because He has everything under control
He knows that Jesus, the Lion of Judah, will triumph.
In a brief biography of St Francis of Assisi, GK Chesterton begins with a glimpse into the heart of this unique and compassionate man born in the 12th century
Chesterton writes: 'As St Francis did not love humanity but men, so he did not love Christianity but Christ
The reader cannot even begin to see the sense of a story that may well seem to him a very wild one, until he understands that to this great mystic his religion was not a thing like a theory but a thing like a love-affair.'
When Jesus was asked to name the greatest command in the Law, He replied, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind
This is the first and great commandment
The questioner wanted to test Jesus, but the Lord answered him with the key element in pleasing God
First and foremost, our relationship with Him is a matter of the heart
If we see God as a taskmaster and consider obedience to Him as a burden, then we have joined those of whom the Lord said, 'I have this against you, that you have left your first love'
The way of joy is to love the Lord with all our heart, soul, and mind.
Few things disable new workers on a job like criticism from veterans
Good hiring managers know to protect new employees by surrounding them with mentors willing to shield them from unnecessary barbs
Hannah is a mentor to us in dealing with criticism and deep desires of the heart
Surrounded by a husband who didn't understand, a taunting peer, and an overly judgmental clergyman, Hannah found a way through the fog by confiding in God
While we now know God answered the prayer of Hannah's heart by giving her a child, we don't know for sure if Eli's blessing was a wish or a promise from God
I think her no-longer-sad face came most of all because she gained peace from confiding in Him
We were created to be in relationship with God; and when we take that relationship to an intimate level, it bonds us not only to His presence but also to His strength
Prayers that express our hurts and emotions are most assuredly welcomed by God because they demonstrate our trust in Him
We will often find perspective, and nearly always come away comforted, knowing we've entrusted the things that are troubling us, whether criticism or deep desires, to the One who is best able to sort through them.
Does it surprise you that trouble is a part of life
Probably not
We all know trouble close-up and personal, bad health, empty bank account, blighted love, grief, loss of job, and the list goes on
It shouldn't surprise us, therefore, that God permits the added trials of being ridiculed and hated because we follow Christ
But trouble, whether it is common to man or unique to Christians, can reveal to us the moral fiber of our soul
I have never seen a golf course without hazards
They are part of the game
Golfers speak of the courses with the most hazards as the most challenging, and they will travel a long way to test their skill against the most demanding 18 holes
Oliver Wendell Holmes said, If I had a formula for bypassing trouble, I wouldn't pass it around
I wouldn't be doing anyone a favor
Trouble creates a capacity to handle it
Meet it as a friend, for you'll see a lot of it and you had better be on speaking terms with it
Let's not think it strange when trouble comes, for God is using it to test the stamina of our souls
The best way to handle trouble is to commit our souls, in doing good, as to a faithful Creator
A hotel in Singapore introduced an express buffet eat all you can in 30 minutes and pay just half the price
After that experience, one diner reported: 'I lost my decorum, stuffing my mouth with yet more food
and I lost my appetite for the rest of the day, so severe was my heartburn.'
Sometimes I think in our devotional reading we treat God's Word like an express buffet
We wolf it down as fast as we can and wonder why we haven't learned very much
Like physical food, spiritual food needs chewing
For those of us who have been Christians for a long time, we may have a tendency to speed-read through the passages we've read many times before
But in doing so, we miss what God is meaning to show us
One sure sign of this is when we learn nothing new from that passage
David's desire was right when he wrote in Psalm 119:15, 'I will meditate on Your precepts, and contemplate Your ways.'
That's the way to treat God's Word, to take time to mull it over
Let's not come to the Bible as if we were going to an express buffet
Only by meditating on God's Word will we get the most value for our spiritual well-being.
I've always thought that you can see the hand of God best in the rearview mirror
Looking back, it's easier to understand why He placed us in the home that He did; why He brought certain people and circumstances into and out of our lives; why He permitted difficulties and pain; why He took us to different places and put us in various jobs and careers
In my own life, I get a lot of clarity about the wise and loving ways of God as I reflect on the ways He has managed my journey by 'the works of [His] hands'
With the psalmist, it makes me glad and strikes a note of joy in my heart to see how often God has assisted, directed, and managed the outcomes so faithfully
Looking ahead, though, is not always so clear
Have you ever had that lost feeling when the road ahead seems twisted, foggy, and scary
Before you move into next year, stop and look in the rearview mirror of the year gone by, and joyfully realize that God meant it when He said, I will never leave you nor forsake you
So we may boldly say: The Lord is my helper
I will not fear
With the promise of God's presence and help in mind, you can move ahead into 2011 with utmost confidence.
In a letter to his son Eduard, Albert Einstein gave this advice: 'Life is like riding a bicycle
To keep your balance you must keep moving.'
The great physicist's advice is wise and practical
This wise counsel can apply to the Christian life
Many believers by faith keep moving ahead through painful and trying circumstances
But when they experience a personal moral failure, they lose their balance and fall
Their regret and feeling of unworthiness of God's forgiveness may then keep them down and they no longer move ahead in their spiritual life
The Bible gives us many examples of those who have experienced serious personal failure
Abraham lied to Pharaoh about his wife, Sarah
Jacob deceived his father to acquire Esau's blessing
Moses disobeyed God by striking the rock instead of speaking to it
Despite their failures, we are told: 'all these
obtained a good testimony through faith'
These biblical characters are lifted up as examples because after they fell, they turned back to God and began to follow Him again
Have you lost your spiritual balance through a sinful choice, which is keeping you down
Repent and follow the God of second chances once again.
In the frenzied early days of the Internet, Web developers were making up their own rules
The result was confusion
Among the problems was that what looked good on one computer was unreadable on another
This caused developers to refer to the Internet as the wild, wild Web, an allusion to the days of the wild, wild West in the US when law and order were pretty much nonexistent
To bring order out of chaos, Web developers started calling for others to agree on common standards
Their plea reminds us of why it was important for the Israelites to have laws to live by when they left Egypt
Without them, there would be anarchy
With them, however, they would have a system that was so superior that it would demonstrate to other nations the greatness of their God
Today, to bring order out of the chaos of our sinful, selfish world, believers submit to the law of Christ , who Himself is the fulfillment of the law
When we submit to the standard established by Christ and love others as God loves us, we will live in peace with one another and thus provide a witness to the world of how great God is.
During the last week of December, newscasters often look back at the significant events of the past year, the triumphs and failures of prominent people, natural disasters, economic challenges, and the deaths of celebrities and leaders
The most surprising events usually receive top billing
If you reviewed the past year of your life, what would appear on the list
Has an unexpected event caused you to question God or to more deeply experience His goodness
Psalm 77 chronicles the lament of a person in distress who felt as if God no longer cared
'Has His mercy ceased forever
Has His promise failed forevermore?'
Yet, even in anguish, the psalmist said, 'I will remember the works of the Lord; surely I will remember Your wonders of old'
The result was a renewal of trust and hope: 'You are the God who does wonders; You have declared Your strength among the peoples'
As you think back over this past year, why not write down the significant events in your life
Don't be afraid to include your difficulties and disappointments, but remember to consider all the ways God has been with you
During every difficulty, we can always find the faithfulness of God.
Did you hear about the church that didn't have enough room for parking
Fortunately, it was located right next to a store that was closed on Sundays, so a church member asked the store owner if they could overflow into his parking lot
No problem, he said, You can use it 51 weeks out of the year, on the 52nd week, though, it will be chained off
The man was grateful, but asked curiously, What happens that week
The store owner smiled, Nothing
I just want you to remember that it's not your parking lot
It's easy to take for granted all the material and spiritual blessings that God has given us
That's why we need to stop and remember that Scripture says the true owner of all we possess is God: 'All that is in heaven and in earth is Yours
Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and You are exalted as head over all
Even our bodies do not belong to us: 'Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit
and you are not your own
For you were bought at a price
As 1 Timothy 6:17 reminds us: God gives us richly all things to enjoy
We are so abundantly blessed with good things
Let's never take our Father for granted, but use wisely and gratefully all that He has given us.
As my wife reviewed her day, she told me about an incident that took place with our granddaughter Eliana, who was visiting
Eliana had been playing with some toys, so when she wanted to go to another part of the house, Grandma told her, Eliana, you need to put your toys away first
Without missing a beat, Eliana replied, I don't have time
She was just 2 years old at the time, so she was definitely not running on a packed schedule
I wonder sometimes if God might be a bit surprised with us when He hears our responses to His commands
For instance, when Jesus says, 'Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden and we say, I can't go on
I have too many troubles and problems, I wonder what He thinks
When He says, Be still, and know that I am God, and we say, I can't fit You into my schedule, I wonder what He thinks
When He says, Be holy, for I am holy, and we say, But the world looks like so much fun, I wonder what He thinks
God has spoken
Obedience is the best way to honor Him for what He has done for us and to show Him how much we love Him.
The Christmas story, recorded in Matthew and Luke, has become so familiar that I wonder if we grasp the reality of what actually happened: An angel told a young virgin that she would conceive a child by the power of the Holy Spirit
The angel then told her fiancé to marry her and name the baby Jesus, 'for He will save His people from their sins'
Shepherds saw angels in the sky and were told of a Savior's birth in Bethlehem
Wise men traveled hundreds of miles to worship the One who, they said, 'has been born King of the Jews'
Amazing
Equally astonishing is that Mary, Joseph, the shepherds, and the wise men did exactly as they had been told
Mary yielded herself to God; Joseph took her home as his wife; the shepherds went to Bethlehem to find the baby in a manger; and the wise men followed the star
With no idea of the outcome, they all took the next step by faith in the Lord
Amazing
How is it with us this Christmas
Will we trust God and follow His leading even when we face uncertainty and overwhelming circumstances
When you and I obey the Lord, the outcome is truly amazing!
I wouldn't want to pick a fight with a sky full of angels, but I must admit that I've always wondered about the promise of peace the angelic host made to the shepherds in the fields outside Bethlehem
For the last 2,000 years, peace on our planet has been at best a rare commodity
Wars continue to ravage innocent lives, domestic violence is a growing calamity, divorce rates soar, churches split, and peace in our restless and wayward hearts seems to be an elusive dream
Where is the promised peace
Actually, on reflection, we can see that Jesus brought all that is needed for peace in our world
He taught the principles of peace, calling for people to love their neighbors as they love themselves
And as He was leaving this planet, He promised, 'Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you'
He told us to turn the other cheek, go the extra mile, forgive offenses, reject greed, tolerate each other's weaknesses, live to serve and love one another as He has loved us
It seems that in large part, peace is up to us
In Isaiah's words, 'We have turned, every one, to his own way'
God's solution to our waywardness was unimaginable: The Artist paid the price to recreate what we ruined
One day, there will be another opening ceremony, and everyone in heaven and on earth will bow at the name of Jesus
And those from every nation who have accepted God's plan in Christ will worship together in the flawless New Jerusalem .
The Puritans wisely sought to connect all of life to its source in God, bringing the two worlds together rather than dividing them into sacred and secular
They had a saying, 'God loveth adverbs; and careth not how good, but how well.'
Adverbs describe verbs our words of action and activity
The proverb implies that God cares more about the spirit in which we live than the concrete results
Pleasing God doesn't mean that we must busy ourselves with a new set of 'spiritual' activities
As the Puritans said, whether cleaning house or preaching sermons, shoeing horses or translating the Bible, any human activity may constitute an offering to God
We spend much time immersed in the mundane
'But we have the mind of Christ,' Paul reminds us
That truth is to guide everything we do
Caring for an elderly parent
Cleaning up after a child
Sitting on a porch with a neighbor
Fielding a customer's complaint
Filling out patient charts at a nurses' station
Sitting in traffic
Sawing lumber
Reporting tips
Shopping for groceries
We need faith and the mind of the Lord Jesus to recognize something of lasting value in even our most ordinary tasks.
Mark your calendar now if you want to see the next celestial convergence of Venus, Jupiter, and the moon
On November 18, 2052, you'll be able to peer through the evening darkness as those solar system neighbors 'gather' in a tiny area of the sky
That remarkable juxtaposition of reflective spheres last sparkled the night sky on December 1, 2008, and it will happen again 4 decades from now
This predictability, as well as things such as eclipses and the return of Halley's Comet , prove the orderliness of the universe
If no fixed set of laws governed the movement of everything in the universe, such predictions could not be made
Are these set rules more than random standards
Can we see God's hand in these celestial certainties
Look at Jeremiah 33:25-26
God has in view the covenantal relationship between Himself and His people, and He uses a scientific fact in the analogy
In effect, God says that His fixed universal laws, 'the ordinances of heaven and earth have the same certainty as His promises to His covenant people
God's laws have governed the universe since its creation and continue to do so with astounding predictability
So mark your calendar, and be amazed by God's unchanging control.
Jean-Dominique Bauby's memoir, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, describes his life after a massive stroke left him with a condition called 'Locked-In Syndrome.'
Although he was almost completely paralyzed, Bauby was able to write his book by blinking his left eyelid
An aide would recite a coded alphabet, until Bauby blinked to choose the letter of a word he was dictating
The book required about 200,000 blinks to write
Bauby used the only physical ability left him to communicate with others
In 2 Timothy we read of Paul experiencing a different kind of 'locked-in syndrome.'
Under house arrest, the apostle learned that his execution might be imminent
With this in view, he told Timothy: 'I suffer trouble even to the point of chains; but the Word of God is not chained'
In spite of his isolation, Paul welcomed visitors, wrote letters of encouragement, and rejoiced at the spread of God's Word
For some of us, circumstances may have isolated us from others
Lying in a hospital bed, serving time in a prison, or being a shut-in can make us feel that we are experiencing our own 'locked-in syndrome.'
If this is true for you, why not prayerfully reflect on some ways you can still reach out to others.
Imagine going to work one day and being greeted by your boss, who says, 'Come by my office at 9:30
I'd like to talk to you about how you're doing on the job.'
This could be a nervous time for you as you think about what your supervisor might say
You wonder, How does my boss think I've been doing
Could there be a promotion with a pay increase
Or could I lose my job
Am I going to hear, 'Well done' or 'You're done'?
As important as this kind of meeting is, the Bible speaks of another, far more significant review
After this life is past, we will stand before our Lord
Paul wrote, 'For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad'
We will not enter that future evaluation fearful of losing our salvation, nor will we desire personal benefit or human approval
Instead, we will be eager to hear the Master say, 'Well done, good and faithful servant'
The challenge before us as followers of Christ is to serve Him with excellence now so that we can hear His words, 'Well done' then
Based on the way I am living today, what kind of review will I get when I see the Savior?
A missionary and I were invited to lunch with David, a man in his late seventies who generously supported the missionary's ministry
David was not able to visit the missionary's country
but as he gave thanks for the food, he prayed with complete ease for the people, places, and situations there
David had a perspective on missions that extended beyond his own country of Singapore
Our Lord Jesus commanded us to have a worldwide perspective on missions
When He said, 'Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations,
teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you'
He was not asking us to buy an around-the-world ticket to do His bidding
We may not have the opportunity to travel much beyond our own birthplace, 
but we can be involved with what's going on in the world without leaving our hometown
But how
Is there an international student living near you
A family from another country who is trying to cope with life in a new country
Or just a lonely person whom you can cheer up
Sharing Jesus' love with them is your way of crossing the oceans with the gospel.
The highway that winds around the southern shore of Lake Michigan can be treacherous in the winter
One weekend as we were driving back to Grand Rapids from Chicago, a buildup of snow and ice slowed traffic, caused numerous accidents, and almost doubled our drive time
We were relieved as we eased off the expressway onto our final road
It was then that my husband said out loud, 'Thanks, Lord
I think I can take it from here.
Just as he finished saying the words, our car spun around 180 degrees
As we came to a stop, hearts pounding
we could just imagine God saying: 'Are you sure?'
Why do we sometimes try to go it alone in life when at every moment we have access to God
He said: 'I am with you and will keep you wherever you go'
And He assures us: 'I will never leave you nor forsake you'
Scottish mathematician, theologian, and preacher Thomas Chalmers wrote: 'When I walk by the wayside, He is along with me
When I enter into company, amid all my forgetfulness of Him, He never forgets me
Go where I will, He tends me, and watches me, and cares for me.
What a comfort to know that God is always with us we don't need to go through life alone!
On January 1, 2008, Keith Severin and his 7-year-old son, Adrien, agreed that they would spend at least 15 minutes every day that year searching together for treasure
Carlos Alcala's article in the Sacramento Bee described how they went out each day in every kind of weather to see what they could find
A year later their collection of coins, golf balls, recyclable bottles and cans, and various other items had yielded more than $1,000
In the process, they enjoyed many hours of companionship and fun
If we decided to spend 15 minutes a day searching for treasure in the Bible, what would we find
Solomon wrote: 'If you seek [wisdom] as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures; then you will understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God
Then you will understand righteousness and justice, equity and every good path'
Growth won't happen all at once
But gradually, day by day, we will be changed through reading God's Word and obeying Him
And think of the privilege and pleasure of spending time with our heavenly Father
It begins with a willing commitment, continues with exciting discoveries, and leads to the treasure of wisdom and life.
Longtime California pastor Ray Stedman once told his congregation: 'On New Year's Eve we realize more than at any other time in our lives that we can never go back in time
We can look back and remember, but we cannot retrace a single moment of the year that is past.'
Stedman then referred to the Israelites as they stood on the edge of a new opportunity
After four decades of desert wanderings by their people, this new generation may have wondered if they had the faith and fortitude to possess the Promised Land
Their leader, Moses, reminded them that they had seen 'every great act of the Lord which He did' and that their destination was 'a land for which the Lord your God cares; the eyes of the Lord your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year to the very end of the year'
On New Year's Eve, we may fear the future because of events in the past
But we need not remain chained to our old memories because we can move ahead focused on God
Just as the Lord watched over the land and His people, so His eyes will be upon us
God's faithful care will extend to every day of the new year
We can count on that promise.
The former athlete had neglected his body for too long, so he began an exercise routine
The first day, he did several push-ups and went for a light jog
The next day, more push-ups, a few sit-ups, and a longer run
Day 3: exercises and a mile-and-a-half run
On Day 4, our ex-athlete in re-training woke up with a sore throat
Then he did one more exercise: He jumped to the conclusion that exercising was a bad idea
If all he got out of his huffing and puffing was sickness, it wasn't for him
Let's examine another scenario
A Christian, realizing he has neglected his relationship with God, begins a new spiritual routine of Bible-reading and prayer
But after just a few days, some problems arise in his life
What does he conclude
Like the ex-athlete, should he decide that his spiritual quest was a bad idea and that it didn't do any good
Certainly not
We don't pray and read the Bible to get a perfect, trouble-free life
Pursuing God is not cause and effect
We do it because it draws us closer in our relationship with the One who is perfect
The pursuit of godliness will not exempt us from trouble
But a life dedicated to loving and pursuing God is always a good idea no matter what happens.
Alyssa, who is 6 and just learning to read, often saw her parents and grandparents reading their Bibles in the morning
Early one day, she woke up before everyone else
Grandma found her sitting on the couch, with her Bible and a devotional booklet on her lap
She wanted to follow the example of spending time with God at the beginning of the day
Timothy, a young pastor, faced heavy responsibilities in the church at Ephesus
training believers, leading in worship, countering false doctrine
The older, experienced apostle Paul gave him instruction on leading the church in these areas
but he also mentioned the importance of personal conduct
He said, 'Be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity'
Paul challenged Timothy: 'Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine'
If he paid attention to his own spiritual life and to solid doctrine, he would be a godly example to the church family
We all have others who are observing us
Even little Alyssa has younger siblings watching her
Let's live our lives in such a way that those who follow our example will help others in their walk with God.
Along the old Oregon Trail in Idaho there is a marker a giant lava boulder known locally as Register Rock
It's located in an area which was one of the favorite overnight camping areas for westbound immigrants who traveled the trail in the 19th century
Travelers often inscribed their names on the rock as a memorial to their passage
Register Rock stands as a monument to their courage and tenacity
When I think of Register Rock, I think of other pilgrims who have passed by us on their journey
Hebrews 11 lists some of those hardy souls Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, and Samuel, to name a few
But there are other more recent pilgrims: my mother and father, my fifth-grade Sunday school teacher Mrs Lincoln, my youth leader John Richards, my mentors Ray Stedman and Howard Hendricks, and a host of others I could name
They may not have inscribed their names on rocks, but they're written in my memory
The author of Hebrews reminds us to remember 'pilgrims' who have gone before us, especially those 'who have spoken the Word of God' to us and to consider 'the outcome of their conduct'
And, most important, he encourages us to follow their faith.
Has God ever asked you to do something that seemed unreasonable
Something that took you into the territory of the unknown
What if He asked you to refuse a long-awaited promotion or resist a longed-for relationship
What if He called you to a remote part of the world or asked you to release your children to serve Him in a faraway place
The unknown is full of haunting 'what ifs.'
Yet God often calls us to chart unknown territory as we follow Him
Obeying His commands to forgive, to give away our treasures, or to give up things that provide security and pleasure often leave us in the scary territory of unknown outcomes
Imagine how Abraham felt when God asked him to move his whole family without telling him where they were going
God also asked Abraham to persevere to stay in an unknown land even when the lure of past comforts may have threatened to seduce him and his family back to their comfort zone in Ur
Entering a new year is like entering uncharted territory
The fear of the unknown could cripple our capacity to follow God's leading through the days ahead
Yet, like Abraham, when we cling to the One who knows all things, we're in good hands regardless of where He leads.
Some words used to describe the opening ceremony of the 2008 summer Olympics were awesome, breathtaking, and extravagant
One commentator observed, 'This shows what happens when you give an artist an unlimited budget.'
When I heard this, I thought, That's what God did at creation
He held nothing back
The resulting universe is stunning in beauty, staggering in complexity, extravagant in all regards
The Olympic ceremony was perfect in its precision; but if just one drummer or dancer had decided to alter the artist's vision, the whole ceremony would have been flawed
That's what happened shortly after creation
Unlike the Olympic producer, God allowed free choice, and His work of art was marred by Adam and Eve's idea of a better way
In 1955, when the South was still highly segregated, Emmett Till, a black teenager from Chicago, visited relatives in Mississippi
After Emmett 'dared' to talk to a white woman, two white men brutally murdered him
An all-white, male jury found the two 'not guilty' after deliberating for barely an hour
The two men later confessed to the crime in a Life magazine article
Following the verdict, Emmett's mother said, 'Two months ago I had a nice apartment in Chicago
I had a good job
I had a son
When something happened to Negroes in the South, I said, '\sThat's their business, not mine.' 
Now I know how wrong I was
The murder of my son has shown me that what happens to any of us, anywhere in the world, had better be the business of us all.'
Making another's concerns our own is what Leviticus 19:18 calls us to do: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'
Jesus quotes this verse and interprets it as not placing any limitations on loving those around us
Our neighbor doesn't just mean someone close by; it's anyone who has a need
We are to care for others as we care for ourselves
To love our neighbor means to make the persecution, suffering, and injustice of our fellow human beings our own
It is the business of all who follow Christ.
In Psalm 139, David describes God as fashioning his tiny body together in the darkness of his mother's womb
God loved David before he ever existed
God designed the person David was to be, and He brought that person into being according to His predetermined plan
In this psalm, David used the intriguing metaphor of a journal in which God first wrote His plan and then brought that plan into fruition through His handiwork in the womb
Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed And in Your book they all were written
Put another way, David was shaped by his heavenly Father's love into a unique creation
He came from the inventive heart and hand of God
What was true of David is true of you
You are special along with everyone else in the world
This being true, we must be pro-life in the purest sense of the word
We are to respect and cherish all human life: the born and those still in the womb; winsome children and weary seniors; the wealthy executive and the financially destitute
All persons are unique productions of our Creator's genius
With David, let's exclaim: 'I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made'
Barbara Mertz has a complaint about Egypt's Pharaoh Ramses II
In her book Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs, archaeologist Mertz writes, 'One gets so tired of Ramses; his face, his figure, and/or his name are plastered over half the wall surfaces still standing in Egypt at least it seems that way.'
Insatiably thirsty for glory, Ramses reveled in Egyptian religion, which taught that the pharaoh was divine
Contrast Ramses' desire for glory with the attitude of Paul and Barnabas
On one of their missionary journeys, they faced a situation during which they refused to accept vainglory
When a crowd in the idolatrous city of Lystra saw them heal a crippled man, the people exclaimed, 'The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!'
They immediately prepared animals to sacrifice in honor of Paul and Barnabas
But the two quickly objected, saying, 'We also are men with the same nature as you, and preach to you that you should turn from these useless things to the living God'
We do not rival the apostles in our accomplishments for God, but we all have things we do for Him
It's then that we must be 'glory deflectors,' making sure God gets all the glory for everything we have done.
A year ago today, 155 people on US Airways Flight 1549 thought they were going to die
During take-off from New York City, their plane struck a flock of geese, disabling both engines
In a powerless glide, the captain maneuvered over the densely populated area, then announced: 
Brace for impact
Less than 90 seconds later, the crippled plane made a water landing in the frigid Hudson River, where boats and ferries quickly arrived to rescue the passengers and crew, all of whom survived
People called it the 'miracle on the Hudson' and praised the pilot and crew
One grateful passenger said simply, 'We have a second chance in life.'
In times of crisis, we grasp the importance of every hour
During our ordinary routine, however, we often forget that each day is a second chance
'Through the Lord's mercies we are not consumed, because His compassions fail not 
They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness
'\sThe Lord is my portion,' says my soul, 'therefore I hope in Him!'
We can choose to live with thankfulness for God's mercy and grace, with confidence in His faithful care, and with hope because He is with us forever
Today, God offers us a second chance in life
Let's make the most of it!
For hundreds of years, windmills around the world have been used to pump water and to process grains
But in the last few decades, as wind turbines producing electricity have become more prevalent, a 'fly in the ointment' unexpectedly occurred
Researchers discovered that windpower generators worked fine at slow speeds
but at high-wind velocity, bugs on the blades reduced power output
Operators found that it was necessary to regularly wash off the buildup of dead insects to avoid having them slowly decrease the turbine's power
A buildup of sin in a Christian's life can be a problem as well
God has provided a way to clear the accumulation of sins from our lives
First John 1:9 reminds us: 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.'
But unless we do that often, we'll be running on diminished power
That's because the power for living comes from God and not us
When we try to live the Christian life in our own strength, we'll feel defeated, like windmills robbed of their energy
God's power can be more easily seen and experienced in our lives when we get rid of sin's buildup every day.
The recent global financial crisis caused people to pay closer attention to their credit report
When credit was easy to get, some people became careless about how they used it
They didn't bother to save for what they wanted; they just borrowed
Being in debt was no big deal
But in a crisis, that is no longer the case
Having good credit is suddenly very important
After an advertisement for a credit repair service, a local newscaster said, 'Credit repair isn't something you can buy; it's something you have to work for.'
The same principle applies to the credibility of our lives
We can't buy it; it's something we have to work for
We may be able to 'borrow' credibility for a while by associating ourselves with credible people
but sooner or later we will need our own
Credibility has to do with the ability to elicit belief
The reason it's essential for Christians is that our lives affect God's reputation
When we call ourselves by Christ's name, His reputation is tied to ours
If people have reason not to believe us, they may not believe God
The way to earn credibility is to live honorably
Then others will believe and glorify God.
When I was a kid, I dreamed of becoming a black belt in karate
Several years ago, I began training and came close to fulfilling that goal
However, two belts away from my goal, I quit
There were two reasons my teacher changed styles in the middle of my training, and I got so busy that I could not devote adequate time for training
Almost every week, I am nagged by the thought that God wants me to be a finisher in all aspects of my life but especially in my service for Him
As Paul spoke of the conclusion of his life, he did not have any nagging thoughts of unfinished business about his ministry
In this final farewell , Paul used imagery-rich words to talk about finishing his service for Christ
He described his life and ministry in terms of a fight: 'I have fought the good fight.'
The fight was good because he had engaged in it for God and the gospel
Then he used the imagery of a race as synonymous with his ministry: 'I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.'
Paul affirmed that by God's grace he had finished all that God had given him to do
As followers of Jesus, let us strive to be finishers, persevering in our service for Jesus Christ.
He knew that day where he would spend eternity
Realizing that we are sinners and placing our trust in Jesus' death and resurrection assures us that we can immediately know where we will spend our eternal tomorrows when we slip behind the parted curtain.
Spiridon Louis isn't well known around the world, but he is in Greece
That's because of what happened in 1896 when the Olympic Games were revived in Athens
During the competition that year, the Greeks did quite well winning the most medals of any nation
But the event that became a source of true Greek pride was the first-ever marathon
Seventeen athletes competed in this race of 40 kilometers , but it was won by Louis a common laborer
For his efforts, Louis was honored by king and country, and he became a national hero
The apostle Paul used running a race as a picture of the Christian life
In 1 Corinthians 9:24, he challenged us not just to run but to run to win
He said 'Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize
Run in such a way that you may obtain it.'
Not only did Paul teach this but he lived it out
In his final epistle, he said, 'I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith'
Having finished his race, Paul joyfully anticipated receiving the victory crown from the King of heaven
Like Paul, run your earthly race to win and to please your King.
The word connected captures our contemporary experience of life
Many people rarely go anywhere without a cell phone, iPod, laptop, or pager
We have become accessible 24 hours a day
Some psychologists see this craving to stay connected as an addiction
Yet a growing number of people are deliberately limiting their use of technology
Being a 'tech-no' is their way of preserving times of quiet, while limiting the flow of information into their lives
Many followers of Christ find that a daily time of Bible reading and prayer is essential in their walk of faith
This 'quiet time' is a disconnection from external distractions in order to connect with God
The 'green pastures' and 'still waters' of Psalm 23:2 are more than an idyllic country scene
They speak of our communion with God whereby He restores our souls and leads us in His paths
All of us can make time to meet with God, but do we
In Robert Foster's booklet '7 Minutes With God,' he suggests a way to begin
Start with a brief prayer for guidance, then read the Bible for a few minutes, and close with a short time of prayer that includes adoration, confession, thanksgiving, and supplication for others
It's vital to take time today to connect with the Lord, who is our life.
William Adams is believed to be the first Englishman to reach Japan
Taking a liking to Adams, the ruling Japanese shogun made him his interpreter and personal advisor concerning the Western powers
Eventually, Adams was presented with two swords with rank of a Samurai
This showed just how much the Japanese revered Adams
Because William Adams served his foreign king well, he was also rewarded with greater opportunity for influence
Centuries earlier, another man in a foreign country also had great influence over his king
Nehemiah was a cupbearer to Persian King Artaxerxes
In the royal court, the cupbearer would test the wine before it was given to the king
to protect him from poisoning
But this position also meant he had the king's ear as a trusted advisor
Nehemiah's integrity, administrative gifts, and wisdom made him a confidant to his ruler, which paved the way for the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem
Like Nehemiah, each of us has been given a unique sphere of influence
Raising children, church or community work, and employment all provide a platform where we can have a beneficial effect on others
Has the Lord placed someone in your life upon whom you can have an influence?
As a child, I learned to behave properly when adults rewarded my good behavior and punished my bad behavior
This worked pretty well because the reward or punishment generally came quickly after the behavior
making the relationship between the cause and effect unmistakable
When I became an adult, however, life got more complex, and the consequences of my actions were not always immediate
When I behaved badly without getting in trouble for it, I began to think that it didn't matter to God what I did
Something similar happened to the children of Israel
When they disobeyed God and didn't suffer any bad consequences right away, they said, 'The Lord has forsaken the land, and the Lord does not see!'
, indicating their belief that God had lost interest in them and didn't care about their bad behavior
But they were wrong
Weary of their waywardness, God finally said, 'None of My words will be delayed any longer; whatever I say will be fulfilled'
When God delays discipline, it's not due to indifference; it's due to His very nature
He is gracious and slow to anger
Some see that as permission to sin, but God intends it to be an invitation to repent .
You may be familiar with the list of seven deadly sins that was formulated during the sixth century: lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, vengeance, envy, and pride
But you may not know that the original list compiled during the fourth century also included the sin of sadness
Over the years, that emotion was omitted from the inventory
Some people are blessed with a cheerful disposition
They always seem to be happy
They wear a perpetual smile almost as if they were advertising toothpaste
But then there are others who seem to be chronically sad
They continually complain about life and its burdens
And who can deny that afflictions are discouraging
While we acknowledge that not everybody is blessed with a bright outlook on life, we need to remember that joy is one of the gifts Jesus promised to His followers
And we need to resist any tendency to let sadness dominate our emotional lives
Jesus promised His disciples on the night Judas betrayed Him, 'Your joy no one will take from you'
Remember that joy is the fruit of the indwelling Holy Spirit
Let's ask the Lord to help us look beyond our sorrowful circumstances and encourage our hearts by the vision of joy that awaits us .
When a teenager named Poh Fang learned about Jesus' love for her and received Him as her Savior, her parents weren't sure about the merits of Christianity
So they sent her older sister with her to church to keep an eye on her
But something happened that they didn't expect
The powerful Word of God penetrated the heart of the older sister, and she accepted Jesus as her Savior as well
The psalmist said of the Word of God, 'Your precepts have given me life'
That's the testimony of Poh Fang and her sister and of all who know Christ as Savior
His Word is 'powerful and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart'
God's Word shows us our sin and its consequences: 'All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God'
the wages of sin is death
It tells us of God's love and salvation: 'God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, made us alive together with Christ '
And it gives wisdom for daily living: 'Your Word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path'
Thank You, Lord, for Your powerful Word, which gives us life and direction for daily living.
Have you ever felt like giving up
Elijah did
The Lord had just used him to show the nation of Israel that the Lord is God
Yet, the threats of Queen Jezebel so alarmed him that he ran to Beersheba, 100 miles south
Then he walked another 150 miles south to Horeb, the mountain of God
Twice God asked Elijah what he was doing there
Both times he answered with identical words I alone am left; and they seek to take my life'
He had become so preoccupied with his own fears that he had forgotten what God had done through him at Mount Carmel
Despite his great victory, Elijah plunged into the depths of discouragement
How easy it is for us to do the same
God did not accept Elijah's notice that he was quitting
Instead, He commissioned his tired servant to handle three major tasks
And by the way, Elijah was wrong when he said he was the only faithful one left
God had 7,000 others who had not bowed to Baal
Perhaps, like Elijah, you are despairing at the circumstances in your life
Let God speak to you
Instead of allowing you to quit, He will show you what you can do through His strength.
It would have been simpler just to buy a new hair dryer
But determined to save a buck, I decided to fix it myself
In order to loosen the screw that was buried deep in the handle, I took out the ultimate handyman's helper my pocket knife
As I put pressure on the knife to turn the screw, the blade folded back on my finger
I learned a lesson that day: I love myself
And I am urgent about meeting my needs
There was no thought of, 'Well, I don't really have time to stop the bleeding now
I'll get to it later.
Also, there was a tenderness about how the need was met
I instructed my first-aid team to wash my finger gently and then to put the bandage on in a way that would avoid having the hairs on my finger pulled up when it was removed
My thoughts, words, and actions were driven by my love for myself
To love 'your neighbor as yourself' requires the same urgent kind of love
It's a love that notices the need of another person and won't rest until it's been met
It's a gentle, tender love that thinks and acts carefully
It's the sacrificial and compassionate love that a nameless Samaritan had for a fallen traveler
It's the kind of love God wants to share with your neighbors through you.
Imagine being a visitor in a foreign land, showing up unannounced at a gathering of people you have never met and who have never heard of you and then being allowed to address that group just a few minutes later
That can happen only if something breaks down barriers something like mutual friends
It happened when I took a missions team to a church service in Discovery Bay, Jamaica
Before we left the US, my friend Dorant Brown, a Jamaican pastor, recommended a church to attend
So when we arrived at the church, and I mentioned Pastor Brown, we were not only welcomed, but I was also asked to speak briefly and our team was asked to sing
While sharing Dorant's name was vital, I really don't think it was that mutual friend who got us such a warm welcome
I think it was our shared Friend and Savior Jesus who opened our Jamaican friends' hearts to our visit
Have you experienced a connection with someone you just met when you tell them you too know Jesus
He's a friend who laid down His life for us , and He makes brothers and sisters of all who believe
Jesus
Our Savior
Our mutual Friend
He joins hearts around the world under the banner of His love.
At the age of 16, pianist Leon Fleisher made his formal debut at Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic
He went on to win prestigious international competitions and played in the world's finest concert halls
But at the age of 37, Fleisher was struck with dystonia, a neurological condition that crippled his right hand
After a period of despondency and withdrawal, he turned to teaching and conducting, because, as he said, he loved music more than he loved the piano
When our dreams are shattered, how do we react
After Joseph, the favored son of Jacob, was sold as a slave by his brothers , he could have given in to self-pity and self-indulgence
Instead, Joseph remained true to the Lord
Four times in Genesis 39, we read that 'the Lord was with' Joseph , and his actions revealed his own faithfulness to God
By his exemplary life, those he served in Egypt recognized God's presence with him
Do we love God more than our own dreams
Although Joseph must have grieved the loss of his past and what his life could have been, the Lord led him to a calling he had never imagined
Today, the Lord longs to lead us
Are we willing to be redirected by Him?
Then Jesus told a parable about a man who harvested a bumper crop and began to make plans to increase and enjoy his riches
He concluded, God said to him, Fool This night your soul will be required of you; then whose will those things be which you have provided
So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God
The trouble with greed is that ultimately our goods go
But worse we go
Better to store up treasure in heaven, invest in spiritual riches, and become 'rich toward God.'
In the normal course of providence, God works in and through creation, not despite it
For this reason, some answers to prayer are difficult to prove with certainty
'Only faith vouches for the connection,' C S Lewis writes
'No empirical proof could establish it.'
We believe a prayer has been answered not because of any scientific criteria proving it, but because we have faith
Most of the ways we encounter God nature, the Bible, the Lord's Supper, the church, other people include things we can touch
God's own state, though, is the realm of spirit
Prayer reflects that difference between us
Although we may ask God to intervene directly, it should not surprise us if He responds in a more hidden way in cooperation with our own choices
An alcoholic prays, 'Lord, keep me from drink today.'
The answer to that prayer will likely come from the inside from a stiffening resolve or a cry for help to a loyal friend rather than from some marvel like the magical disappearance of liquor bottles from a cabinet
Whether God supernaturally intervenes or is giving us the power to obey Him, we trust His character
We see a true partnership, intimate and intertwined.
If there were a contest for most popular virtue, I suspect that 'fast' would beat 'best.'
Many parts of the world seem to be obsessed with speed
The 'fast' craze, however, is getting us nowhere, fast
'The time has come to challenge our obsession with doing everything more quickly,' says Carl Honore in his book In Praise of Slowness
'Speed is not always the best policy.'
According to the Bible, he's right
Peter warned that in the last days people would doubt God because it seems He is slow in fulfilling His promise to return
Peter pointed out, however, that this seeming slowness is a good thing
God is actually demonstrating His patience by giving people more time to repent , and also being true to His character, as in patient or slow to anger
We too must be slow to become angry and slow to speak
According to James, 'quickness' is reserved for our ears
We're supposed to be quick to listen
Think about how much trouble we could avoid if we learned to listen really listen, not just stop talking before we speak
In our rush to meet goals and deadlines, let's remember to speed up our listening and to slow down our tempers and our tongues.
The university where I teach as an adjunct professor provides laptop computers for its students
While this can be an aid to the students in many ways, I have discovered one way it hinders learning: The laptops can become a distraction during class
Because the students take notes on their laptops, they have them open on their desks during class
The problem is that they find texting their friends, visiting Facebook, or checking things on the Internet more interesting than my lectures
A laptop loses value in the learning environment if it becomes a distraction even if what the students are doing is positive
Good things can do that
Things that have value can draw our attention away from what we should be paying attention to
This was true for Martha
Luke 10:40 says she was 'distracted with much serving,'
which took her away from spending time with Jesus
In the same way, a good hobby can have value in and of itself
But if it distracts you from your family responsibilities or relationship with God, some changes are needed
Are life's good options distracting you from what your primary priorities should be
Return, as Jesus told Martha, to what 'is needed.'
The documentary In the Shadow of the Moon includes the story of Charlie Duke, one of the Apollo 16 astronauts launched to the moon in 1972
While the command ship orbited the moon, Duke and another astronaut landed the lunar module Orion on the moon's surface
After 3 days of running experiments and collecting lunar rocks, the Apollo 16 crew safely returned to earth
Later, Charlie had a spiritual transformation
He said it began when his friend invited him to a Bible study
After the meeting, Charlie prayed to Christ, 'I give You my life, and if You're real come into my life.'
He then experienced an indescribable peace
It was so profound that he began to share his story with others
Charlie told them, 'My walk on the moon lasted 3 days and it was a great adventure, but my walk with God lasts forever.'
The Bible tells us of another man who walked with God
'Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him'
His spiritual walk with God was so close that God took him directly into eternity
We can learn a lesson from Charlie and Enoch
For believers, no matter where our journey leads, our walk with God will last for eternity!
In the quietness of my final years I plan to watch a tree grow a birch tree I planted as a tiny sapling over 30 years ago
It stands now in mature splendor, just outside our picture window beautiful in every season of the year
So it is with our spiritual endeavors: We may have planted, watered, and fussed over our 'saplings' for a time, but only God can make a 'tree.'
Occasionally I hear from those I ministered to years ago, and discover to my delight that they have grown to maturity and have been greatly used of God with no help from me
It's a gentle reminder that I plant and water for a while, and help others 'grow up in all things into Him who is the head Christ'
But only God 'gives the increase'
German theologian Helmut Thielicke writes, 'The man who doesn't know how to let go, who is a stranger to quiet, confident joy in Him who carries out His purposes without us , in Him who makes the trees grow
that man will become nothing but a miserable creature in his old age.'
So, at my age, I may yet tend a sapling or two, but mostly I will let go and watch them grow.
On a trip through Chicago, I saw a poster advertising a business management seminar
The poster's message was intriguing: The Value of a Leader Is Directly Proportional to That Leader's Values
The accuracy of that statement struck me
What we value shapes our character and will ultimately define how we lead, or whether we can lead at all
This does not apply only to leaders, however
For the follower of Christ, values are even more significant
When Paul wrote to the believers at Colosse, he said, 'Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth'
His point is that only as we allow our values to be motivated and shaped by the eternal will we be effective ambassadors of Christ in the world
It is in the understanding that we are pilgrims in this world, not tourists
that we can keep a clear perspective and an undistracted heart and can more effectively serve the Savior
It has been said that we live in a world that knows the cost of everything but the value of nothing
In this world of the 'here and now,' however, followers of Christ are called to build our values around what lasts forever
To say it another way: The Effectiveness of a Believer Is Directly Proportional to That Believer's Values.
A man who has been my mentor and friend for many years often says that his goal in studying the Bible is always personal application
I appreciate his emphasis on putting learning into practice, because it's too easy for those of us who study, discuss, teach, and write about the Bible to take a merely intellectual approach to the Word
Oswald Chambers said: 'There is a danger with the children of God of getting too familiar with sublime things
We talk so much about these wonderful realities, and forget that we have to exhibit them in our lives
It is perilously possible to mistake the exposition of the truth for the truth; to run away with the idea that because we are able to expound these things, we are living them too.'
James reminds us that the person 'who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does'
The key issue is not what is preached or written, but what is done
When I study God's Word, my first question should not be, 'What am I going to say about this?'
but 'What am I going to do about this?'?
A friend once told me, 'In my lifetime I've seen a lot of things change, and I've been against them all!'
Perhaps he overstated the point, but many of us would agree that we don't like change especially if it involves altering our habits and attitudes
That's one reason Jesus was so unpopular among the Pharisees
He challenged their long-established system of good works and self-righteous living
Consider the incident when the town 'sinner' entered the home of the town 'saint' in Luke 7
Simon the Pharisee wasn't impressed with the woman's lavish display of affection for Jesus
Reading Simon's self-righteous thoughts, Jesus immediately challenged his flawed perception of his own goodness 
Jesus told the story of two debtors one who owed much to his master and one who owed less
'Which of them will love him more?'
Jesus asked
Obviously, the one who had been forgiven more
Speaking to Simon's I-feel-pretty-good-about-myself attitude, Jesus said, 'to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little'
The challenge is clear
Lulled into thinking how good we are, our love for Jesus wanes because we have forgotten that we too are among the ones 'forgiven much.'
And when that happens, ready or not, it's time for a change!
Last January, ESPN television ran a compelling feature about Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning
He had just been named the NFL's Most Valuable Player
But the feature was not about football
Instead, it explained that for several years, when certain competitors Manning admired were retiring from the NFL, he took time to handwrite a note to them, congratulating them on their careers and their character
Each recipient who was interviewed expressed deep appreciation that one of the greatest players of all time would do that
It was a great reminder of the power of the written word
While a written note from a respected athlete such as Peyton Manning has much value, no human's words can compare with the written Word we have from God in Scripture
Paul wrote, 'Whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope'
In the life-changing wisdom of the Bible, we have a personal message that tells us what God desires for us to be and what He desires to be for us
He has given us His written Word so we 'might have hope' as we face the issues of life
Out of gratitude, let's read God's written message and watch it change our lives.
A friend of mine has the opportunity each winter to attend the Super Bowl as a journalist
His job is to garner interviews with Christian athletes and National Football League personnel for a faith-based radio program
When he first started covering the big game a few years ago, he grew disillusioned with the self-serving, pleasure-seeking atmosphere during Super Bowl week
'I found it to be a very dark place,' he says
One day he told a former NFL player, a Christian, how he was feeling
The athlete looked at my friend and said, 'Brother, you are being light in this dark place.'
That comment reminded my friend why he was there, and it helped renew his excitement for serving God in a place where the light of the gospel is needed
It spurred him to shine his light
Perhaps you work in a setting where God is not acknowledged, faith is mocked, and godless living is applauded
Maybe you feel that you are going into 'a very dark place.'
Why not be a light through your smiles, kind words and deeds, and diligent work
Ask God to bring opportunities to share the good news of Jesus Christ
You may be the only light a co-worker sees today.
Pastor and author Erwin Lutzer wrote: 'One minute after you slip behind the parted curtain, you will either be enjoying a personal welcome from Christ or catching your first glimpse of gloom as you have never known it
Either way, your future will be irrevocably fixed and eternally unchangeable.'
Luke recorded a short yet powerful narrative that pictures two men about to go behind that curtain of death
When Jesus was being crucified, two thieves hung alongside Him
According to Mark, both men hurled insults at Jesus
One of the thieves, however, had a change of heart as he realized Jesus' innocence, his own sin, and his destiny
He rebuked the other thief
He asked Jesus to remember him when He came into His kingdom
These words were a sign of repentance and simple faith
Jesus responded, 'I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise'
Salvation for the man was immediate
It reminded me of how often I needlessly rehearse my disappointments and problems to others instead of telling them to God
The psalmist wrote: 'Trust in Him at all times, you people; pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us'
Twice he spoke of waiting silently for God, his rock and salvation
I'll never forget my first experience using an automatic car wash
Approaching it with the dread of going to the dentist
I pushed the money into the slot, nervously checked and rechecked my windows, eased the car up to the line, and waited
Powers beyond my control began moving my car forward as if on a conveyor belt
There I was, cocooned inside, when a thunderous rush of water, soap, and brushes hit my car from all directions
What if I get stuck in here or water crashes in
I thought irrationally
Suddenly the waters ceased
After a blow-dry, my car was propelled into the outside world again, clean and polished
In the midst of all this, I remembered stormy times in my life when it seemed I was on a conveyor belt, a victim of forces beyond my control
'Car-wash experiences,' I now call them
I remembered that whenever I passed through deep waters my Redeemer had been with me, sheltering me against the rising tide
When I came out on the other side, which I always did, I was able to say with joy and confidence, 'He is a faithful God!'
Are you in the middle of a car-wash experience
Trust God to bring you through to the other side
You'll then be a shining testimony of His keeping power.
San Francisco and New York City are using bluegill fish to check for the presence of toxins in their water supply, which could be a possible target for a terrorist attack
A small number of bluegills are kept in a tank at the bottom of some water treatment plants because the fish are sensitive to chemical imbalances in their environment
When a disturbance is present in the water, the bluegills react against it
Like these bluegills, Paul wanted the Galatians to beware of and react against any toxic disturbance in the 'true gospel' that was being preached
The toxin was defined as the false principle that God grants acceptance to people and considers them righteous on the basis of their obedience to a set of rules
In short, obedience to the law was needed, apart from faith in Jesus
This false teaching was a toxic disturbance of the truth and the Galatians were told to react strongly against it
Paul said that anyone preaching a gospel that is not based on grace through faith in Christ alone should be accursed
Let's faithfully study the Scriptures so we can detect the toxins of false teaching and proclaim the truth of God's wonderful salvation through faith in Jesus.
During the Great Depression, many people in the US lived in shantytowns made up of plywood, tarps, and blankets
These decrepit dwellings, known as 'Hoovervilles,' housed those who had been evicted from their homes
Many blamed President Herbert Hoover for the economic woes
Ironically, Hoover's apparent ineffectiveness as a leader was in sharp contrast to his previous record
Earlier, Hoover's expertise in geological engineering led to successful mining projects in Australia and China
He also effectively spearheaded humanitarian efforts
But when the stock market crashed in October 1929, President Hoover was in circumstances beyond his control
He would be forever tied with the economic depression of the 1930s
One major fiasco, however, does not mean one's whole life is a failure
What if we remembered Abraham only as a deceiver , Moses as disobedient to God , or David as a murderer
Despite their sins, these men are remembered for their persevering faith: 'who through faith
out of weakness were made strong'
Our life is not a failure if we've repented of our sins
God can still use us to serve Him.
Chinese New Year happens to fall on the same day as Valentine's Day in 2010
While these two festivals have very different origins, there are some similarities in how they are celebrated
In both cases, loved ones give gifts to express love for one another
Whether it is giving roses to your beloved on Valentine's Day or hong bao to family and friends on Chinese New Year, they represent tokens of love
Our Lord Jesus Christ commanded His disciples to 'love one another,'
because 'by this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another'
The love that our Lord wants His disciples to have for one another is different from the romantic kind displayed between loving couples and the brotherly kind shown between friends or family
It's an unselfish love
The Greek word John used in Jesus' command is agape God's kind of love that expects nothing in return
That was what Jesus showed to His disciples when He 'poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet'
That is the kind of love He displayed when He went to the cross for us
Today, look for someone to whom you can show such unselfish love.
Many Chinese go to great lengths to attend a traditional annual reunion dinner with their families
Held on the eve of the Lunar New Year, the reunion dinner usually takes place at the home of their parents or eldest sibling
Chinese working overseas have to arrange their travel bookings early to ensure they have tickets
To fail to book early is to risk missing out on the family reunion
The Bible tells of an even more important reunion dinner in heaven
Revelation 19:9 calls it 'the marriage supper of the Lamb.'
Unlike the Lunar New Year reunion dinner, however, no one knows the date for this event except God
Nor do we have to worry about making travel arrangements
Who is invited to this heavenly reunion dinner
All those who belong to God's family will be there, 'those who believe in [Jesus'] name: who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God'
Will you be at the reunion dinner in heaven
You can secure your place at the heavenly banquet by trusting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior today.
American businessman Mark Bent has spent $250,000 to develop and manufacture an affordable solar-powered flashlight
Thousands have been distributed free or at low cost to people living in African refugee camps
One daily solar charge provides 7 hours of life-giving illumination for people in homes, schools, and medical clinics where darkness had encouraged crime and violence
The contrast between darkness and light is a prominent image in the Bible's presentation of Jesus the Messiah
'The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them a light has shined'
'In [Jesus] was life, and the life was the light of men
And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it'
It's our privilege as followers of Jesus to be His light-bearers today
Paul urged the Christians in Philippi to become 'blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world'
Instead of being afraid or oppressed by the spiritual darkness around us, we can rely on the grace that God gives His children to shine for Him.
When someone said to my friend, 'See you in a year,' it sounded odd when he replied, 'Yes, see you on the other side.'
He meant that he'd see him on the other side of a one-year deployment for the US Navy
But because the phrase is often used of heaven, it made me think about the uncertainty of life
I wondered, Who will be here in another year
Who might by then be on the other side in heaven
We certainly don't know what the next year or hour will bring
In his epistle, James wrote about this uncertainty
He rebuked the greedy merchants for boasting about what they would do that day, the next day, or even the next year
Their sin wasn't that they were making plans; it was forgetting God and arrogantly boasting about those business plans
James reminded them: 'What is your life
It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away'
Commentator Peter Davids says that James was pointing out their foolishness and saying, in essence, 'Come now, you who make plans you don't even understand how little control you have over life itself.'
No part of life is outside the control of God
So when we make plans, we need to remember, 'If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that'
I watch the fluctuations of the stock market and reflect on the effects of fear and greed
A character in a 1980s movie had this philosophy: 'Greed, for lack of a better word, is good
Greed is right
Greed works
Greed [will] save
the USA!'
What foolish thinking
I think of that occasion when a man asked Jesus to serve as an arbiter and make his brother share their inheritance
Jesus refused the request but went on to do the man a greater kindness
He pointed out the motive behind the man's request and its consequences: 'Take heed and beware of covetousness, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses'
Dr Scott Kurtzman, chief of surgery at Waterbury Hospital in Connecticut
He was on his way to deliver a lecture when he witnessed a horrible crash involving 20 vehicles
The doctor shifted into trauma mode, worked his way through the mess of metal, and called out, 'Who needs help?'
After 90 minutes of assisting, and the victims were taken to area hospitals, Dr Kurtzman commented, 'A person with my skills simply can't drive by someone who is injured
I refuse to live my life that way.'
Jesus told a parable about a man who stopped to help another
A Jewish man had been ambushed, stripped, robbed, and left for dead
A Jewish priest and a temple assistant passed by, saw the man, and crossed over to the other side
Then a despised Samaritan came by
He saw the man, and was filled with compassion
His compassion was translated into action: He soothed and bandaged the man's wounds, took him to an inn, cared for him while he could, paid for all his medical expenses, and then promised the innkeeper he would return to pay any additional expenses
There are people around us who are suffering
Moved with compassion for their pain, let's be those who stop to help.
In June 2009, 95-year-old Emma Gray died
For over two decades, she had been the cleaning lady in a big house
Each night as she did her work, she prayed for blessings, wisdom, and safety for the man she worked for
Although Emma worked in the same place for 24 years, the occupants of the residence changed every 4 years or so
Over the years, Emma offered her nightly prayers for six US Presidents: Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter
Emma had her personal favorites, but she prayed for them all
She followed the instruction we read in 1 Timothy 2 to pray for 'all who are in authority'
The verses go on to speak of how living 'a quiet and peaceable life'
and being a godly and reverent person 'is good and acceptable in the sight of God
who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth'
Because God 'hears the prayer of the righteous'
, who knows how He used Emma's faithful prayers
In Proverbs 21:1, we read: 'The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord, like the rivers of water; He turns it wherever He wishes.'
Like Emma, we are to pray for our leaders
Is there someone God is calling you to pray for today?
Not fair!'
Whether you've said it or at least thought it, you've got to admit, it's hard to see someone get away with something and not get what they deserve
We learn this early in life
Just ask the parent of any teenager
Kids hate to see their siblings get off scot-free for the things they got spanked for
Which is why they so readily tattle on each other
But then, we never really grow out of this
To our way of thinking, fairness means sinners deserve God's wrath and we, the good people, deserve His applause
But if God were into being 'fair,'
we would all be consumed by His judgment
We can be thankful for this: '[God] has not dealt with us according to our sins'
We should be glad, not grumpy, that God chooses mercy over fairness and that He is willing to extend grace even to those who are undeserving and hopelessly lost
And while we are thinking about it, when was the last time we let mercy trump fairness with someone who offended us
It's not God's fairness but His mercy that drives Him to pursue us so that heaven can have a party when we are found
Personally, I'm thankful that God has not been 'fair' with me
Recently I was fishing with some friends and waded into a current that was too strong for my old legs
I should have known better; it's a well-known fact that you can wade into flows that you can't back out of
I got that panicky feeling you get when you realize you're in deep trouble
One more step and I would have been swept away
I did the only thing I could think of: I called out to a friend nearby who is younger and stronger than I
'Hey, Pete!'
'Give me a hand, will you?'
My friend waded into the current, reached out his strong hand, and pulled me into quiet water
A few days later as I read Psalm 119, I came across verse 173: 'Let Your hand become my help.'
I thought of that day on the stream and other days when I have 'waded'
into difficult situations, overestimating my feeble abilities and putting myself or my loved ones in jeopardy
Perhaps you find yourself in that place today
There is help nearby, a Friend much stronger than you and I, one whose hand can hold us
The psalmist also says of Him, 'You have a mighty arm; strong is Your hand'
You can call out to God: 'Give me a hand!'
and He will rush to your side.
Last week I had several opportunities to show grace
I wasn't perfect, but I was pleased with the way I handled one situation in particular
Instead of getting angry, I said, 'I understand how that could have happened
I've certainly made my share of mistakes,'
and I left it at that
According to my own grading scale, I deserved a high score
Not perfect, but close
Lurking in the back of my mind was the thought that maybe by being gracious I could expect to be treated that way at some future date
The following Sunday morning our congregation was singing 'Amazing Grace,'
and suddenly the audacity of my attitude came through to me in the words, 'Amazing grace How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.'
What in the world was I thinking?
The grace we show to others is not our own
The only reason we can 'give' grace to anyone is because God has already given it to us
We can pass along only that which we have received from Him
Good stewards look for opportunities to pass along to others what we have received from the Lord
May all of us be 'good stewards of the manifold grace of God'
Corporal Desmond Doss was the first conscientious objector to earn the Congressional Medal of Honor, the United States' highest military award
A devout follower of Christ, Doss believed that it was not right for him to kill others, but he wanted to serve his country so he volunteered as a medic
During boot camp, his fellow soldiers ridiculed him for refusing to fire a rifle
They mocked him when he read his Bible and knelt beside his bunk at night to pray
But in combat, it was a different story
During the World War II battle for Okinawa in May 1945, Doss repeatedly risked his life to rescue scores of wounded men
Through his unselfish actions, he earned the gratitude and respect of his former critics and of those whose lives he saved
In the face of unjust criticism, Peter told his fellow Christians, 'Even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed
'\sAnd do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled'
He urged them to honor God in their hearts and be ready to give a respectful reply to anyone who asked about the hope within them
May our response to a hurting world that's often hostile to Christ be one that demonstrates God's love.
One of the great privileges of serving at Moody Bible Institute was hearing about graduates who had impacted the world for Christ
Their stories of sacrifice, perseverance, and passion for the gospel were inspiring
In the late 19th century, Mary McLeod Bethune spent 2 years studying at Moody in Chicago, training to become a missionary in Africa
But after she graduated, no mission board would give her the opportunity, as an African-American woman, to serve on the mission field
Unable to fulfill her dream to go to Africa, she didn't give up on her calling to serve Jesus
Undaunted, she started a small school for African-American girls in Florida that would eventually blossom into Bethune-Cookman College
She became a powerful force for change in the status of women
Mary's legacy was forged by her determination to serve Jesus even in the face of shattered dreams
She knew that God had entrusted to her 'the ministry of reconciliation'
, and she wouldn't give up
That wasn't just a mandate for Mary McLeod Bethune
Telling people they can be reconciled to God through Christ is a calling given to all of us
Look for a way to make a difference for Jesus today, right where you are!
Answering media charges of scandal and impropriety, the guilty politician responded with the plea, 'I have no recollection of those events.'
It was yet another attempt of a public figure to apply a strategy called 'plausible deniability.'
This is when individuals try to create a personal safety net for themselves by seeking to convince others that they had no knowledge of the events in question
Someone else gets blamed and becomes the scapegoat for the guilty person's wrongs
Sometimes Christians have their own kind of plausible deniability
We claim ignorance of our wrong behavior, rationalize, or blame others, but God knows the truth
The Bible tells us: 'Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart'
This is true whether the heart is pure or if it's a corrupt heart robed in false claims of innocence
We may fool others who see us only on the outside, but God sees the reality of our hearts, whether good or bad
It is wise, therefore, to humbly confess our faults to the Lord
He desires that we admit the truth
The only way to escape the sin and restore our fellowship with God is to acknowledge and confess it to Him .
Matt Emmons, Olympic gold medalist in rifle shooting in 2004, was set to win another event at Athens
He had a commanding lead and hoped to make a direct bull's-eye on his last shot
But something went wrong, he hit the target, but he was aiming at the wrong one
That wrong focus dropped him to eighth place and cost him a medal
In Paul's letter to the Philippians, he expressed the importance of focusing on the right target in our Christian life
'I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus,' he said
Paul used the term 'goal'
in an illustration of an athlete running a race
Interestingly, the same word was also used of a target for shooting arrows
In both cases, the prospect of winning depends on being focused
For the believer that focus should be a lifetime pursuit of becoming more like our Savior Jesus Christ
What is your focus today
Are you preoccupied with getting ahead and making life more comfortable
If you're a believer, the right target to shoot for is to become more like the Son of God
Today make sure you are aiming at the right target!
For most English-speaking people, the acronym ASAP means 'As Soon As Possible'
or immediately
But for the Christian it can also mean, 'Always Say A Prayer.'
King Hezekiah was one of Judah's best kings
He restored the worship of God to his nation after his father Ahaz's evil reign
Yet when the Assyrian king attacked Judah, Hezekiah capitulated to the king and stripped off the gold from the temple in Jerusalem to placate him
That did not satisfy the Assyrian king, however, who returned to issue another threat
It was then that Hezekiah turned to the Lord
He prayed, 'You are God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth
Save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are the Lord God, You alone'
When Hezekiah prayed, God answered him in a remarkable way and delivered him from his enemies
You may be facing a problem that leaves you feeling helpless
It may be the loss of a job, a difficult family or work situation, or health struggles
We have a powerful God to whom we can bring our concerns
So before you do anything else, remember to ASAP, Always Say A Prayer.
An African proverb states, 'The one who asks questions doesn't lose his way.'
That concept can be helpful as we consider David's questions in the Psalms
He was clearly seeking God's guidance for the way he should go
Look, for example, at some of the questions he asked: 'O Lord, how long?'
A question of eagerness to see God's plan accomplished
'What is man that You are mindful of him?'
A question of awe that God even cares about sinful man
'Why do You hide in times of trouble?'
A question that reveals a longing for God's presence
'Lord, who may abide in Your tabernacle
Who may dwell in Your holy hill?'
The ultimate question of who may live with God
David had some tough questions for God
He had discovered what it was like to lose his way when he excluded God and followed his own sinful path
But as he penned the Psalms, he was a man in search of godliness, which meant he probed God's mind about difficult subjects
Questions Like David, you have them
Keep asking
Then, through faith in God's Word and the work of the Holy Spirit, listen as He leads you in His way.
Every Memorial Day, we remember those who have died in the service of their country
In the United States, a place where such remembrances carry a deep and emotional significance is Arlington National Cemetery, near Washington, DC
Arlington is a serious place where, due to the passing of aging war veterans and the ongoing conflicts around the world
there are currently about 25 military funerals every day
This is particularly difficult for The Old Guard members of the 3rd US Infantry Regiment who serve at Arlington
It is their task to bear the bodies of the fallen and honor their sacrifice
The members of The Old Guard never forget the price of liberty for they are reminded of it every day
Believers in Christ have been given the Lord's Supper as a reminder of what our freedom from sin cost the Lord Jesus Christ
As we partake of the bread and the cup, we fulfill His command to 'do this in remembrance of Me'
But in the sober celebration of the sacrifice of Christ there is joy
For we need not leave our remembrances at the Lord's Table
Living our lives for the Savior can show the world that we will never forget the sacrifice He has made for us.
Today's technology allows some people to work 24/7
We can bring our work home or take it on vacation
Work is ever-present with us, except when the electricity goes off
An ice storm last winter covered several states in a thick glasslike glaze
Trees and branches fell, blocking roads and keeping people home
Power lines fell, leaving people in cold darkness
The are unable to accomplish anything that required electricity
Whenever something like this interrupts my life, I realize how important my own work is to me
Without it, I feel unimportant, unproductive, and useless
But God doesn't want work to be that important to us, and we shouldn't need a power outage to get us to stop
In the Old Testament, God had a plan for getting His people to stop and pay attention to Him
It was called Sabbath
On the seventh day of the week, they were to stop their work
Although New Testament believers aren't required to keep this law, rest is still important
Practicing a day of rest can keep us from the faulty belief that our work is more important than God's
What does it take to make you stop and pay attention to God?
While a friend and I walked along the path of the former Berlin Wall, he told me, 'This is one of those '\snever say never' places in my life.'
He explained that during the years when the Wall divided the city, he had made a dozen trips through Checkpoint Charlie to encourage members of the church living under continuing surveillance and opposition in East Germany
More than once, he had been detained, questioned, and harassed by the border guards
In 1988, he took his teenage children to West Berlin and told them, 'Take a good look at this wall, because someday when you bring your children here, this wall will still be standing.'
A year later it was gone
When Saul of Tarsus began to attack the followers of Jesus, no one could have imagined that he would ever become a disciple of Christ
'Never
Not a chance.'
Yet Acts 9:1-9 records the story of Saul's blinding encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus
Within a few days of that life-changing event, Saul was preaching in the synagogues of Damascus that Jesus was the Son of God, to the astonishment of all who heard him
When it comes to God's work in the most difficult people we know, we should never say 'never.'
In a message to the 2002 graduates of Cedarville University, Dr Paul Dixon encouraged them with these words: 'Your times are in God's hands.'
Our family listened and thought it was appropriate for the graduates, which included our daughter Julie
We had no idea that in 5 days our 17-year-old Melissa would graduate to heaven through a car accident and we would be left to recall with new meaning that thought from Psalm 31:15
Over the years, we have become painfully aware that in God's mysterious ways, He has planned for some Christians a life that is short
I think of one young Christian girl, the kind with a smile for everyone, who had a sore finger and a week later was dead from a raging infection
Or the young believer who was killed while playing softball when a ball hit her in the neck
Or the teen boy who loved Jesus and fishing
and died when a car hit him as he rode his bike home from the fishing hole
Melissa, Heather, Maggie, and Thomas
In their short lives, they created a legacy of faith in Jesus and love for others
They were ready when His time for them had come
'I trust in You,' the psalmist said
recognizing that his life was in God's hands alone
Are you trusting God for whatever comes next on your calendar?
In her fascinating book Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise, Ruth Reichl reflects on her 6 years as a New York Times restaurant critic
Because she was the most influential critic in the country, top restaurants posted her photograph so their employees could recognize her
Hoping to earn a high rating in the New York Times, the staff intended to provide her with their top service and best cuisine
In response, Reichl developed a clever strategy
Hoping to be treated as a regular patron, she disguised herself
On one occasion, she dressed up as an old woman
The restaurant made her wait a long time to be seated and then was unresponsive to her requests
In the early church, James spoke out against favoritism: '[If] you pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and say to him, '\sYou sit here in a good place,' and say to the poor man, '\sYou stand there,' or, '\sSit here at my footstool,' have you not shown partiality among yourselves?'
When people attend our churches, are they treated impartially
Or do we show favoritism to the wealthy or elite
God calls us to show concern for and interest in all people, regardless of their social status
Let's welcome all to join us in worshiping the King!
My Australian friend Graham wasn't born blind
He was blinded by a freak accident at age 9
Yet he never felt sorry for himself
Wherever he went, he shared what Jesus Christ meant to him
His last trip was to Thailand as a practicing physiotherapist
Besides using his professional skills there, he wanted to share the gospel of Christ
The four lepers in 2 Kings 7 had some good news to share as well
They had stumbled into the Syrian camp and found it deserted
After helping themselves to the food and loot, they remembered the starving people of Samaria, shut in as a result of a Syrian siege
Their response was: 'We are not doing right
This day is a day of good news, and we remain silent'
So they went and told their fellow Israelites about the provisions
Despite their physical and social disadvantages, both Graham and the lepers thought about others
They were thankful for what they had found and considered it too good to keep to themselves
Do you know someone who needs to know what Jesus has done
Don't make excuses for what you lack in abilities
Instead, share the good news of what the Lord has done for you, and your life will take on new purpose.
John Steinbeck's Pulitzer prizewinning novel The Grapes of Wrath begins with a scene in drought-ravaged Oklahoma during the Great Depression
With the crops dying and the land choked by dust, the women watched the men to see if they would break under the strain
When they saw the men's will to carry on, they took heart
Steinbeck writes, 'Women and children knew deep in themselves that no misfortune was too great to bear if their men were whole.'
The issue was not happiness, prosperity, or satisfaction, but wholeness
This is the great need of us all
In the King James Version of the Bible, the word whole is often used to describe Jesus' work of physical healing
When the Lord encountered a man who had been an invalid for 38 years, He asked, 'Wilt thou be made whole?'
After Jesus healed the man, He challenged him to also embrace spiritual wholeness: 'See, you have been made well
Sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon you'
If we only want something Jesus can do for us, our relationship with Him will be limited
When we want Jesus Himself, He brings completeness to our lives
Christ wants, first and foremost, to make us whole.
The Scripture reading from Luke 18 about children seemed unusual at the memorial service for David Holquist
After all, he was 77 when he died
Yet the pastor said the verses fit David, a long-time college professor, perfectly
Part of his legacy was that he took time for children, his own and others'
He made balloon animals and puppets
David also helped in a puppet ministry at church
When planning worship services with others, he frequently asked, 'What about the children?'
He was concerned about what would help the children not just the adults to worship God
Luke 18 shows us the concern Jesus had for children
When people brought little ones to Him, the disciples wanted to protect Jesus, a busy man, from the bothersome children
Just the opposite
The Bible says that Jesus was 'greatly displeased'
at the disciples, and said, 'Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them'
Mark adds that Jesus took them in His arms and blessed them
Let's examine our own attitude about children and then follow the example of David Holquist
Find some ways to help them come to Jesus.
When it comes to communication, our world is becoming increasingly high-tech
The popularity of things like Twitter and Facebook might cause some to think the Bible is too old-school
The tech-savvy people of our world might feel deterred because there are no sounds and no nifty graphics in the Bible
But the truth is, there's more high-tech power in God's Word than in any cutting-edge communication tool our world will ever know
It's not uncommon for a pastor to be told, 'When you said that in your message, it was just what I needed.'
Somehow during the sermon, God spoke to the person's heart with a message tailor-made for him or her
If you've ever read the Bible and sensed God speaking directly to you, you know what I'm talking about
God has hard-wired you with His Spirit, who illumines your mind to understand His Word
Imagine getting a 'text message'
directly from the Creator of the universe telling you exactly what you need at exactly the right time
No matter how high-tech this world gets, you'll never experience a more powerful mode of communication
Rejoice in the reality that 'we have received the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God'
Before they were a week old, the eaglets were fighting over food
Neither was strong enough to hold up his head for more than a few seconds, so the pair looked like fuzzballs with bobble-heads attached
But whenever the parents brought food to the nest, the bigger eaglet was quick to peck down his brother to keep him from getting a single bite
His aggression would have been understandable if food was scarce, or if the parents couldn't be trusted to supply what he needed
But nothing could be further from the truth
The eaglets were being fed fish many times their size; there was more than enough for both of them
The greedy eaglet reminds me of our own foolishness when we try to get for ourselves something that belongs to someone else
Conflicts erupt because we want something that God has given to a friend, colleague, relative, or neighbor
Instead of asking God for what we need, we try to get what He's given to someone else
But God has something good for each of us
We don't need what belongs to anyone else
And we certainly never need to harm anyone to get what we need
Our loving heavenly Father has more than enough for everyone.
In 1970, the Beatles began work on a documentary intended to show how their music was made
But instead of revealing the process of musical creativity, the film pulled the curtain back on a display of self-interest and bickering
The band members were more concerned about their own songs than the advancement of the group
Shortly after the project was completed, the group dissolved in disharmony and broken friendships
It's an age-old problem
In the first century AD, the apostle Paul feared that the believers in the church at Philippi would fall into the trap of selfishness
He knew that when the desire for personal advancement overrides concern for one another, attitudes quickly become disruptive and divisive
To counteract this dangerous tendency, Paul wrote, 'Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit
but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others'
What would a documentary of your life reveal
Selfishness or selflessness
We must look out for one another, for selfless concern will prevent division and build unity in our church families.
I was delighted when a mutual friend gave my neighbor a Bible
But my neighbor told me she stopped reading it because she couldn't understand why God would be so unfair as to reject Cain's offering
'After all,' she said, 'as a farmer, he simply brought to God what he had
Did God expect him to buy a different kind of sacrifice?'
Sadly, she had missed the point
It wasn't that God didn't like vegetables
Rather, He knew that Cain's offering was masking an unrighteous attitude
Cain wasn't fully committed to God, as expressed by the fact that he wasn't living according to His ways
It's easy to worship God on the outside while stubbornly keeping territory from Him on the inside
Jude writes about outwardly religious people who use religious activities to cover the reality of their sinful lives: 'Woe to them For they have gone in the way of Cain'
We can faithfully serve God, sing His praises, and give sacrificially to His work
But God doesn't want any of that without our hearts
Does the Lord take priority over our plans and dreams
Is He worth more than the sin that tempts us
When we express to Him that He is more worthy than anything or anyone else in our lives, it's an offering He won't refuse.
When I was growing up in Singapore, I remember that some of my school friends were kicked out of their homes by their non-Christian parents for daring to believe in Jesus Christ
They suffered for their beliefs and emerged with stronger convictions
By contrast, I was born and raised in a Christian family
Though I didn't suffer persecution, I too had to make my convictions my own
The Israelites who first entered the Promised Land with Joshua saw the mighty acts of God and believed
But sadly, the very next generation 'did not know the Lord nor the work which He had done for Israel'
So it was not long before they turned aside to worship other gods
They didn't make their parents' faith their own
No generation can live off the faith of the previous generation
Every generation needs a firsthand faith
When faced with trouble of any kind, the faith that is not personalized is likely to drift and falter
Those who are second, third, or even fourth generation Christians have a wonderful legacy, to be sure
However, there's no secondhand faith
Find out what God says in His Word and personalize it so that yours is a fresh, firsthand faith .
In 1935, the debate team of Wiley College, a small and unranked black school in Texas, unexpectedly defeated the all-white championship team from the University of Southern California
This was a classic case of the unknown triumphing over a national giant
When ancient Israel was in peril at the hands of the Philistines, there was a boy named David who actually triumphed over a giant
The armies were drawn up on opposite sides of the Valley of Elah
They were probably afraid of one another and decided that the outcome of the battle should be determined by a battle of champions
The Philistines offered Goliath, a giant , but Israel could not find anyone who was worthy or brave enough to fight
David heard of the dilemma and appealed to Saul to let him fight Goliath
Saul was reluctant, but he agreed
David, armed with five smooth stones and unswerving faith in the Almighty God , triumphed over the Philistines' national champion
We all face giants in our lives worry, doubt, fear, sin, and guilt
But with limited and unlikely resources and unswerving confidence in our all-powerful God, we too can triumph over them.
Not long ago, I attended a class in origami
I learned that the term comes from two Japanese words that mean 'folding paper.'
In this process, a piece of paper is transformed into a bird or other unique shape by a series of geometric folds and creases
Our facilitator was Hitoshiro Akehi, a Japanese brother in Christ
As we folded our paper into different shapes, Mr Akehi shared some of his life experiences
The youngest of 11 children, he was raised by his mother after his father died during World War II
Through many twists and turns, his family came into contact with missionaries
As a result, many of his family members became Christians
As I refashioned a simple piece of paper into a beautiful new form, I thought of how God shapes us
First, He uses circumstances to bring us to our knees and to Him
Then, by grace He continues to use life's twists and turns to reshape us into more Christlike persons, 'conformed to the image of His Son'
Has your life taken an unexpected turn
Remember, in the hands of our Creator and Redeemer, we are '[God's] workmanship, created in Christ Jesus'
We are His unfinished works of art
God can use the twists and turns in our lives to make us more like His Son.
When the husband of my longtime friend and publishing colleague collapsed and later died, there was no doubt that life had slipped away from him
There were witnesses
The same was true when Jesus died
But three days later, Jesus was raised from the dead
We have no doubt that this is true because there were witnesses who later saw Him alive
When we gathered for Dave's memorial service, we read familiar passages of Scripture that affirm our hope that he is now enjoying new life in heaven
But we claimed these promises by faith because none of us witnessed Dave go to heaven
There was, however, a witness who saw Jesus in heaven
Not long after witnesses saw Jesus ascend , Stephen saw the heavens open 'and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!'
One of the reasons we know that Jesus spoke the truth about going to prepare a place for us is that He has been seen alive in heaven
When a loved one goes ahead of us to heaven, we feel as if we're being pulled in the opposite direction down into an abyss of sadness
Yet, because God kept His promise to raise Christ and take Him to heaven, we can trust Him to do the same for all who love and follow Him.
When Charles Hayward died last May at the age of 87, he left a legacy for his children and grandchildren
He and his wife Virginia had faithfully served as missionaries for many years both in India and South Africa
But at age 73, he began to select and memorize portions of Scripture so he would 'finish well' with his mind full of God's truth
He called his project, 'The Whole Bible Memorization Plan.'
His children call it, 'Charlie's List.'
Charles chose a theme verse , at least one verse from each Old Testament book, at least one from each New Testament narrative book, and a verse or verses from each chapter of the New Testament Epistles
He began with Genesis 15:6, 'He believed in the Lord, and He accounted it to him for righteousness'
and ended with Revelation 22:17, 'Let him who thirsts come
Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely.'
All in all, Charles committed 239 verses to memory
He reminds me of the psalmist who wrote: 'Your Word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You'
Like Charles, the psalmist meditated and delighted in God's Word
What better goal could any of us have than to fill our minds with God's truth.
In one of Joe Morgenstern's weekly Wall Street Journal columns about movies, he considered the impact of the great film stars in close-up scenes where they said nothing at all
'Movie stars,' he wrote, 'can do as little as they do at crucial moments because, having already earned our respect, they can assume that we're paying attention.'
This quality of powerful silence that we admire in actors and actresses, however, can be frustrating or disappointing in our relationship with God when He is silent
When Lazarus, a close friend of Jesus, became seriously ill, his sisters Mary and Martha sent word to Jesus
But 'when [Jesus] heard that [Lazarus] was sick, He stayed two more days in the place where He was'
Commenting on this passage, Oswald Chambers said: 'Has God trusted you with a silence' a silence that is big with meaning
Think of those days of absolute silence in the home at Bethany
Is there anything analogous to those days in your life
His silence is the sign that He is bringing you into a marvellous understanding of Himself
If God has given you a silence, praise Him, He is bringing you into the great run of His purposes.'
We can trust our loving Lord, even when He is silent.
Some mornings as I leave for work, my wife says to me, 'Don't forget to
Later in the day, she'll phone me and ask, 'Did you forget?'
We all have a tendency to forget
I think that may be why God repeats important truths to us
Twice in Deuteronomy 24, the Lord reminded the Israelites that they were slaves in Egypt but they had been rescued and redeemed by Him
Through Moses, He told them, 'You shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and the Lord your God redeemed you from there'
Because they had been redeemed, the Israelites had certain responsibilities that the Lord wanted them to remember
Moses said, 'I command you to do this thing'
What was 'this thing'?
They were told to care for 'the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow'
If part of the harvest was left in the fields, they were to leave it for these needy people
He reminds them of the people in verses 20 and 21 also
We are redeemed people through Jesus' death on the cross and His resurrection
We too are told numerous times to be willing to share with those in need
Hebrews 13:16 says, 'Do not forget to do good and to share, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.'?
A group of teenagers on a ministry trip in Jamaica were enjoying some downtime with a game of Ultimate Frisbee
But when someone noticed that a boat had overturned off a nearby beach, the game ended and the teens eagerly rushed to the water to help
There they found a small group of professional boat operators struggling with their craft trying to turn it upright
That's where the teens could help
They waded in, put their young strength to work, and together they were able to right the boat
What happened that day in the Caribbean Sea reminds me of what can happen in the church
The 'professionals,' the pastor and others who are trained to lead the church, face a task they can't do alone
It's often a struggle to get the work of the church done until laypeople join in and work alongside the leadership
This was the situation in Acts 6
Some people in the church were being neglected, and the 'professionals,' the apostles who were leading the church, realized they couldn't do everything by themselves
Only when seven laypeople pitched in to help the leaders could the church proceed
How can you come alongside your pastor and other leaders to help keep your church moving ahead?
Cartoonist Scott Adams has become famous for his humorous cartoon strip 'Dilbert.'
He also wrote a book in the 1990s called The Dilbert Principle
In it he mocks technology, leadership fads, and incompetent managers
Many laugh out loud at the connections the book makes with their own work-a-day world
Regarding employee laziness and deceit, the author writes: 'When it comes to avoiding work, it is fair to say I studied with the masters
After nine years
I learned just about everything there is to know about looking busy without actually being busy.'
Believers, however, have a much higher calling when it comes to dealing with employers
In the Scriptures, we are encouraged to exhibit a respectful attitude toward those who supervise us: 'Bondservants, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ; not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart'
The right work ethic begins with a heart of sincerity in which we consider Jesus Christ our employer
We please Him when we diligently serve our boss and others in the workplace.
A couple of weeks ago my wife met a woman who needed a ride
She sensed that this could be from God, so she agreed to take her to her destination
During the ride, the woman revealed to my wife that she was a believer but she struggled with drug addiction
My wife listened to and talked with this hurting woman
As she gave her hope for a better tomorrow, I believe that the woman experienced in some small way a little piece of heaven on earth
When God instructed Moses to build the tabernacle according to His specifications, it was so that God's people would sense His presence
I like to think of it as a little piece of heaven on earth
The temple was a physical example of God's presence on earth also
The purpose of these holy places was for God to dwell among His people
This was God's plan when Jesus, the perfect temple, 'tabernacled' among us
When Jesus ascended to heaven, He sent the Holy Spirit to indwell His followers , so that we would be God's tabernacles and temples in the world
As God's representatives of His presence, let's find ways to bring the peace and hope of heaven to others on earth.
The Chester Beatty Library in Dublin, Ireland, houses a wonderful collection of ancient Bible fragments
One very small fragment is a portion of John 19
This piece of John's gospel describes the moment, as Jesus was being crucified, when He spoke to His mother in a display of love and concern for her
The words are from verse 26, where we read, 'When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, '\sWoman, behold your son!' '
As I stared at that ancient fragment, it struck me afresh how tangible Jesus' love was for His mother and friend
With clear words He let the world know of His love and affection by showing His concern that Mary be cared for by His friend John when He was gone
Hanging on the cross, Jesus said to John, ''\sBehold your mother!' And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home'
I think that today, on this Mother's Day, would be a wonderful time to declare publicly your love for your mom if you still have her or to give thanks to the Lord for her if she is no longer with you
Then show in some tangible ways how much you love her and how much she has meant to you.
When the horrors of war visited the civilians of Nanjing, China, women were not spared in the mounting violence and many were assaulted and killed
In this threatening environment, Minnie Vautrin took heroic measures to protect Chinese women from harm
Serving as a missionary teacher at Ginling College in Nanjing, Minnie cooperated with Chinese nationals, missionaries, surgeons, and business people and turned the college into a 'safety zone,' a place of refuge for thousands of women and girls
In the Bible, we learn that Ruth and her mother-in-law, Naomi, were in need of some protection too
To survive as widows, they had to glean what they could from the harvested fields
As was the custom, Ruth sought a 'kinsman redeemer.'
This was a next of kin or close relative to her deceased husband who would marry her to continue the family line
Boaz was just such a man
He was touched by Ruth's sacrificial care for Naomi and her desire to look for refuge in the Lord
Boaz worked honorably to 'redeem' Ruth and to make her his wife
He then provided for her and Naomi
Our ultimate refuge is in the Lord Himself
Yet He wants to use us as instruments to provide a 'safety zone' for others. 
I have learned much about the conscious remembrance of God from Brother Lawrence, a cook in a 17th-century monastery
In his book The Practice of the Presence of God, Brother Lawrence mentioned practical ways to 'offer God your heart from time to time in the course of the day,'
even in the midst of chores such as cooking or repairing shoes
One's depth of spirituality, said Lawrence, does not depend on changing things you do but rather changing your motive doing for God what you ordinarily do for yourself
One of his eulogies said, 'The good Brother found God everywhere, as much while he was repairing shoes as while he was praying
It was God, not the task, he had in view
He knew that the more the task was against his natural inclinations, the greater was his love in offering it to God.'
That last comment affected my wife deeply
While working with senior citizens in downtown Chicago, she at times was called to do tasks that went beyond her natural inclinations
As she tackled some of the least desirable duties, she reminded herself to keep God and His glory in view
With effort, even the most difficult tasks can be performed and presented as an offering to God .
Historian Cassius Dio recorded a revealing event from the life of Hadrian, the Roman Emperor from ad 117-138
'Once, when a woman made a request of [Hadrian] as he passed by on a journey
he at first said to her, '\sI haven't time,' but afterwards, when she cried out, '\sCease, then, being emperor,' he turned about and granted her a hearing.'
How often we say or hear, 'Not now, I'm busy'
or 'I'm sorry, but I just don't have time.'
Yet, our heavenly Father, the Master and Creator of everything, always has time for us
The psalmist wrote: 'The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their cry
The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears, and delivers them out of all their troubles'
God is not like the emperor or a busy executive who tries to avoid interruption
Instead, the Father's joy is to listen and respond to His children
'The Lord is near to those who have a broken heart, and saves such as have a contrite spirit'
Hadrian's afterthought was, 'I must take time for my subjects.'
God's first thought is, 'I always have time for those who come to Me.'
Whenever we need to talk, the Lord is ready to listen.
We may have secret longings too deep to utter to others perhaps a desire for marriage, or a work or ministry we'd like to perform, or a special place to serve
We must put each desire in God's hands and pray, 'Lord, You must choose for me
I will not choose for myself.'
Genesis 13:10-11 tells us that Lot made his own choice about a desire he had
He 'lifted his eyes and saw all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere like the garden of the Lord
Then Lot chose for himself all the plain of Jordan.'
The plain of Jordan, with its rich soil and copious water supply, looked best to Lot
But the land was polluted with wickedness
Pastor Ray Stedman wrote that 'Lot, presuming to run his own life, '\schose for himself,' and, deceived by what he saw, stumbled blindly into heartache and judgment
Abram, on the other hand, was content to let God choose for him
Abram saw it in its true light.'
Lot chose for himself and lost everything his family, his fortune, his favor with man
It is always the best course for us to let God choose and to follow His direction, knowing as we do that all our heavenly Father's choices are prompted by infinite wisdom and love.
In 1826, the British author Thomas Carlyle married Jane Welsh, who also was an accomplished writer
She dedicated herself to his success and served him wholeheartedly
Because of a stomach ailment and a nervous disorder, he had a rather ornery temperament
So she made special meals for him and tried to keep the house as quiet as possible so he could do his writing
Thomas didn't often recognize Jane's helpful spirit nor did he spend much time with her
However, he wrote this about her to his mother: 'I may say in my heart that she loves me with a devotedness which is a mystery to me how I have ever deserved
She looks with such soft cheerfulness into my gloomy countenance, that new hope passed into me every time I met her eye.'
We too have Someone who loves us with a devotedness that is a mystery how we as sinners ever deserved it
He is God the Father, 'who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all'
His love is wide, long, deep, and high and exceeds our knowledge
Understanding and appreciating God's love is so vital that Paul prayed for the Ephesians to be 'rooted and grounded' in it
May that be our experience as well.
I heard a teenager from a Christian family declare, 'My mom doesn't think swear words are bad.'
He then indicated which words she found acceptable words that have long been considered inappropriate
Society's standard of language has declined in recent years, but we don't have to decline with it
As we strive to be 'very careful how [we] live'
we should think about how to honor God with our words
We please the Lord with our tongue when we show discernment
'He who restrains his lips is wise,' Proverbs 10:19 reminds us 
When we do speak, we are to filter the words that escape our lips: 'Whoever guards his mouth and tongue keeps his soul from troubles'
It is important to use kind, positive words even to address tough subjects
'A harsh word stirs up anger,'
but 'the tongue of the wise uses knowledge rightly'
Finally, avoid words that reflect poorly on who we are as God's children
Paul's admonition to 'let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth'
sets a strong standard for the righteous use of words
To honor God in each part of life, use words that are pleasing and acceptable to a holy God.
In his sermon titled 'What Is the Recession For?' pastor John Piper suggests that when the economy plummets, God has His own purposes Some of them might be
1 To expose hidden sin and so bring us to repentance and cleansing
2 To wake us up to the constant and desperate condition of the developing world, where there is always and only recession of the worst kind
3 To relocate the roots of our joy in His grace rather than in our goods, in His mercy rather than in our money, in His worth rather than in our wealth
4 To advance His saving mission in the world, the spread of the gospel and the growth of His church, precisely at a time when human resources are least able to support it
5 To bring His church to care for its hurting members and to grow in the gift of love
What else does God want to teach us in difficult times
That nothing is impossible with Him
That He who owns 'the cattle on a thousand hills'
is not limited by an economic downturn
That God hasn't placed a moratorium on the Great Commission nor abandoned us
Let's not put our hopes on worldly prosperity, but on the One who owns it all!
When it comes to jigsaw puzzles, we all know that to enjoy a satisfying outcome you need all the pieces
In many ways, life is like that
We spend our days putting it together, hoping to create a complete picture out of all the scattered parts
Yet sometimes it seems like a piece is missing
Perhaps we've been pursuing the wrong pieces to the puzzle
Even though we may know that life without God at the center is a life that has lost the most important piece, 
do we live as though He isn't particularly relevant
And even though we may attend church regularly, is He the throbbing center of our lives
Sometimes we grow accustomed to feeling distant from God
This makes it easier to sin, complicating the sense that something important is missing
But no matter how far we may drift from God, He wants us near
He appealed to His people through the prophet Isaiah: 'Why do you spend money for what is not bread, and your wages for what does not satisfy
Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, and let your soul delight itself in abundance'
If something is missing in your life, remember that God is the only One who can fully and abundantly satisfy you
Let Him complete the picture of your life.
Today is National Honesty Day in the United States
It is a little-known designation for April 30, but an important one nonetheless
Author M Hirsh Goldberg established National Honesty Day in the early 1990s as a way to honor the honorable and encourage honesty
He said that April 30 was selected because 'April begins with a day dedicated to lying [April Fool's Day] and should end on a higher moral note.'
Honesty Day would be a good time to review the value of this trait according to God's Word
Honesty is not as easy as it seems but we please God by striving for it
An understanding of honesty begins with recognizing that God 'our ultimate example' is truth and that He cannot lie
Also, He hates falsehood
Beyond that, all lies have as their originator Satan himself
For our part, we can use these Scriptures as our guide: 'A righteous man hates lying'
; love rejoices in truth ; lying is part of the old nature ; growth means setting aside deceit ; and speaking truth declares righteousness
Let's make every day Honesty Day.
Is your life too busy
Business deadlines, productivity quotas, and shuttling children to lessons and sporting events can really fill up your schedule
It's easy to think, If only I didn't have so many responsibilities, then I could walk in vital union with God
Yet C S Lewis wisely points out that no one was busier than Christ
'Our model is the Jesus
of the workshop, the roads, the crowds, the clamorous demands and surly oppositions, the lack of all peace and privacy, the interruptions
For this is the Divine life operating under human conditions.'
We read of Jesus in Capernaum: 'At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to Him all who were sick and those who were demon-possessed
And the whole city was gathered together at the door
Then He healed many'
The next day Christ sought out a solitary place and prayed
There He received direction from His Father to pursue a demanding ministry in another place
Our Lord communed with His Father and depended on the Spirit to minister through Him
Is your schedule demanding
Follow the example of Jesus and set aside a specific time for prayer
Then depend upon God's power to help you meet each day's demands.
As a young girl, Amy Carmichael wished she had blue eyes instead of brown
She even prayed that God would change her eye color and was disappointed when it didn't happen
At age 20, Amy sensed that the Lord was calling her to serve Him as a missionary
After serving in various places, she went to India
It was then that she realized God's wisdom in the way He had made her
She may have had a more difficult time gaining acceptance from the brown-eyed people if her eyes had been blue
She served God in India for 55 years
We don't know for sure that Amy was more readily accepted because of her eye color
But we do know and believe that it is the Lord 'who has made us, and not we ourselves'
As we submit to His wisdom in everything, we can serve Him effectively
Amy knew what submission was
When asked about missionary life, she replied, 'Missionary life is simply a chance to die.'
Jesus said, 'Whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it'
That describes the devoted Christian's life as well total surrender to God's plans and will for us
May we submit to Him today.
The ancient Israelites gathered at Gilgal for the coronation of Saul as their first king
The Lord was not pleased that His people had asked for a king, yet on this occasion Samuel uttered these words
'The Lord will not forsake His people, for His great name's sake, because it has pleased the Lord to make you His people'
We too are God's 'own special people'
if we have trusted Jesus as Savior
He will not forsake us even though He knows we will fail Him
He knows what we are like sinful, weak, and frail
He knew it before He called us and drew us to Himself
The certainty of our salvation rests not in ourselves but on the character of God
He will keep us to the end
This does not give us an excuse to continue in sin
Paul said, 'Certainly not
How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?'
Our choices do reflect on God's reputation, our witness in the world, and our fellowship with Him
But God will never reject His people, those who are truly His
The Lord cannot and will not forsake His own
We can rest assured
What God saves, He keeps for the sake of His great name!
During the 1920s and 30s, photographer August Sander set out to portray a cross-section of German society
Through his lens he saw factory workers and financiers, actresses and housewives, Nazis and Jews
Even though his published collection contains only people in and around his hometown of Cologne, he captured what David Propson, writing in The Wall Street Journal, called 'a universe of humanity in his restricted sphere.'
That phrase strikes me as an apt description of our lives and the people we meet day by day
Wherever we live, we cross paths with people from many backgrounds and beliefs
For years, the apostle Paul traveled and preached before being imprisoned in Rome
There he continued to touch people with the gospel because he cared about them and wanted them to know Jesus Christ
The book of Acts concludes with Paul confined in Rome, living under guard in a rented house, where he 'received all who came to him, preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ'
Instead of focusing on his restrictions, Paul saw opportunities
That's the key for us as well
There is a universe of humanity within our reach today.
The bumper sticker 'Jesus is my co-pilot'
may be a well-intentioned sentiment, but it has always troubled me
Whenever I'm in the driver's seat of my life, the destination is nowhere good
Jesus is not meant to be just a spiritual 'co-pilot' giving directions every now and then
He is always meant to be in the driver's seat
We often say that Jesus died for us, which of course is true
But there's more to it than that
Because Jesus died on the cross, something inside of us died the power of sin
It's what Paul meant when he said, 'I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me'
We were essentially co-crucified with Him
With Jesus in the driver's seat, the old destinations are off-limits
No more turning down the streets of self-centeredness, greed, or lust
No more off-road ventures into the swamp of pride or the ditch of bitterness
We were crucified with Him and He is at the wheel now
He died so that He alone can drive and define us
So, if you've died and Christ lives in you, He's not your co-pilot
Your joy is to let Him drive and define your life
There may be a few bumps in the road, but you can count on it
He'll take you somewhere good.
Sports team names have a variety of origins
They come from history , nature , and even colors
One even comes from the mollusk family
In the 1980s, the University of California at Santa Cruz was just starting to get involved in competitive sports
UCSC had a bit of disdain for the overemphasis some big-time schools place on athletics
so the student body sought a team name that would reflect a somewhat different approach
They decided on the Banana Slug, a yellow, slimy, slow, shell-less mollusk
It was a clever way for UCSC to give a balanced perspective on the relative worth of sports
I have always loved sports
but I know that they can easily become more important than they should be
What matters most in life is what Jesus said is most vital loving God with all of our hearts and loving our neighbors as ourselves
Micah listed God's requirements this way: 'do justly,' 'love mercy,' and 'walk humbly with your God'
For believers in Jesus, it is vital that nothing else takes top priority over God's expectations for us
What matters most to you
The Spartans The Red Sox
Or loving God in thought, word, and action
It's been a long, cold winter
I am eager for warm weather
I'm tired of seeing bare trees and lifeless brown leaves covering the ground
I long to see wildflowers poke through the dead leaves and to watch the woods turn green once more
Yet even as I anticipate my favorite season, I hear my mother's voice saying, 'Don't wish your life away.'
If you're like me, you sometimes hear yourself saying, 'When such and such happens, then I will
or, If only so and so would do this, then I would do that
or, I would be happy if
or, I will be satisfied when
In longing for some future good, we forget that every day regardless of the weather or our circumstances is a gift from God to be used for His glory
According to author Ron Ash, 'We are where we need to be and learning what we need to learn
Stay the course because the things we experience today will lead us to where He needs us to be tomorrow.'
In every season, there is a reason to rejoice and an opportunity to do good
The challenge for each of us every day is to find something to rejoice about and some good to do and then to do both.
Living in Colorado, I climb mountains
On summer weekends, I see casual hikers who have no idea what they are doing
In sandals, shorts, and T-shirts, carrying a single container of water, they start up a trail at mid-morning
They have no map, no compass, and no rain gear
My neighbor, who volunteers for Alpine Rescue, has told me stories of tourists rescued from certain death after wandering off a trail
Regardless of the circumstances, Alpine Rescue always responds to a call for help
Not once have they lectured a hapless tourist, 'Well, since you ignored the rules of the wilderness, you'll just have to bear the consequences.'
Their mission is rescue
They pursue every needy hiker, no matter how undeserving
The central message of the Bible is one of rescue
Paul points out that none of us 'deserve' God's mercy and none of us can save ourselves
Like a stranded hiker, all we can do is call for help
Quoting the psalmist, he says, 'There is none righteous, no, not one; 
there is none who understands; there is none who seeks after God'
The good news of the gospel is that in spite of our state, God seeks after us and responds to every plea for help
You might say that God is in the rescue business.
The name of a pretty Bavarian town in Germany shares the name of a place of horror Dachau
A museum on the grounds of this infamous Nazi concentration camp attracts many World War II history buffs
As you look around, it would be hard to miss the misleading words welded to an iron gate: Arbeit Macht Frei
This phrase Work Makes You Free was just a cruel lie to give false hope to those who entered this place of death
Many people today have false hope that they can earn a place in heaven by working at being good or by doing good things
God's standard of perfection, however, requires a totally sinless life
There's no way any of us can ever be 'good enough.'
It is only through the sacrifice of the sinless Savior that we are made righteous
God made Jesus 'who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him'
Eternal life is given because of God's gift of grace not because of our good works
Don't let Satan trick you by giving you false hope that your good works will save you
It is only through Jesus' work on the cross that you can have real freedom.
A woman in Oregon was caught driving 103 miles per hour with her 10-year-old grandson in the car
When she was stopped by the police, she told them that she was only trying to teach him never to drive that fast
I suppose she wanted him to do as she said, not as she did
The Pharisees and teachers of the law seemed to have a similar problem
Jesus had a scathing assessment of them: They were spiritually bankrupt
He held these two groups directly responsible for this sad spiritual condition
As the successors of the lawgiver Moses, they were responsible for expounding the law so that people would walk in God's ways and have a genuine and vibrant relationship with the Lord
But their personal interpretation and application of the law became more important than God's law
They did not practice what they preached
What they did observe was done not to bring glory to God but to honor themselves
Jesus exposed who they were image managers, posers, and hypocrites
The test of the effectiveness of following Jesus is not just in what we say but in how we live
Are we telling others God's Word and doing what it says
Let's model by words and actions what it means to follow Him.
People have some needs that are excruciatingly deep
Poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson wrote, 'Never morning wore to evening, but some heart did break.'
We find ourselves in conversation at times with heartbroken friends and may feel at an utter loss to know what to say
How can we 'speak a word in season to him who is weary,'
as it says in Isaiah 50:4
Telling people what human teachers have taught us may have some impact on them
But the most helpful or persuasive words are spoken by those who are taught by the Lord Himself
That's why it's essential for us to sit at Jesus' feet and learn from Him
The more we receive from Him, the more we have to give to others
George MacDonald pictures this time with the Lord as having 'a chamber in God Himself.'
He continues: 'Out of [that] chamber
man has to bring revelation and strength for his brethren
This is that for which he was made.'
It's through our thoughtful and prayerful Bible study, reading, and quiet meditation that God speaks to our hearts
He gives us 'the tongue of the learned'
so that we have something to share with those who are in the depths of despair.
William Scoresby was a British seafaring explorer in the 19th century who responded to God's call to the ministry
An interest in the workings of navigational compasses stayed with him during his work as a clergyman
His research led to the discovery that all newly built iron ships had their own magnetic influence on compasses
This influence would change at sea for various reasons leading crews to read the compass incorrectly
Often this led to disaster
There is a striking parallel between the misread compass and false biblical teaching
In 1 Timothy 1, Paul warned against 'fables and endless genealogies'
man-made changes in the doctrines of God's Word
People who teach false doctrines 'have suffered shipwreck,' Paul concludes
Two people who opposed the Word of God by placing false teaching in its place, and who thus faced spiritual shipwreck, were Alexander and Hymenaeus
Biblical truth is being questioned and in some cases even replaced in the church today
Our opinions must never replace the truth of God's Word
The Bible, not man's erroneous opinions about it, is the ultimate guide for our conscience in navigating life's changing seas
Beware of wrong readings.
A young man told his father, 'Dad, I'm going to get married.'
'How do you know you're ready to get married, Ron?' asked the father
'Are you in love?'
'I sure am!' he replied
The father then asked, 'Ron, how do you know you're in love?'
'Last night as I was kissing my girlfriend goodnight, her dog bit me and I didn't feel the pain until I got home!'
Ron has got that loving feeling, but he has a lot of growing to do
Vernon Grounds, a former writer for Our Daily Bread, who has been married for more than 70 years
He shares these points about how to grow in love: Ponder God's love in Christ
Take time to reflect on how He gave His life for you
Read about Him in the Gospels, and thank Him
Pray for the love of God
Ask Him to give you an understanding of His love and to teach you how to live that out in your relationships with your spouse and others
Practice the love of God
Give of yourself
A newlywed told me he thinks love is practical
He said, 'My responsibility is to make life easier for my spouse.'
The other, tougher side of love is to challenge each other to act in godly ways
Love will grow when we ponder love, pray for love, and practice love.
It has been said that the Roman Empire ran on olive oil
It was used in cooking, bathing, medicine, ceremonies, lamps, and cosmetics
For decades, olive oil from southern Spain was shipped to Rome in large clay jugs called amphorae
Those jugs, not worth sending back, were discarded in a growing heap of broken shards known as Monte Testaccio
The fragments of an estimated 25 million amphorae created that man-made hill, which stands today on the bank of the Tiber River in Rome
In the ancient world, the value of those pots was not their beauty but their contents
Because of this, the first-century followers of Christ would have clearly understood Paul's illustration of the life of Jesus in every believer
'But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us'
Our bodies, like amphorae, are temporary, fragile, and expendable
In our modern world that highly values outward beauty, we would be wise to remember that our greatest treasure is the life of Jesus within us
By God's grace and power, may we live so that others can see Christ in us
We are just the clay pots
Jesus is the true treasure within us.
With 4 years of seminary under my belt, I walked into my first ministry with a long agenda
As a new pastor, I thought I was there to change that place
Instead, God used that place to change me
The board members were supportive, but they relentlessly kept my feet to the fire in administrative details
I needed to learn how to work with lay leadership, how to be careful in my work, and how to dream with others
We often think God has assigned us to change the world around us when in reality He is interested in changing us
To make each of us 'a vessel for honor, sanctified and useful for the Master, prepared for every good work'
God often uses the most unlikely people in the most unlikely places to teach us some of life's most difficult lessons
And just when we think we've arrived, He is instructing us further
Not long ago I entered a new season of ministry
I may be a 'seasoned veteran,'
but I'm still learning, still growing, and still amazed at how God continues to shape this vessel for His noble purposes
If you want to be an agent of change, don't resist the true Agent of Change
He has your best interest and His at heart!
As I was giving myself a manicure, I started feeling sorry for my right hand
It does the most work, but my left hand gets the most attention
My right hand applies nail polish smoothly to my left-hand nails, 
but my left hand, lacking skill and coordination, does not return the favor
The polish on my right hand is always smeared and messy
One hand does the better work, but the other hand gets all the attention and honor
As I worked on my fingernails, my thoughts turned toward something much more important the people in my church
many of whom are highly skilled at tasks that make others look good
These hardworking folks, however, seldom get noticed, because their work puts the attention on someone else
It seems unfair that those who do such good work get little appreciation
Truly servant-minded believers, though, don't see it that way
They give preference to others because they know that God sees what others do not and that He will reward those whose work is unseen by others
Is someone else reaping the benefit of your hard work
Be encouraged
God rewards those who work 'invisibly'
to make Christ visible to the world.
Giraffes have the shortest sleep cycle of any mammal
They sleep only between 10 minutes and 2 hours in a 24-hour period and average just 1.9 hours of sleep per day
Seemingly always awake, the giraffe has nothing much in common with most humans in that regard
If we had so little sleep, it would probably mean we had some form of insomnia
But for giraffes, it's not a sleep disorder that keeps them awake
It's just the way God has made them
If you think 1.9 hours a day is not much sleep, consider this fact about the Creator of our tall animal friends
Our heavenly Father never sleeps
Describing God's continual concern for us, the psalmist declares, 'He who keeps you will not slumber'
In the context of this psalm, the writer makes it clear that God's sleepless vigilance is for our good
Verse 5 says, 'The Lord is your keeper.'
God keeps us, protects us, and cares for us with no need for refreshing
Our Protector is constantly seeking our good
As one song puts it: 'He never sleeps, He never slumbers
He watches me both night and day.'
Are you facing difficulties
Turn to the One who never sleeps
Each second of each day, let Him 'preserve your going out and your coming in'
It was a simple task, but I was in over my head
One of the items on the grocery list was soy
Problem was, I didn't know what kind of soy my wife, Sue, had in mind when she made the list
After searching the aisles and asking the advice of a worker who was stacking soup cans, I grabbed a bottle of soy sauce, placed it in the cart, and went on my way
Only after I unloaded my bags at home did I discover that Sue didn't want soy sauce She wanted soy milk for our granddaughter Eliana
I was sincere in my search
I even asked for help and confidently pulled my selection off the shelf
But it didn't do me any good
I had the wrong stuff
Sadly, some people are walking through the grocery store of life with 'heaven' on their list, but they are not getting what they need
Despite their sincerity and the intended help of others, they grab something that won't get them to heaven because they find a 'different gospel'
Jesus said, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life
No one comes to the Father except through Me'
And Peter said, 'There is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved'
Trust Jesus
Don't settle for the wrong gospel.
The Taj Mahal in India is a magnificent mausoleum
Built entirely of white marble, it was commissioned by the Emperor Shah Jehan in memory of his wife, who died suddenly
It took 22 years to complete
Millions of tourists visit this memorial annually in order to see this grand structure the emperor ordered to be built in memory of the woman he loved
Millions of people also throng to Jerusalem to look at another site
a tomb that some say may have been where Jesus was buried
No matter what tomb He lay in, Jesus occupied it for only a few days
It has been empty for 2,000 years
Jesus doesn't need us to build a memorial to Him
Instead, He gave us the Lord's Supper as a memorial to remember Him
On the night He was betrayed, Jesus took bread and the cup and gave thanks to His Father before offering them to His disciples
Each time we partake of those elements in church, we are first to examine ourselves and our relationship with God
'As often as [we] eat this bread and drink this cup'
we are to do so in remembrance of the One we love, till He comes
The Lord has given us an enduring memorial to remind us of what He has done for us.
Obadiah is the shortest book in the Old Testament
Yet hidden away in its brief record is a vital question that affects us all
How should we respond when we see an enemy experience misfortune
The prophet Obadiah ministered during the time that the city of Jerusalem was under fierce attack by the armies of Babylon
The neighbors of Jerusalem, the Edomites, were actually cheering on the enemy armies to destroy and kill
Ironically, these hurtful jeers were spoken by blood relatives of the Jews
They were descendants of Jacob, and the Edomites were descendants of Esau
Obadiah condemned the Edomites for gloating: 'You should not have gazed on the day of your brother in the day of his captivity; nor should you have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction'
If someone has repeatedly been hurtful to us, it is easy to give in to vindictive pleasure when they experience misfortune
But Scripture admonishes us, 'Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, and do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles'
Instead, we are to maintain an attitude of compassion and forgiveness, and trust God to bring justice in His time.
Have you ever dreamed that you were falling out of bed or from some great height, and you awoke in fright
I remember that as a boy I would often be awakened by such a terrifying feeling
I heard about a man who had this sensation as soon as he slipped into sleep
He was so rudely awakened by his sense of falling that he was afraid to go back to sleep
He feared he would die, and he imagined he was falling into a bottomless pit
Then one evening as he was strolling through a cemetery, he saw this phrase engraved on a tombstone
Underneath Are The Everlasting Arms
These words reminded him that when believers die, they are safely carried by the Lord to their home in heaven
He recalled the assurance of the psalmist, 'Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for You are with me'
The once-fearful man realized that in life and in death and even in sleep the 'everlasting arms'
of our loving Lord are there to catch and hold us
That night he was able to sing what he was taught in childhood, 'Teach me to live that I may dread the grave as little as my bed!'
At last he could fall asleep without fear.
What a frustrating problem pollution is
Everybody suffers with it, yet everybody contributes to it
Pollution takes many forms, but one type is often overlooked
Charles Swindoll calls it 'verbal pollution,' passed around by grumblers, complainers, and criticizers
'The poison of pessimism,' Swindoll writes
'creates an atmosphere of wholesale negativism where nothing but the bad side of everything is emphasized.'
A group of Christian friends became concerned about this form of pollution and their personal part in it
So they made a pact to avoid critical words for a whole week
They were surprised to find how little they spoke
As they continued the experiment, they actually had to relearn conversation skills
In Ephesians 4, Paul called believers to 'put off' the old self and its conduct that grieves the Holy Spirit and 'put on' the new self that builds up others
As we rely on the help of the Spirit , we can make those changes in our conduct, our thinking, and our speaking
If we want to be rid of verbal pollution, we must choose to change and ask for God's help
It's a great way to start cleaning up our spiritual environment.
An anonymous author wrote, 'When I was first converted, and for some years afterward, the second coming of Christ was a thrilling idea, a blessed hope, a glorious promise, the theme of some of the most inspiring songs of the church
'Later it became an accepted tenet of faith, a cardinal doctrine, a kind of invisible trademark of my ministry
It was the favorite arena of my theological discussions, in the pulpit and in print
Now suddenly the second coming means something more to me
Paul called it '\sthe blessed hope.'
But today it appears as the only hope of the world.'
From the human standpoint, there is no solution for the struggles of the world
Leaders are naturally frustrated in trying to deal with the increasing problems in society
The only complete and permanent solution is found in the return of Christ to earth
When He comes, He will set up His kingdom
He will rule the nations in righteousness, and 'the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea'
As we await our Savior's return, let us keep on praying, working, and watching, while 'looking for the blessed hope' our only hope for this world.
In an evangelistic meeting in Ireland, the speaker was explaining what it means to abide in Christ and to trust Him completely in every trial
Concluding his message, he repeated several times, 'It means that in every circumstance you can keep on saying, '\sFor this I have Jesus.' '
The meeting was then opened for testimonies
One young woman said, 'Just a few minutes ago I was handed this telegram 
It reads, '\sMother is very ill; take train home immediately.' 
When I saw those words, I knew that tonight's message was meant just for me
My heart looked up and said, '\sFor this I have Jesus.' Instantly a peace and strength flooded my soul.'
Three or four weeks later the evangelist received a letter from this woman
'Thank you again for the message you gave that day
Life has become an uninterrupted psalm of victory, for I have come to realize that no matter what life brings, for this I have Jesus.'
That believer in Christ had found in her Savior the One who would be with her 'through fire and through water,'
and who would bring her 'out to rich fulfillment'
If you are enduring a great trial of affliction, remember for this you have Jesus!
Praise is powerful
When Scottish pastor Robert Murray McCheyne was troubled with a coldness of heart toward the things of the Lord, he would sing the praises of God until he felt revived in his spirit
Those in his household were often able to tell what hour he awoke because he began the day with a psalm of praise
One day, while he was trying to prepare his heart for preaching, he wrote in his journal: 'Is it the desire of my heart to be made altogether holy
Lord, You know all things
I've felt so much deadness and grief that I cannot grieve for this deadness
Toward evening I revived
Got a calm spirit through [singing psalms] and prayer.'
McCheyne had been uplifted by praising God
Perhaps you feel as if you are mired in what John Bunyan called the 'slough of despond.'
Lift a song of praise to the Lord
The psalmist said, 'I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever'
When we do that, the praise will flow not only from our lips but also from our heart
The Lord delights to give 'the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness'
Yes, 'it is good to sing praises to our God'?, at all times .
New York City
Easter Sunday, 7:30 a.m
I was the only customer at Jimmy's Diner in East Harlem when a man entered and approached my table
He said, 'Good morning, and God bless you,'
left a gospel tract, and quickly walked out
I smiled, appreciating his witness and realizing that God has His people everywhere
That night I attended church with our daughter Debbie, joining an enthusiastic congregation of 300 people, most in their twenties and thirties
Their infectious love for Christ and others was a bright light in a city that is often considered spiritually dark
In the first century, Paul visited the Greek city of Corinth, which was known for its immorality and corruption
When he faced opposition for presenting Jesus as Messiah, the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision
'Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not keep silent;
for I am with you, and no one will attack you to hurt you; for I have many people in this city'
No matter where we go, the Lord's people are there
The risen Christ is powerfully present in and through all who know Him
The Lord has His people where you are today
Look for them and Join them
Christ is risen indeed!
After my doctor announced that I had cancer, I tried to listen to what he said, but I couldn't
I went home, pulled a blanket over my head, and fell asleep on the couch, as if sleeping could change the diagnosis
When I finally gained enough strength to tell my loved ones, my friend Judy Schreur said something especially memorable
After expressing her sympathy, she said, 'This is what will happen
You will feel really bad for 3 days
Then you will get up, figure out what you have to do, and get on with your life.'
Then she added, 'I think it has to do with death, burial, and resurrection.'
At the time, I didn't believe it
I was sure that life as I knew it was over
Nothing would ever be the same
I couldn't imagine feeling normal again
But she was right
Three days later I woke up and realized I didn't feel quite so bad
And little by little, despite the physical misery of chemotherapy treatments, my emotional and spiritual condition improved significantly
I 'died' to my old reality and was 'raised' to a new normal
Thankfully, God is in the business of resurrection
For those who have died in Christ, the death of one reality means resurrection to a new, glorious normal so that we can 'walk in newness of life'
In 1602, Italian artist Caravaggio produced a painting called The Taking of Christ
This work, an early example of the Baroque style, is compelling
Created in dark hues, it allows the viewer to contemplate Jesus' arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane
Two main elements of the scene depicted in the painting demand the observer's attention
The first is Judas as he delivers the traitor's kiss
Immediately, however, the viewer's focus is drawn toward Jesus' hands, which are passively clasped together
It show that He offered no resistance to this injustice
Although He possessed the power to create a universe, Christ gave Himself up voluntarily to His captors and to the waiting cross
Long before this scene took place, Jesus told His listeners that no one could take His life from Him
He would lay it down willingly
This heart of voluntary surrender was prophesied by Isaiah, who wrote, 'He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so He opened not His mouth'
Christ's lamblike self-sacrifice is a grand indicator of His powerful love
'Greater love has no one than this,' He explained, 'than to lay down one's life for his friends'
Think of it
Jesus loved you that much!
Sometimes silence is the best response to a false charge
At other times we must speak up
When false witnesses accused Jesus as He stood before the Sanhedrin, He 'kept silent'
Defending Himself would have been useless
Furthermore, He was fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah 53:7
But earlier in His ministry, Jesus rebuked the Pharisees, challenging them to prove that He sinned
A pastor resigned from his church because a few members made untrue statements about him
He thought it unchristian to defend himself, and in some instances it is
But in this case, the troublemakers needed to be confronted and their false charges refuted
He should have urged them to repent or face church discipline
Saying nothing may allow wrongdoers to go unchallenged in their evil ways
But if God's Spirit leads us to remain silent, or if we want merely to try to salvage our wounded pride, then we should hold our tongue
Are you being falsely accused
If you discern that it's futile to argue, or if your pride has been hurt, ask God for grace to say nothing
But if you feel concern for the wrongdoers and want to see justice done, speak up!
What started out as a collection has grown into a ministry opportunity for Larry and Mary Gerbens
For the past 10 years they've been collecting artistic works based on the story of the prodigal son from Luke 15
Their collection includes a painting by Rembrandt and a number of items by other artists depicting this story
The Gerbens wanted to share their collection, so they put it on display at a local college
Larry said, 'The artists have ministered to us, and we hope their work will minister to others.'
As I wandered through the displays, I was touched by the deep need of the prodigal, his honest repentance, and the beautiful forgiveness of the father portrayed in the variety of art pieces paintings, etchings, engravings, glasswork, sketches, and silk screens
We have all been like the son in this story, who had other plans for his life than what his father had for him
We have all run away from our heavenly Father
But He welcomes us when we come to Him
You too will see the beauty of forgiveness in your heavenly Father's face when you cry out to Him, 'Father, I have sinned
If you're away from Him, head home now and experience His love.
In 1977, 15-year-old Kevin Baugh and a teenage friend decided to create their own country, just for fun
The Republic of Molossia began as they drew a map, created paper money, and made a flag
Today, Mr Baugh continues his micro-nation the same way it began just for fun
When Chicago Tribune reporter Colleen Mastony toured his 1.3 acre kingdom in the Nevada desert, Baugh assured her he still pays US taxes, which he calls 'foreign aid.'
'It's always tongue-in-cheek,' Baugh admits
'I'm doing this for the pleasure and enjoyment of having my own country.'
Not many of us will create our own nation, but we all have a kingdom of the heart where we decide who will rule
The apostle Peter wrote: 'Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts'
'Sanctify' means to set apart Christ as Lord or Ruler of our life
There is something within each of us that longs to be in control of our lives
It may be only a small corner where we assert our spiritual independence and answer to no one but ourselves
But true freedom comes when we allow Christ to rule our hearts.
At RBC Ministries, our human resources team has developed an effective and encouraging program that centers around gratefulness
When an employee notices something good another employee does here at the office, he or she can take a special 'Thank You' card provided by human resources and write a note of appreciation
It's a good feeling to walk into your office and find one of those cards on your desk
Isn't it great to be thanked for a job well done
Doesn't a good, hearty 'thank you' brighten your day
And doesn't it make your relationships a little more special just to know that your work is not being taken for granted
Everybody loves to be thanked
Even God Our heavenly Father finds pleasure in our expression of thanks to Him
It's His will that we tell Him 'Thank You.'
'Give thanks in all circumstances,' Paul said
'for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus'
The writer of Hebrews took it a step further by saying, 'Let us be thankful, and so worship God'
Keep looking for ways to improve your relationship with God
Don't forget what may be the most basic way to worship and honor Him: Tell Him 'Thanks.'
For His triumphal entry into Jerusalem, Jesus chose a donkey to serve as His royal transportation
His disciples were instructed to say, 'The Lord has need of it'
Isn't it astounding that the Son of God should use such lowly means to accomplish His purposes
Alexander MacLaren commented on this: 'Christ comes to us in like fashion, and brushes aside all our convenient excuses
He says, '\sI want you, and that is enough.' '
Think of it
The Creator of the universe needs us and desires to fit us into His eternal design
Though all-powerful and not dependent on any creature, He has chosen to carry out His plans through lowly human instruments
If this were not so, He would have taken us to heaven as soon as He saved us by His grace
Someone once asked Francis of Assisi how he was able to accomplish so much
He replied, 'This may be why: The Lord looked down from heaven and said, '\sWhere can I find the weakest, littlest man on earth?' Then He saw me and said, '\sI've found him
I will work through him, and he won't be proud of it
He'll see that I am only using him because of his insignificance.' '
You may be small in your own eyes, but God has need of you!
Early in our marriage, I thought I knew the ultimate shortcut to my wife's heart
I arrived home one night with a bouquet of a dozen red roses behind my back
When I presented the flowers to Martie, she thanked me graciously, sniffed the flowers, and then took them into the kitchen
Not quite the response I had expected
It was an introductory lesson in the reality that flowers are not my wife's primary language of love
While she appreciated the gesture, she was mentally calculating the cost of an expensive bouquet of flowers a budget breaker for a young couple in seminary
And as I've discovered through the years, she is far more interested in my time and attention
When I devote myself to her in an uninterrupted and attentive way, that's when she really feels loved
Did you ever wonder how God wants us to show that we love Him
We get a clue when we read, 'He who loves God must love his brother also'
It's that simple
One of the primary ways we show our love for God is by loving our brothers and sisters in Christ
When we genuinely love each other, it brings pleasure to our heavenly Father
So watch for opportunities to tell Jesus that you love Him
He's infinitely worth whatever it costs.
Just before kickoff at Super Bowl XLIII, Kurt Warner of the Arizona Cardinals received the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award a tribute given to the player who had best combined on-field excellence with off-field community service
'I am humbled the Lord has given me such an amazing life to impact others,' said Warner, a dedicated Christian
'Of all the awards given to NFL athletes, [this one] stands out because of what it represents.'
It represents a commitment to giving and sacrificing for others
Paying homage to those who serve is not a new concept
Paul spoke of it when he reminded the Philippians to honor those who gave themselves in serving Christ
He told them of their friend Epaphroditus, who had nearly died because of his efforts for Christ in ministering to others including the people at Philippi
How should they respond
Paul said, 'Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such men in esteem'
Clearly, when we think of those who sacrifice in serving the Savior, they are worthy of our respect and appreciation
Why not look for ways to show gratitude to those who have served you spiritually
Give them the honor they deserve.
Having suffered greatly first from cancer, and then from the grueling medical regimen pastor Dan Cummings was tired
After 2 weeks of treatment in Texas, he was looking forward to going back home to Michigan
In a post on his blog, he wrote: 'Today is far better
amazing what some hydration will do
Will fly home on the weekend to continue treatment at home.'
Dan did return to Michigan
but several days later, his journey on earth ended
He went home to be with his God whom he loved with every bit of his weakened body but mighty spirit
When I viewed his blog a few days later, his words 'Today is far better' jumped out at me
I smiled through my tears in the knowledge that Dan was now experiencing a life that is truly 'far better'
Someday we who claim the name of Jesus will also go to that place where there is 'no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying.'
It's a place where there is no more pain and where a loving Father promises to 'wipe away every tear from [our] eyes'
The life we have here isn't all there is
There is a far, far better place that Jesus is preparing for those who love Him .
When I used to teach at a Bible college in a large city, I sometimes graded papers at a food court while waiting for a commuter train
One day, I accidentally bumped my large cup of coffee
Its entire contents emptied into my open briefcase
In most cities, there is a quiet reserve on the part of commuters
However, the coffee splash was so dramatic that it could not be ignored
A man sitting nearby said aloud, 'Worst possible scenario!'
That comment was obviously an overstatement
But each of us dreads the thought of something in particular: financial loss, the death of a child or spouse, cancer, or another loss or hardship
The book of Job is a case study in worst possible scenarios
Yet Job wisely assessed God's role in trying circumstances of loss and poor health: 'He knows the way that I take; when He has tested me, I shall come forth as gold'
From this wise statement we can learn two valuable lessons: One is that what we dread most can be used to test our character and make us stronger
The other is that God will provide the strength and comfort to see us through
Cling to God
He has promised to work on our behalf, even in the worst possible scenario.
You can't see it, hear it, or touch it, but scent is powerful
The smell of things like crayons, petunias, and colognes evoke memories that transport me to the past and bring to mind people and places I might not otherwise recall
Some celebrities have fragrances named after them
Fans can identify with an actress or singer by dabbing on the scent bearing her name
Along those lines, Ladies Home Journal published a quiz to help readers determine the perfect fragrance for them
The idea is that every woman, to be memorable, should have a specific scent associated with her
The idea of a signature scent is not new
God introduced it as part of worship
In the tabernacle, a certain scent was to be associated with the Lord
The people were forbidden to use this fragrance for anything but worship
This idea continues under the new covenant, but with a stunning difference
Instead of using incense to make people think of Him, God uses Christians as His 'signature scent' to the world 
The fact that God identifies Himself with us in such a powerful way is a truly humbling thought, and causes me to ask, 'What do people think about God as a result of being around me?'
An article in The Washington Post told about a 15-year-old girl who sent and received 6,473 cell phone text messages in a single month
She says about her constant communication with friends, 'I would die without it.'
And she is not alone
Researchers say that US teens with cell phones average more than 2,200 text messages a month
To me, this ongoing digital conversation offers a remarkable illustration of what prayer could and should be like for every follower of Christ
Paul seemed to be constantly in an attitude of prayer for others: '[We] do not cease to pray for you'
'Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit'
'Pray without ceasing'
But how can we possibly do that
Missionary Frank Laubach described his habit of 'shooting'
prayers at people as he encountered them during the course of each day
In a sense, he was 'texting' God on their behalf, staying in constant communication with the Father
Laubach believed that prayer is the mightiest force in the world, and said: 'My part is to live in this hour in continuous inner conversation with God and in perfect responsiveness to His will.'
Pray without ceasing
Perhaps what Paul urged us to do can be done.
Recently it was discovered that some milk producers in China had been diluting cow's milk and adding the industrial chemical Melamine
This chemical was added because it artificially enhanced protein readings
Several infants died and others became seriously ill
Such adulteration is not new
Other countries have been adding Melamine to animal feed for at least 40 years for the same purpose, resulting in the death of animals
Another kind of adulteration is when people add to God's Word, 'the pure milk of the Word'
as Peter described it
The word pure means 'unadulterated'
or 'uncontaminated.'
The early church had to deal with those who considered circumcision necessary for salvation
That idea was rejected because it was not in accordance with the Word of God, which says that salvation is by grace alone
Peter encouraged his brethren in the Lord: 'Why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples
We believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved'
Examine carefully any teaching that asks you to do anything more than what is in God's Word
Otherwise it can be deadly to your spiritual well-being.
The movie The Princess Bride has a wedding scene in which the marrying minister says, 'Marriage is what brings us together today.'
Sometimes it is good to remind ourselves of the grand plan for marriage spelled out in Scripture
Marriage creates one new family out of two: Adam said, ' '\sThis is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh
.' Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife'
It provides a pure outlet for a divinely designed desire
'Because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband'
It forms a mutually helpful team
'The heart of her husband safely trusts her
She does him good and not evil all the days of her life'
Marriage God's way brings a man and a woman together to honor Him and help society
Celebrate marriage for the ways it brings us together in God's name.
I often take a moment as I wait at our grocery store checkout stand to scan the covers of the magazines displayed there
It seems that if they aren't about sex and money, they're about diet, fitness, health, and outward beauty
There's nothing there for the soul
The problem is that people read the wrong magazines those that are full of lies that fixate on beauty of face and form as though that's all there is
This can lead to comparison and terrible despair
Some years ago, a friend of mine told of a conversation he had with a lovely, self-assured teenager
'You're very self-confident,' he observed
'Can you tell me why?'
'Yes,' the young woman answered
'It's because I'm so pretty.'
'Oh, I'm sorry,' he said with extraordinary wisdom
'Why?' she asked in surprise 
'Because,' he replied, 'you may not always be pretty.'
'Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing' is the wisdom we read in Proverbs 31
Physical beauty all too quickly fades away; all one's efforts to keep it are doomed to fail
But there is an inner beauty authentic beauty that will endure forever in the one 'who fears the Lord'
If someone were to ask, 'Who are you?'
my guess is that you would tell a little about yourself and what you do 'I'm an electrician'
or 'I'm a nurse.'
But that's not really who you are it's what you do
Which leads to the question, If what you do is who you are, who will you be when you stop doing what you're doing?
Who you are is found in your relationship to Jesus
And this sense of identity will drive your behavior
Take Matthew, for example
As a tax collector during the reign of the Roman Empire, his life was driven by greed
But everything changed the day Jesus showed up and invited Matthew to follow Him
Suddenly Matthew had a whole new identity as a follower of Christ
And he wasn't the only one
We also read about four fishermen in Matthew 4:18-25, Peter, Andrew, James, and John, who left their nets to follow Him
Jesus is a compelling Person, and He is still looking for followers
He wants to make something of your life by giving you the identity of a follower of Jesus
It doesn't mean giving up your career, but it does mean that you will do your work and all of life according to His will and ways
So next time someone asks, 'Who are you?'
I hope you'll answer, 'I'm a follower of Jesus'?!
When my brother-in-law was a missionary in Mali, West Africa, he was involved in a traffic accident
A man had wandered into the road in front of Chuck's motorcycle
The cycle struck the man and sent Chuck and the bike sliding along the ground for more than 200 feet
Shortly after Chuck regained consciousness in the hospital, his doctor told him he had been 'really lucky.'
Chuck smiled and replied, 'God is good.'
Later he thought about the day's events
The man who was struck hadn't received any permanent injuries, and Chuck would also recover from his injuries
But what if one of them had been killed
He thought, God would be no less good
When we experience tragedy, we may wonder about God's goodness
Is God always good
Yes, He is
He doesn't promise that bad things will never happen to us, but He does promise to be 'our refuge and strength'
He doesn't promise that we will never walk through heart-wrenching circumstances, but He promises that we won't be alone
God is good no matter what suffering we are experiencing
Even when we don't understand, we can say with Habakkuk, 'Yet will I rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation'
Louis B Neumiller was known for his humility, integrity, and commitment to quality
As president of the Caterpillar Tractor Company from 1941-54, he led the manufacturer of earth-moving equipment through the challenges of World War II into global expansion
In the book In Their Time: The Greatest Business Leaders of the Twentieth Century, authors Mayo and Nohria describe Neumiller's leadership as 'success without fanfare.'
His mark of greatness, they note, was that he took his identity out of the business and 'let his company become a hero instead of himself.'
We see the same quality of selflessness in John the Baptist, the dynamic preacher who repeatedly affirmed his mission of paving the way for the Messiah
When John's followers became concerned that Jesus was baptizing people and crowds were following Him, John replied: 'You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, '\sI am not the Christ,' but, '\sI have been sent before Him.'
He must increase, but I must decrease'
As followers of Christ, are we lifting Him up instead of seeking honor for ourselves
Rather than being disappointed when our contribution is unnoticed, we should be glad because our highest privilege is to magnify the Lord
He's the hero
Honoring Him is the mark of greatness.
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, was the site of a battle that turned the tide of America's Civil War
One of the focal points of the conflict was a rocky knoll called Little Round Top where Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and the men of the 20th Maine Infantry stood their ground
Had the Confederate troops gotten past Chamberlain's men, some historians believe the Union army would have been surrounded, possibly leading to the loss of the war
The '20th Maine' was the last line of defense
Followers of Christ are also engaged in a vital war
As we battle 'the wiles of the devil'
we are called to wear the armor of God and to stand firm in the conflict
And like the Gettysburg soldiers, we have a 'last line of defense.'
For us, though, this defense is greater than any human force
In Romans 8:31-39, Paul says that our ultimate confidence is in the undying love of Christ
So complete is our protection that nothing can 'separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord'
When the enemy seems overwhelming and all seems lost, remember, we have an unbeatable last line of defense: 'We are more than conquerors through Him who loved us'
In Forever Young: My Friendship with John F Kennedy, Jr., Billy Noonan recalls the life experiences he shared with the son of President John Kennedy
In 1980, as one of the stories goes, John Jr and Billy were invited aboard the USS John F Kennedy aircraft carrier
On a guided tour of the ship, the two young men and their guide inadvertently entered a restricted area
When an officer stopped them, the guide pointed to John and said, 'This is his father's ship.'
Snapping to attention, the officer saluted John
He explained his understanding that when a US Navy ship is named for someone, it is considered that person's ship
Thus, as the son of the man for whom the ship was named, John Jr had unique privileges
This illustrates a vital spiritual principle
As adopted children in God's family, we who have been saved possess the position of sonship
Paul wrote that as believers we are 'predestined to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself'
By virtue of this sonship, we have the unique privileges that belong to the children of the King of kings
In life's challenging voyage, we can take courage that our 'Abba, Father' owns the ship and shares all with us
Praise God, we are joint-heirs with Christ!
Edwin van der Sar, goalkeeper for the Manchester United soccer team, had a 'safe' pair of hands
He kept the ball from entering his team's goal for 1,302 minutes, a world record in one season
That means that for almost 15 games of 90 minutes each, no one was able to score even one goal against his team while he was guarding the goalposts
But one goal by an opposing team in March 2009 ended his record
The psalmist David found comfort in the safest pair of hands God's hands
He wrote of God's protection in Psalm 138, 'You will stretch out Your hand and Your right hand will save me'
Like David, we can look to God's safe hands to keep us from spiritual danger and defeat
Another assurance from God's Word for followers of Christ is Jude 1:24-25: 'Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, to God our Savior, who alone is wise, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever Amen.'
That doesn't mean we'll never stumble
But it does mean we won't stumble so badly that God cannot pick us up
God's safe pair of hands can never fail ever!
The spotted owl has been disappearing in the US
Originally it was believed that old growth logging was its greatest threat
But research shows that one of the owl's relatives may be the problem
For the past 15 years, the barred owl has been rapidly migrating westward
Barred owls, which used to live exclusively east of the Mississippi, compete for the same food as spotted owls but are more aggressive and adaptable
In a similar way, our greatest spiritual conflict often comes not from outside the church, but from other Christians
This was happening in the church of Corinth
Paul took some time to address the divisive spirit that had grown in this congregation
This spirit threatened the unity of the church
Paul, with a pastoral nudge, encouraged the Corinthians to agree on the essentials and not be divided over the nonessentials
People were quarreling because they were aligning themselves with different Christian leaders Paul, Apollos, Peter, and even Christ
In creating these divisions, they were valuing their favorite leader above unity in Christ
Paul said the one essential that should unify the church is preaching the good news
That should be our united goal as well.
Less than the least of all God's mercies.'
This was the motto 17th-century English poet and clergyman George Herbert engraved on his signet ring
This motto was the phrase with which he signed his letters and books
Jacob had spoken these words when he pondered God's goodness despite his own sin and shame: 'I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which You have shown Your servant'
The word 'mercies' is from the Hebrew word chesed, meaning 'God's enduring love.'
I think it is significant that it rose from the heart of one who saw himself as utterly unworthy
Relying solely on God's faithful love, Jacob cries out: 'Deliver me!'
What an odd combination of thoughts: 'I am not worthy
Deliver me'
Unlike some who seem to have it all together, Jacob knew that everything he brought to God had been ruined by sin
He thought of himself as a man undeserving of God's grace
But his hope lay not in his worth but in the promise of God to look with favor on those who throw themselves on His mercy
Humility and contrition are the keys that open the heart of God
As He did with Jacob, God hears us when we humbly cry out to Him for mercy.
Jill Price has an extraordinary memory that has stunned scientists
In 2006, her overdeveloped memory was described in a scientific journal article, 'A Case of Unusual Autobiographical Remembering.'
Price has no special aptitude for memorizing lists of words, numbers, facts, or languages
But she does remember what happened to her on any given day over the last 30 years
Name any date and Price will tell you what day of the week it was, the weather, what she had for breakfast, the TV programs she watched, and the people she spoke with
Few of us have a memory like that
That's why we need reminders to complete simple tasks and keep our appointments
This is especially true when it comes to spiritual truth
The apostle Peter showed he understood the need of spiritual reminders when he wrote: 'I will not be negligent to remind you always of these things
Yes, I think it is right
to stir you up by reminding you
Moreover I will be careful to ensure that you always have a reminder of these things'
No matter what kind of memory we have, we need to be reminded of biblical principles
Daily Bible reading, small group studies, and involvement in a local church can all help us to remember God's vital truths.
One of my favorite Far Side cartoons is captioned 'Superman in his later years.'
It shows the elderly Man of Steel perched on a window ledge, ready to leap, as he looks back and says, 'Now where was I going?'
Forgetfulness happens to us all
while our occasional lapses may be amusing or annoying, a lack of memory toward God can be disastrous
With the people of Israel poised to enter the Promised Land, Moses challenged them to 'remember that the Lord your God led you all the way these forty years in the wilderness'
and to 'beware that you do not forget the Lord your God by not keeping His commandments'
Forgetting God can spring from: Testing
God allowed His people to hunger and then provided manna
When we lack the necessities of life, it's easy to feel that God has somehow forgotten us
Abundance or need may produce spiritual amnesia because both cause us to focus on ourselves, not on God who provides
If prosperity brings a feeling of self-accomplishment, then we have forgotten God
Humility, obedience, and praise help us remember God's faithful provision and care
Let's not forget to thank Him today for all He's done.
Martie and I recently traveled to some major cities in several countries
We were struck with how lost our world is and grieved over the millions who have never heard the message of the saving grace of Jesus
The thought of reaching our world for Christ felt overwhelming
Until I remembered the story of the boy walking on a beach
Encountering hundreds of starfish dying under the heat of the burning sun, he started throwing them back into the sea
A passerby asked, 'What are you doing?'
'Saving their lives,' the boy replied
'Forget it,' the man said
'You can't possibly save all these starfish.'
'Right,' replied the boy, 'but it makes a big difference to each one I do save.'
I love the boy's perspective
When the wave of sin threw us onto the shore to die, God sent His Son to walk on the beach to rescue all who would repent
And, as Jesus told His listeners in Luke 15, each time someone is rescued, heaven throws a party
'I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance'
Has heaven rejoiced over your rescue
If so, join the ranks of those who reach other lost souls with the rescuing grace of Jesus.
I was having a conversation with some children about God and superheroes when Tobias asked a question
An imaginative, curious 5-year-old, he asked anyone listening: 'Does God have a sidekick like Hercules does?'
His wiser, older brother, age 7, quickly responded: 'Yes, He has thousands of them' they're His angels.'
Angels are a popular topic of discussion, and people believe a number of myths about them
For instance, some people pray to angels, thinking they are on the same level as God Himself
And some believe that people become angels when they die
But here's what the Bible, our authority, teaches: 'God created angels
'Angels worship God , and are known by these terms: archangels , cherubim , and seraphim
'They minister to God's people by guarding and protecting them
'They are given special assignments by God
'God's angels rejoice when we repent of sin and turn to Christ for salvation
Only God deserves our worship
So let's join the angels in singing His praises!
As the high school chorale prepared to sing Horatio G Spafford's classic hymn, 'It Is Well With My Soul,'
Spafford, a teenager stepped forward to tell the song's familiar history
Spafford wrote the song while on a ship that was near the spot at sea where his four daughters perished
As I listened to that introduction and then the words sung by the teenagers, a flood of emotions washed over me
'Where his four daughters perished'
were hard words to grasp as I listened again to Spafford's words of faith
Having lost one daughter suddenly, I find the idea of losing four unfathomable
How could it be 'well' for Spafford in his grief
I hear the words 'When peace like a river attendeth my way'
and remember where peace can be found
Paul says in Philippians 4 that it can be found as our heart-prayers are voiced to God
By trustful praying, we unburden our hearts, divest our anxieties, and release the grip on our grief
And we can gain 'the peace of God'
an inexplicable, divine calmness of spirit
This peace supersedes our ability to understand our circumstances , and it is a guard on our heart, through Jesus, 
This peace protects us enough to allow us to whisper, even in the pain, 'It is well with my soul.'
Our flight had been airborne about 15 minutes when the pilot announced that the aircraft had a serious problem the crew was trying to analyze
A few minutes later, he announced that it was a vibration and that we would have to return to the airport
Then the flight attendants made a series of step-by-step announcements explaining what was going on and what would happen once we were on the ground
In an event that could have been terrifying, the fears of the passengers were relieved because we were given the right information
In the first century, a group of believers in Thessalonica were afraid that their believing loved ones who had died were gone forever and would miss out on the second coming of Christ
For that reason, Paul wrote, 'I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope'
Paul's words of comfort were intended to soften their fears by giving them the right information, which made all the difference in the world
While grieving their loss, they could still have hope of a coming reunion with those who were in Christ
In seasons of loss, we too can find comfort and hope because the Bible has given us the right information.
After studying the effect of the post-World War II economic boom in Japan, Richard Easterlin concluded that monetary growth does not always bring more satisfaction
More recently, economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers conducted surveys in more than 100 nations and concluded that life satisfaction is highest in the richest countries
So who's right
Let's check with the writer of Ecclesiastes
He should know
He was a truly rich man
He had the means to try everything in this world and he did
He gave himself to pleasure , grand projects , entertainment , and hard work
But he concluded that it was all 'vanity and grasping for the wind
There was no profit under the sun'
Lasting satisfaction doesn't come from possessing tangible things like savings accounts and material goods
Recent events have shown that these things can suddenly lose value
To find true happiness, we have to find it in Someone who is not from 'under the sun.'
And that is our Savior, Jesus
Hymnwriter Floyd Hawkins wrote: 'I've discovered the way of gladness
I've discovered the way of joy
I've discovered relief from sadness
When I found Jesus, my Lord.'
Only He can give joy that is full .
When I was a young teenager, my dad, uncles, cousins, and I went trout fishing at the head waters of the Sacramento River in California
The source of the river is melted snow, so the water was swift, clear, cold, and refreshing
My cousins and I couldn't resist stepping into the cool current while angling for rainbow trout
On the way home, we stopped for a dip in a pond that was far different
The pond water was warm, and it smelled stagnant
It contrasted greatly with that swiftly flowing, invigorating stream
The prophet Amos used the metaphor of a stream to illustrate the transforming power of righteousness
Appalled at Israel's dead religious ritual and their exploitation of the poor , he called for justice and righteousness to prevail
He saw that God's people were stuck in the stagnant pond of injustice toward others when what they needed was a life marked by 'righteousness like a mighty stream.'
Likewise, God desires for us to allow justice to 'run down like water'
from our lives
One way that can happen is to strive for just laws and to champion loving care for the poor
May we seek to be a part of God's mighty stream of His righteousness until Christ returns.
Leslie and her two daughters were about to be evicted from their home
Although Leslie believed that God could help, so far He hadn't given a clue as to how
She wondered, Where is God
As she drove to the courthouse, she prayed for God's intervention
Then she heard a song on the radio proclaiming, 'God is here
Let the brokenhearted rejoice.'
Could this be the assurance from God that she was longing to hear
Inside the courtroom, Leslie stood before the judge, heard his decision, and signed the legal documents, but still God had not given her an answer
As Leslie was walking to her car, a truck pulled up beside her
'Ma'am,' said the driver
'I heard your testimony inside the courtroom, and I believe God wants me to help you.' And he did
Gary helped Leslie get in contact with a woman from a local church who was able to work with the parties involved to reverse the process so that she and her girls could stay in their home
When people ask, 'Where is God?'
the answer is, 'Right here.'
One way God is at work is through Christians like Gary who are continuing the work Jesus started healing the brokenhearted and binding up their wounds .
When I first became a Christian and started attending church at age 19, I immediately fell in love with singing the great hymns of the faith
My heart overflowed with joy and thanksgiving as we sang of God's love for us in Christ
Soon one of my favorite hymns became 'Fairest Lord Jesus!'
I love the simplicity of the melody and the awesomeness of the One exalted in these words: Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight, and all the twinkling starry host: Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer than all the angels heaven can boast
Beautiful Savior
Lord of the nations
Son of God and Son of Man
Glory and honor, praise, adoration now and forevermore be Thine
God's Son, whom we sing about in this song, came to this earth, lived a perfect life, and gave Himself for us on the cross
He arose from the grave and is now seated at God's right hand
One day we'll join in worship with thousands upon thousands and say: 'Blessing and honor and glory and power be to Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, forever and ever!'
Maybe we'll sing 'Fairest Lord Jesus!' too
Until then, let's allow Jesus to be 'the fairest' above all in our personal lives by seeking wisdom from His Word and following in His ways.
In the book Another Country, author Mary Pipher met with people in their seventies, eighties, and nineties who were confronting many different life situations
'I wanted to understand the country of old age,' Pipher writes
'We are not organized in a way that makes aging easy.'
The root problem, she observed, is that young and old have become segregated, to the detriment of both groups
This social trend is not necessarily intentional
But many people do ignore and shirk their responsibilities for the elderly
In Jesus' day, the Pharisees found creative ways to avoid their family duties
In Mark 7:9-13, Jesus rebuked their common practice of dedicating their material possessions to God rather than using their assets to provide for their parents
Their tradition had violated the commandment to honor their father and their mother
Our children, work, and church activities can pull us in many directions
But that doesn't excuse us from honoring our aging parents by making provision for their needs, as much as we are able
When the time comes for us to enter the country of old age, let's hope we've set the right example for our own children to follow.
No one wants to be weak, so we find ways to appear strong
Some of us use the force of our emotions to manipulate people
Others use the force of personality to control people, and some use intellect to intimidate
Although these create an illusion of strength, they are signs of weakness
When we are truly strong, we have the courage to admit our limitations and to acknowledge our dependence on God
As a result, true strength often looks a lot like weakness
When the apostle Paul prayed that an affliction would be taken from him, God answered, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness'
Paul responded with these troubling words: 'When I am weak, then I am strong'
Toward the end of Jesus' earthly ministry, some of His disciples were striving for positions of prominence
Jesus used their argument as an opportunity to teach them that in His kingdom things are different: greatness comes when we willingly assume positions of weakness
This is a hard truth
I prefer the illusion of strength to the reality of weakness
But God wants us to realize that true strength comes when we stop trying to control people and start serving them instead.
Herman Wouk's thrilling World War II novel The Caine Mutiny contains an excellent illustration of what happens when someone becomes a follower of God
In the novel, a young man from an influential family has enlisted in the Navy
On the day of his induction, his mother drops him off in her fancy car and then kisses him goodbye
He shakes hands with the guard as he enters the building, and the door closes behind him
His mother, suddenly worried that he might not have enough money, rushes up to the door
But the guard politely stops her
When she demands entrance, he refuses to let her in
She can see her son standing inside the door, so she reaches for the doorknob
'He's my son!' she cries
The guard gently removes her hand from the knob and says softly, 'I know, Ma'am, but he belongs to Uncle Sam now
He's a sailor.'
When we believe in Jesus Christ and become His followers, we are under new authority
We are subject to new commands
Now we belong to Him
What was once important to us loses its significance
We evaluate things differently
Our new desire is to love and serve the Lord with all our heart
Have you joined His ranks?
My friends and I were anticipating a contemplative time looking at a collection of artwork about the prodigal son who returned home to a forgiving father
When we arrived at the information table, we noticed the brochures, books, and a sign pointing to the artwork
Also on the table was a dinner plate with bread, a napkin, and a glass
Each of us privately pondered what the significance of the plate could be
We wondered if it represented communion fellowship between the prodigal son and his father when he returned home
But as we examined it more closely, we realized simultaneously: Someone had left a dirty plate on the display table
And it wasn't bread, but leftover cookie bars
Our imaginations had been wrong
We had a good laugh
but then it made me think about how sometimes we imagine more than what's really there while reading the Bible
Rather than assuming that our speculation is correct, however, we need to be sure our interpretation fits with the whole of Scripture
Peter said that 'no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation'
As we depend on the Spirit's instruction, a careful study of the context, and the wisdom of respected Bible teachers, we'll avoid seeing things in the Word that aren't really there.
An antique dealer thought the wrinkled old baseball card she found might be worth $10
After posting it on eBay, she began to wonder if it might be more valuable than she had thought
She removed the posting and consulted a professional evaluator who confirmed that the photo on the 1869 card showed the Cincinnati Red Stockings, the first professional baseball team in the US
The card sold for more than $75,000
Mike Osegueda's article in The Fresno Bee said that even though the card was creased and discolored, the most important thing was its authenticity it was real
Paul and his companions suffered greatly while spreading the gospel
In 2 Corinthians 6, he listed their outward trials, their inward traits, and their spiritual resources
Try to imagine the circumstances in which all these things interacted, beatings, patience, prison, kindness, distresses, love
Although broken physically, depleted emotionally, and tested spiritually, the authenticity of their faith in Christ clearly shone through
'As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things'
In our walk with Christ, there's no substitute for spiritual authenticity being real.
During a trip to the Far East, I visited an unusual shrine made up of hundreds of statues
According to our guide, worshipers would pick the statue that looked the most like an ancestor and pray to it
A few years ago, I read about a student named Le Thai
An ancestor worshiper, he found great comfort in praying to his deceased grandmother
Because he was praying to someone he knew and loved, he found this to be personal and intimate
But when he came from Vietnam to the US to study, Le Thai was introduced to Christianity that sounded like a fairy tale based on American thinking
To him, it was the worship of a foreign God
Then a Christian friend invited him to visit his home on Christmas
He saw a Christian family in action and heard again the story of Jesus
Le Thai listened
He read John 3 about being 'born again' and asked questions
He began to feel the pull of the Holy Spirit
Finally, he realized that Christianity was true
He trusted Jesus as his personal Savior
When friends see Christianity as foreign worship, we need to respect their heritage
At the same time, we share the gospel graciously and giving them time to explore Christianity
And then trust the Spirit to do His work.
I served in the Armed Forces many years ago and have always been thankful that I was able to give those years to my country
I must say, however, that my most memorable time in the service was the brief interval when I was a 'short-timer.'
Short-timers are soldiers who have but a few weeks before discharge
They spend their last days 'mustering out' visiting the commissary and the quartermaster's office to clear accounts and return equipment
What I remember most about that period was my jaunty pace and the happy, carefree spirit with which I carried out my tasks, I had duties but few worries, for I knew I was going home
Now that I'm an 'old-timer,' once again I'm a short-timer
It won't be long before I'm discharged from my duty here
Again, my pace is jaunty and my spirit is light for I know that very soon I'll be going home
That's the outlook that Jesus and His apostles called 'hope'
Hope, in the biblical sense, means certainty and assurance
It is the firm, unshakable, indomitable belief that we will be raised from the dead and will be welcomed into our eternal home
That's enough to put joy in our heart and a spring in our step this day!
One of the most difficult experiences in my years as a pastor was telling a member of our church that her husband, her son, and her father-in-law had all drowned in a boating accident
I knew the news would shatter her life
In the days following their tragic loss, I was amazed as she and her family responded with unusual faith
Sure, there was deep brokenness, haunting doubt, and confusion
But when nothing else made sense, they still had Jesus
Rather than deserting Him in the midst of their desperately difficult days, they ran to Him as the only source of hope and confidence
This reminds me of the reaction of the disciples to Jesus
After some of them 'went back and walked with Him no more' because He was hard to understand , Jesus turned to His inner circle, and asked, 'Do you also want to go away?'
Peter got it right when he responded, 'Lord, to whom shall we go
You have the words of eternal life'
Whatever you face today, be encouraged by the words of Peter and by the example of a family who went through the fire with their faith intact
As long as you're running in the right direction to Jesus you'll find the grace and strength you will need.
Parking my car has been a lifelong problem for me
It really wasn't a high priority with my driving instructor, so I never learned to back up into a parking space until many years later
He also skipped the parallel parking lesson, and I still avoid that unless there's enough space for two or three cars
I've also struggled to understand a statement I heard when I was a young Christian
'God can't steer a parked car.'
I took that as a challenge to shift my life into motion
Along the way God would guide me in the right direction
It's an interesting thought, but it's not always the way God works
Occasionally, God does want us to 'stay parked' for a while
At times, when Moses was in the wilderness, God kept the Israelites in one place
He led them by a cloud
when it stayed still for many days, 'the children of Israel did not journey'
Waiting isn't always easy, but sometimes God wants us to stay right where He has put us
The psalmist reminds us, 'Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart'
You may feel that you're stuck and just spinning your wheels in your service for God
But keep your heart open to God's leading
Then you'll be ready to shift gears when you hear God say, 'Let's go this way.'?
February 19, 1942, was a fascinating day for Canada
It was 'If Day'? a World War II staging of a fake Nazi invasion of Winnipeg, Manitoba
The intent was to show what it would be like 'if' Canada fell under the harsh occupation of Nazi forces, and so that Canadians would support the war effort more fully
As one person described the event: 'If Day brought home the reality of Nazi occupation
Manitobans got a very bitter taste of nearly every aspect of Nazi brutality.'
The key word there is nearly
While 'If Day' was a valiant attempt to educate people about danger in the world, it could not begin to recreate the actual suffering that was sweeping Europe
Real trials in life are not ifs, they are whens
In fact, life's most profound lessons cannot simply be observed, they must be experienced
It is there, in actual seasons of heartache and loss, that we gain greater insights into life, faith, and our need of God
To that end, James wrote, 'My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience'
Trials come because we live in a broken world, but we decide if we will learn the lessons taught
There are no 'ifs' about it
it is an important way to grow.
A clerk who helped me purchase a small digital voice recorder 
He told me that he kept one just like it in his car when he worked in California
'When I began driving home after work I switched it on,' he said, 
and I talked about everything that happened that day on the job, good and bad
When I pulled into my driveway, I hit the erase button.
Then he smiled
After telling everything to his voice recorder, he apparently had no need to go over the day's problems with his wife or family
He told us to turn the other cheek, go the extra mile, forgive offenses, reject greed, tolerate each other's weaknesses, live to serve and love one another as He has loved us
It seems that in large part, peace is up to us
Paul verifies that in Romans 12:18, 'As much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men.'
This Christmas, let's make peace our gift to the world in which we live as we reflect the Prince of Peace.
If your physician called you and in a serious voice said, 'Please come in as soon as you can
I have something to discuss with you,'
you would know he has bad news
Your first response might be, 'No, I don't want to know.'
But you go because it is only when you know the diagnosis that you can learn the cure
God, our Great Physician, also has some bad news about man's spiritual condition
When against His expressed warning Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, God told Adam that all mankind would die spiritually and physically
That's the bad news
But He also gave the solution
He promised a Savior
The apostle John tells us, 'Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ'
But how does that help
Jesus came that first Christmas to bring God's grace, something that none of us deserve
because like Adam we have all sinned
But Jesus also came to reverse what sin brought
He came to be the truth that would bring us back to God
He came to 'save His people from their sins'
Listen to what the Great Physician has to say in the Bible about your spiritual condition
Then accept the cure He has provided the gift of salvation through Christ.
My son and his wife have a 120- pound American bulldog
This dog has a powerful body and fearsome face
Yet until we became friends, 'Buddy' wasn't sure he could trust me
As long as I was on my feet, he'd keep his distance and wouldn't look me in the eye
Then one day I learned that if I'd get down on the ground, the mood of Buddy's big-jowled face would change
Sensing I was no longer a threat, he'd playfully come running like a freight train, pounce on me with his big feet, and want me to scratch his muscular neck
Maybe what Buddy needed from me is a glimmer of what our God gave us by coming down to our level and living among us in the person of Christ
From the day that our first parents sinned and hid from the presence of the Lord, our tendency has been to be afraid of coming to a high and holy God on His terms
So, as Isaiah predicted, God showed how low He was willing to go to bring us to Himself
By adopting the form of a lowly servant, our Creator lived and died to disarm our wrongs
Even now He is coaxing us from the cover of our spiritual darkness to call us friends
How can we still be afraid to trust Him?
Every so often I catch myself wondering about the whole grand scheme of faith
I stand in an airport, for example, watching important-looking people in business suits, briefcases clutched to their sides, as they pause at an espresso bar before scurrying off to another concourse
Do any of them ever think about God, I wonder
Christians share an odd belief in parallel universes
One universe consists of glass and steel and wool clothes and leather briefcases and the smell of freshly ground coffee
The other consists of angels and spiritual forces and somewhere-out-there places called heaven and hell
We palpably inhabit the material world; it takes faith to consider oneself a citizen of the other, invisible world
Christmas turns the tables and hints at the struggle involved when the Lord of both worlds descends to live by the rules of the one
In Bethlehem, the two worlds came together, realigned
What Jesus went on to accomplish on planet Earth made it possible for God someday to resolve all disharmonies in both worlds
No wonder a choir of angels broke out in spontaneous song, disturbing not only a few shepherds but the entire universe .
Throughout history, Mary the mother of Jesus has been held in high esteem
And rightly so
She was singled out by God to deliver the long-awaited Messiah
But before we get lost in the significance of her life, let's take a look at what it meant for her to surrender to the assignment
Living in a small backwater Galilean village where everyone knew everyone else's business, she would have to live with the perceived shame of her premarital pregnancy
Explaining to her mother the visits of the angel and the Holy Spirit probably didn't calm things down
To say nothing of the devastating interruption that her pregnancy would bring to her plans to marry Joseph
And while we are thinking about Joseph, what would she tell him
Would he believe her
In light of these personal ramifications, her response to the angel who told her the news about her role as Jesus' mother is amazing: 'Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word'
Her words remind us that a life of significance is most often preceded by a heart eager to surrender to God's will regardless of the cost
What significant experience does God have in store for you
It starts with surrender to Him.
Newgrange is a 5,000-year-old burial passage tomb in Ireland
Built by the members of a farming community in Ireland's Boyne Valley, this magnificent structure covers more than an acre of land
It was a place where people went to struggle with the issue of death
It is best known for the beam of sunlight that moves through the chamber for 17 minutes each day from December 19 to 23 during the winter solstice, the shortest days of the year
Some say it serves as a powerful symbol of the victory of life over death
Ever since death entered the human experience in Genesis 3, it has been life's one great inevitability, and many people's chief fear
It need not be so, however
The apostle Paul wrote, 'For if by the one man's offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ'
From that moment in the Garden of Eden with the sin of our first parents, sin and death reigned
Yet we need not fear death or its consequences
Because of Christ, we can have confident hope, His victory of life over death has given us eternal life
Have you received Him?
Have you heard of the 'Christocentric Principle' of biblical understanding
Simply put, it means that everything we know about God, angels, Satan, human hopes, and the whole universe is best understood when viewed in relationship to Jesus Christ
He is at the center
Recently, I discovered that one of the less familiar Old Testament books, Zechariah, is one of the most Christocentric
This book is a good example because it speaks of Christ's humanity , His humility , His betrayal , His deity , His crucifixion , His return , and His future reign
One especially meaningful passage is Zechariah 12:10, which says, 'Then they will look on Me whom they pierced.'
The piercing refers to Israel's historic rejection of Jesus as Messiah resulting in His crucifixion
But this verse also predicts a future generation of Jews who will accept Him as their Messiah
At the second coming of Jesus, a remnant of Israel will recognize the crucified One and turn to Him in faith
This marvelous book should encourage us to look for more Christ-centered truths, both in other parts of the Bible and in all of life
Keep Jesus in the middle of everything
Live a Christocentric life.
During a devotional session at a conference, our leader asked us to read aloud 1 Corinthians 13:4-8, and substitute the word 'Jesus' for 'love.'
It seemed so natural to say, 'Jesus suffers long and is kind; 
Jesus does not envy
Jesus does not parade Himself, is not puffed up
Jesus does not behave rudely, does not seek His own
Jesus never fails
Then our leader said, 'Read the passage aloud and say your name instead of Jesus.'
We laughed nervously at the suggestion
'I want you to begin now,' the leader said
Quietly, haltingly I said the words that felt so untrue: 'David does not seek his own
David is not provoked, thinks no evil
David does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; 
David bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things
David never fails.'
The exercise caused me to ask, 'How am I hindering God from expressing His love through me?'
Do I think that other expressions of faith are more important
Paul declared that from God's perspective, eloquent speech, deep spiritual understanding, lavish generosity, and self-sacrifice are worthless when not accompanied by love
God longs to express His great heart of love for others through us
Will we allow Him to do it?
Leonard Ravenhill , a British evangelist, once said, 'The greatest miracle God can do today is take an unholy man out of an unholy world, make that man holy, then put him back into that unholy world and keep him holy in it.'
This seems to be what God did to Isaiah when He called him to speak to His people
Around the time of the death of Uzziah, one of Judah's more successful kings, Isaiah had a vision of God
The prophet saw Him as the true King of the universe, sitting on a lofty throne
In the vision, Isaiah saw seraphim worshiping God with a hymn that praised His holiness, majesty, and glory
Isaiah's vision of God led to a true vision of himself as unholy and broken before God
'Woe is me, for I am undone!', Isaiah said
This recognition of sin led him to a need for and the reception of God's cleansing grace
Newly cleansed, Isaiah was commissioned to spread God's message
The Lord sent Isaiah into an unholy world, not only to live a holy life but also to tell an unholy people about a holy God
The Lord wants to show Himself to us
Thus giving us a truer vision of ourselves, a deeper need for His grace, and a greater commitment to live and speak for Him
What a miracle!
During a talk-show interview, a celebrity confessed that she spent thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours each year on her hair and its styling
She recognized that it had become an addiction and admitted that her problem was 'submission to the hair.'
The word submission means 'an act of yielding to the authority or control of another.'
Because of her desire to look and feel beautiful, this celebrity was allowing her hair to be in control of her life
This woman's story could lead us to wonder about our own hearts' desires and what we're submitting to
Do we at times want something so badly that we submit to doing anything to get it
Are we submitting to admiration
Possessions, Self, Food, Money, Pleasure
In his epistle to the Romans, Paul said, 'to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that one's slaves'
When our desires 'war' within us , we are to submit ourselves to God as 'slaves of God'
Humbling ourselves before the Lord and asking Him to show us our heart will help us to recognize our own submission problems.
A story is told about a family that went on a picnic by a lake
At one point, their 5-year-old son waded into the lake, stepped into deep water, and sank out of sight
None of the adults in the family knew how to swim, so they ran up and down the shore in panic while the child bobbed up and down and screamed for help
Just then, a man happened by who sized up the situation, leaped into the lake, and rescued the boy
He climbed out on the bank with the child, who was frightened but unharmed, only to hear the mother ask with irritation, 'Where's Johnny's cap?'
So often we focus on small disappointments that cause us to grumble and complain rather than focusing on the wonderful things God has brought into our lives, not the least of which is His everlasting love and eternal salvation
When we complain about the small dissatisfactions of life, we're asking, in effect, 'Where's Johnny's cap?'
Paul wrote, 'In everything give thanks'
We may not be thankful for everything that comes our way, but we can give thanks in everything
It may be difficult to be grateful when we lose our job or our health fails, but we can be thankful for the good that God has brought to us in this life and grateful for the life to come.
The Nobel Prize is awarded annually to people in a variety of fields who have made an extraordinary impact
Leaders in economics, physics, literature, medicine, and peace are recognized for their contributions
When a person is acknowledged with a Nobel Prize, it is the ultimate affirmation of years of training, effort, education, and sacrifice in pursuit of excellence investments that are the source of their impact
We might wish to make a significant impact spiritually in our world, but we wonder, What is the source of spiritual and ministry influence
If we want to make an extraordinary impact for Jesus Christ, what must we invest in
Christ's first followers were impacted from spending time with Jesus
Israel's religious leaders recognized this
Acts 4:13 tells us, 'When [the leaders] saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men, they marveled
And they realized that they had been with Jesus.'
Training and education are valuable in the service of the Savior, but nothing can replace time spent in His presence
He is the source of whatever spiritual impact we might have on our world
How much time have you been spending with Jesus, your source of impact?
After our plane landed on the gravel airstrip, Jay and I climbed out and entered the world of Masai Mara in Kenya
A Masai tribesman named Sammy met us and loaded our baggage into a Land Rover
Then we headed toward the camp where we would spend the next 2 days
Stopping so we could watch the zebras and wildebeests migrating from Masai Mara to Serengeti, Sammy explained that the two massive herds travel together because the zebras have good eyesight but a poor sense of smell, and the wildebeests have bad eyesight but a good sense of smell
By traveling together, both are less vulnerable to predators
This was our first lesson from God's revelation in creation, which Kenya has in abundance
Just as God makes animals with different strengths and weaknesses, He makes people the same way
God made us to be dependent not only on Him but also on one another
The apostle Paul elaborated on this idea in his letter to the church in Corinth
As members of the body of Christ, we all have different gifts and abilities
The church is healthy only when we work together, look out for each other, and use our strengths to benefit one another.
When I was a freshman in Bible college, I began to be bolder about speaking up for the Lord
Not surprisingly, my new habit created friction with some
Attending a social event with my former high school friends bore this out
One young woman to whom I had witnessed earlier laughed at my concern about where she would spend eternity
Ed, a friend who knew of my faith, said jokingly, 'Three cheers for the old rugged cross!'
I felt put down and rejected
But later that evening I was filled with an unexplainable love
Recalling our Lord's command to 'Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you'
I prayed for Ed who had mocked the cross of Christ
With my eyes filled with tears, I asked the Lord to save him
About a year later, I got a letter from Ed saying he wanted to get together
When we finally met, he shared how he had wept over his own sinfulness and had invited Jesus Christ to be his Savior and Lord
Later, to my surprise I heard that Ed had become a missionary to Brazil
The lesson I learned from that experience is that prayer is the best response to spiritual opposition
What critic of your faith might need your prayers today?
Any fool can start a quarrel
'The name of the wicked will rot'
'He who hates correction is stupid'
Is it right for God's Word to call people fools, wicked, and stupid
Isn't God all about love and kindness
Indeed, God is love
God is kindness
He created a world with great possibilities for joy and contentment
Yet God reminds us that in His love He does not overlook the foolishness of our hearts and actions
Those verses from Proverbs can remind us that while God is love, He has great expectations for us
Life is tougher than it needs to be for those who bring self-imposed trouble upon themselves
Each negative word in those proverbs has a counterpart an alternative that gives God's preferred way to live
A fool quarrels, but the honorable man avoids strife
The name of the wicked rots, but the memory of the righteous is blessed
The stupid reject correction, but those who love instruction also love knowledge
There's always a choice in this life
Live God's way and enjoy His smile of approval or live as a fool and find destruction
That's the tough and tender truth about living in God's world
Which do you choose?
Wrinkled noses and puckered lips sometimes this is my family's reaction to my cooking, especially when I'm trying something new in the kitchen
Recently, I had a breakthrough with a unique version of macaroni and cheese
I jotted down the ingredients and tucked the recipe away for future reference
Without that set of instructions, I knew the next batch would be a flop
Without God's instructions, Joshua would have failed at leading the Israelites into the Promised Land
The first step was to 'be strong and of good courage'
Next, he was to continually meditate on the Book of the Law, and finally, he was to do everything it said
As long as Joshua followed the directions, God promised him 'good success'
God's 'recipe for success' can work for us too, but His idea of success has little to do with money, popularity, or even good health
In the original Hebrew, 'then you will have good success' means 'then you will act wisely.'
Just as God called Joshua to walk in wisdom, He wants us to 'walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise'
As we take courage in the Lord, feast on His Word, and obey Him, we have a recipe for godly success that's better than anything we could cook up on our own.
Dwight L Moody said, 'When a man thinks he has got a good deal of strength, and is self-confident, you may look for his downfall
It may be years before it comes to light, but it is already commenced.'
This was true of King Uzziah
Everything seemed to be going so well in his life
He was obedient, submitted to spiritual mentorship, and sought God's guidance during most of his reign
As long as he asked God for help, God gave him great success evidenced by his many accomplishments
Uzziah's life was one of great power and human success until he became blinded by it
His pride was evidenced in several ways: he challenged God's holiness by trespassing the temple and presuming upon a position he would never be able to have ; he viewed God's power as good but not absolutely necessary for his leadership ; he refused godly correction and counsel ; he bypassed his opportunity to repent; and he ignored, instead of feared, the consequences of his sin
When God gives us success in any area of our lives, let's not forget the Source of our success
May we choose humility, for God gives grace to the humble.
A medical school program in New York gives students who are training for geriatric medicine a unique opportunity
They experience life as nursing home residents for 10 days
They learn some of the struggles of maneuvering a wheelchair and being raised out of bed with a lift, as well as reaching the shower bar from a seated position
One student learned how little things counted for a lot like lowering nameplates on doors so that patients can find their rooms more easily, or putting the TV remote in a reachable location
Although the students still can't fully relate, they will be better able to serve the elderly in their future work
Sometimes God gives us the opportunity to use the lessons we've learned and the comfort He's given us during difficult times to help others in special ways
Paul indicated this when he wrote: 'Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble'
Are you using the lessons you've learned in your trials to touch the lives of others
Remember even little things can mean a lot.
The United States Secret Service was founded in 1865
Their mission to deal with counterfeiters in an attempt to protect the dollar and, as a result, America's national economy
This targeted group of law enforcement officers, however, experienced a change of direction in 1902
They became best known for protecting the President of the United States, although their charge still embodies a variety of tasks
That change of direction in the Secret Service duties is nothing compared to the completely altered lives of the believers at Thessalonica
They had a spiritual transformation that turned their lives around, which was noticed by people far and wide
Paul wrote, 'You turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God'
And 'you became examples to all in Macedonia and Achaia who believe Your faith toward God has gone out'
The change of direction they displayed was dramatic
abandoning the worship of idols to embrace relationship with the true and living God
And people noticed the difference in their lives
I wonder do people recognize such a profound change in our hearts and lives
When our children were young, we observed Advent by making a wreath and lighting candles each night after supper
We sang a carol and read a short Bible passage about the birth of Christ
This was a special time of preparing our hearts to celebrate Christmas
But Advent is more than that
When Christians first started practicing it in the fourth century, they viewed it not only as preparation for celebrating Jesus' birth but also as a time of looking forward to His second coming
They found hope and cheer in the sure promise of His return
The gospel of Luke describes 'the glory of the Lord' that shone around the shepherds when the angel announced the Savior's birth
Luke also records Jesus' promise that He will return 'with power and great glory'
These two events frame the purpose for which the Son of God came into the world
In Latin advent means 'a coming.'
The weeks before Christmas can be a wonderful season of repentance and expectation as we celebrate our Lord's first advent in Bethlehem and anticipate His second advent when He returns in glory
Christ has come
Christ is coming again!
My grandfathers were both gardeners and so are many of my friends
I love visiting beautiful gardens they inspire me to make me want to create something equally beautiful in my own yard
But I have trouble moving from the inspiration to the perspiration part of gardening
My great ideas don't become reality because I don't spend the time and energy to make them happen
This can be true in our spiritual lives as well
We can listen to the testimonies of other people and marvel at the work God is doing in their lives
We can hear uplifting music and great preaching and feel inspired to follow God more diligently
But soon after we walk out of church, we have trouble finding the time or making the effort to follow through
James described such Christians as being like those who look in a mirror, see themselves, but do nothing to fix what is wrong
They hear the Word, but it doesn't lead to action
James says we need to do not just hear
When we move from the inspiration of simply 'hearing' about the good being done by others to the perspiration of actually 'doing' good works ourselves, the implanted Word of God will bloom into a beautiful garden of spiritual fruit.
Displayed on the wall of my friends' lake house is a collection of pictures
Each one of the photos is of a sunset, taken from their deck during various seasons
While each is strikingly beautiful no two are identical
When I look at them, it reminds me of what another friend once called 
He called a sunset God's beautiful signature at the end of a day
God writes His signature on each sunset and on each of His unique children as well
I never grow tired of discovering how every person I meet is so delightfully different
God is infinitely creative
The variety in our personalities, senses of humor, abilities, and preferences in music and sports are all handcrafted by Him
In the body of Christ, we see how a diversity of spiritual gifts still have a common bond and can work together for God's purposes to bring Him glory
In 1 Corinthians 12:4-6, we read, 'There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit
There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord
And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all.'
God's signature that is so evident in nature is also present in His people
Let's celebrate the differences that make each of His children unique.
What do you find most refreshing
A cold drink on a hot day
An afternoon nap
Listening to praise and worship music
The biblical theme of refreshing has a variety of physical and spiritual meanings
In Scripture we read of refreshment by resting on the Sabbath , with cool water after physical activity , by soothing music , and with encouraging fellowship
The apostle Peter describes a time of spiritual refreshment that took place on the Day of Pentecost
He exhorted his listeners to repent and respond to the gospel 'that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord'
The apostle's statement was especially meaningful to the Jewish audience with its reference to the millennium when Messiah would rule
But the good news of spiritual life would also be extended to the Gentiles
Even now as believers we can experience a time of refreshing by quieting our hearts in a devotional time of prayer and Bible reading
When we spend time alone with the Lord, we can experience His peace and joy which renew us in spirit
Aren't you thankful for these daily times of spiritual refreshment?
Have you ever heard skeptics say that the Christian faith is nothing more than a crutch that the only reason people claim to trust Jesus is that they are weaklings who have to make up 'religion' to get by
Apparently those skeptics haven't heard about the doctor in one Far Eastern country who spent 2 years in jail being 'reeducated' because he professed faith in Christ
Then, after his release, he was arrested again this time for his efforts at his church
And perhaps those skeptics haven't heard about Paul
After trusting Christ, he was arrested, flogged, mocked, and shipwrecked
These believers were not looking for a crutch
No, they had something deep and essential in their hearts
They had a personal relationship with God a relationship born of faith in the work of Jesus on the cross
As a result, they became children of the King eager to sacrifice everything for the privilege of proclaiming Him
They were not limping along looking for something to hold them up
A crutch
Hardly
Faith in Christ is not about safety and caution
It's about believing Jesus and trusting Him no matter what
It's about taking up a daily cross and living for the Savior.
Not many years ago, we watched as the 'WWJD' craze swept through the Christian community
The bracelet-emblazoned theme 'What Would Jesus Do?'
was a valuable reminder to many people that we should consider the heart and mind of Jesus when making choices
As we seek to live in a way that honors the Savior, it is appropriate to measure our attitudes and decisions against the example our Lord set for us
Recently, however, I was in a church where I saw a slightly different message
This church's sign read, 'WDJD' What Did Jesus Do?'
That is indeed the more important question, because our salvation depends on it
Paramount among the remarkable deeds of the Son of God are the events described in 1 Corinthians 15:3-4, 'For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.'
What did Jesus do
He took the suffering and guilt for our wrongdoing and paid our penalty
He died and conquered death so we could live
And the fact is, we will never be able to fully consider what Jesus would do until we have embraced what He did do for us on the cross.
If you have a tendency to despair over lost opportunities or if you worry about the future, ask yourself this question: 'What is right in front of me?'
In other words, what circumstances and relationships are currently available to you
This question can get your focus off a past regret or a scary future and back to what God can do in your life
It's similar to the question God asked Moses at the burning bush
Moses was troubled
Aware of his own weaknesses, he expressed fear about the Lord's call for him to lead Israel out of bondage
So God simply asked Moses, 'What is that in your hand?'
The Lord shifted Moses' attention away from his anxiety about the future and suggested he notice what was right in front of him a shepherd's rod
God showed Moses that He could use this ordinary staff to perform miracles as a sign for unbelieving people
As Moses' trust in God grew, so did the magnitude of miracles God worked through His servant
Do you think about past failures too much
Do you have fearful thoughts about the future
Recall God's question: 'What is that in your hand?'
What current circumstances and relationships can God use for your benefit and His glory
Entrust them and your life to Him.
People love to collect things from baseball cards to stamps to coins
And while collecting can be a fun hobby, it is sobering to think that once we leave this earth, everything we own becomes part of someone else's collection
What value would it be to have collected much on earth but little or nothing for eternity
Jesus had something to say about this
Speaking to His disciples, He said: 'Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal'
Eternal treasures never lose their worth
They can never be spoiled or stolen
And just think we can actually stockpile them
Through acts of service
Through leading others to Jesus
By being compassionate to those in need
By living according to the will and ways of Jesus
In the gospel of Mark, we read that the Lord tested the rich young ruler's heart when He asked him to sell all that he had, give it to the poor, and follow Him
The ruler's response revealed what he really valued
It's easy to become enamored with earthside stuff
but when you make the choice to follow Jesus, He'll show you the joy of collecting eternal treasures
Nothing on earth can compare!
On September 30, 2009, columnist Mitch Albom sat on stage at the Fox Theater in Detroit, Michigan, to interview Ernie Harwell, one of the most beloved men in American sports
Harwell spent more than 50 years as a radio play-by-play announcer, mostly for the Detroit Tigers baseball team
His kindness, humility, and warmth as a broadcaster left an indelible impression on all who met him
When Albom interviewed him, Ernie was 91 years old and had just announced that he had incurable cancer
But as Ernie talked, he wasn't about to let people feel sorry for him
Instead, he wanted to talk about the night in 1961 when he trusted Jesus Christ as Savior
And, during one of the final times this Hall of Fame announcer would be able to speak publicly, he concluded, 'I don't know how many days I've got left
[but] I can really know
whose arms I'm going to end up in, and what a great, great thing heaven is going to be.'
Ernie was anticipating something special
He knew that God had a glorious eternal home prepared for him , so he could look death in the face and praise God
Is that your confidence
Do you know that His arms are waiting to welcome you home
At the end, that's really all that matters.
We tend to compartmentalize our lives
We fill our days with activities such as work, errands, chores, caring for children
And then we try to carve out time for 'spiritual' activities such as church, small groups, personal devotions
I don't see that separation in the Psalms
Somehow David and the other poets managed to make God the gravitational center of their lives so that everything was related to God
To them, worship was the central activity in life, not something to get through so other activities could be resumed
The process of letting God in on every detail of life is one we need
For me, the Psalms have become a step in the process of recognizing God's true place at the center
The psalmists have an urgency, a desire, and a hunger for God that makes my own look anemic by contrast
They panted for God with their tongues hanging out, as an exhausted deer pants for water
They lay awake at night dreaming of 'the beauty of the Lord'
They would rather spend one day in God's presence than a thousand years elsewhere
It was 'the advanced school of faith' that these poets were enrolled in
Maybe as we read the Psalms, some of it will rub off on us.
Anna Anderson's husband died early in their marriage
He leaves her with three young daughters and a difficult future
Although trained in Virginia as a teacher, she lacked full credentials to work in the Philadelphia schools
So she took in laundry, did ironing, and later scrubbed floors at a large department store
As African-Americans, they often experienced racial prejudice and discrimination
When doors of opportunity closed, Anna believed that if they would trust the Lord with all their heart and acknowledge Him in all their ways, He would direct their paths
She taught her daughters to depend on God, follow Him, and always be thankful
When her firstborn, Marian, rose to become an internationally acclaimed classical singer, Anna continued to pray for her, and always gave God credit for her success
Reporters, who asked Anna how she felt after attending Marian's concerts at Carnegie Hall and her 1955 debut with the Metropolitan Opera, heard her say, 'We thank the Lord.'
Her reply was not a cliche, but sincere gratefulness to God
Rather than lament what she lacked, Anna Anderson expressed gratitude for what she had and used it for God's glory
Today, we can follow her example with faith, confidence, and a heartfelt, 'We thank the Lord.'?
As I looked at family members gathered around the Thanksgiving table, I smiled at the range of talents represented
At one end were doctors; at the other end were musicians
Thanks to doctors, human bodies operate more efficiently
Thanks to musicians, beautiful sounds uplift our spirits and soothe troubled minds
Although their abilities are very different, doctors and musicians rely on the same thing: an orderly universe
Without order, there would be no predictability; without predictability, there would be no music or medicine
Within our orderly world, disease is a sign that something is 'out of order.'
Healing is a sign that God will some day restore all things to their original condition
When John the Baptist wanted to know whether Jesus was the 'Coming One,'
Jesus said, 'Go and tell John
the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel preached to them'
Healing was evidence that Jesus was Israel's Messiah
I am thankful for music that soothes my troubled mind and soul, and for medicine that heals my body
This two things remind me of the ultimate healing and restoration that Christ is accomplishing.
Last November, news sources said that a shocking breach of security occurred when a couple brazenly walked into a White House state dinner even getting close enough to have their picture taken with the President of the United States
Usually, extensive background checks and careful scrutiny of the guest list screens out the uninvited
It's a rare day for any of us that our access is not restricted in some way
Signs warn us: Employees Only, Do Not Enter, Authorized Vehicles Only, No Trespassing
None of us want to be told that we are not welcome
But the fact is that there will always be some places from which we will be barred
It makes me grateful that God sets no restriction on who may come to Him
Those who come to God encounter no 'Keep Out' signs
Through prayer, God the Father allows us immediate and unlimited access to Him
It is because His Son Jesus Christ has opened the way to all who receive Him
'Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden'
'The one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out'
'If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink'
Once you come to Christ for salvation, you can enjoy unrestricted fellowship
The door is always open.
I was feeling down about some circumstances the other day and wondering how I might lift my spirits
I pulled from my shelf the book Life Is Like Licking Honey Off a Thorn by Susan Lenzkes
I read this: 'We take the laughter and the tears however they come, and let our God of reality make sense of it all.'
Lenzkes says some people are optimists who 'camp in pleasures and good memories,' denying the brokenness
Others are pessimists who 'focus on life's losses, losing joy and victory in the process.'
But people of faith are realists who 'receive it all, all the good and bad of life and repeatedly choose to know that God really loves us and is constantly at work for our good and His glory.'
As I read, I looked outside and noticed dark clouds and a steady rain
A little later, a friendly wind came up and blew the clouds away
Suddenly the skies were bright blue
The storms of life blow in and out like that
By faith we cling to God's promise of Romans 8:28
And we recall that 'our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory'
God loves us, and He's getting us ready for the day when skies will be forever blue.
Psalm 8 begins with a startling contrast
David seems to suggest that while God has revealed His glory in the skies, another persuasive answer to His critics comes in the utterances of a child: 'Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have ordained strength, because of Your enemies, that You may silence the enemy and the avenger'
Why is a child's praise so persuasive
For one thing, it's because, unlike the impersonal universe, a child can know and love God
Jesus quoted Psalm 8:2 when religious leaders were scandalized that children were running around in the temple shouting, 'Hosanna to the Son of David!'
These little ones knew as those leaders did not know, that Jesus was the long-awaited Son of God
Some of my most memorable moments as a parent came when I knelt beside our children's beds at night, and they opened their hearts to God
The simplicity of their love and trust as they prayed touched me deeply, dispelled my doubts and fears, and drew me to faith
We must never take lightly little ones who believe in Christ
Their witness is great, as is the witness in the skies.
After a 4-year-old got into trouble at preschool, his mom asked him what he had done wrong
He explained, 'I was angry with a playmate
But you told me that I should not hit anyone, so I asked my friend to do it for me!'
Where does someone so young learn that
The Bible tells us he did not have to be taught he was born with it
It is part of the fallen nature that all of us have at birth
But the Christian does not have to respond according to his fallen nature
Paul reminds us that 'our old man was crucified with [Christ],
that we should no longer be slaves of sin'
We are 'a new creation' and have been set free and have become 'slaves of God'
Yet, as Christians we do still struggle with our flesh and its sinful desires
But now that 'we are alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord,' we can respond in a God-honoring way
Instead of being like the young boy who tried to get revenge, we can obey the instructions of Romans 6:13, 'Do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as instruments of righteousness.'
My wife, Martie, and I have grown to love England, its history, culture, and people
One of our favorite activities when we visit is going to outdoor concerts on the sloping lawns of ancient estates
'The Last Night of the Proms' event is the best, with fireworks and hundreds of nationals waving little British flags to rousing patriotic tunes
We loved joining the celebration until the summer our children came with us
When we started waving our flags with all the enthusiastic Brits, our kids were aghast
I can still hear them shouting over the music, 'What are you doing?
You're Americans!'
God must often feel like that when we blend in and live like the 'locals' around us
I can almost hear Him saying, 'What are you doing living like that?
You belong to My nation!'
Peter reminds us that we are different from the locals we are a 'holy nation'
Being holy means that we are unique, set apart for Jesus, becoming like Him, and reflecting His countercultural ways of living
It means that we are forgiving in the face of cruel offenses; and merciful, gracious, truthful, and loyal to our promises
It means being just like Him
So let's start waving the flag of holiness as members of the 'Jesus nation'
In many countries, childhood obesity is at an all-time high
A major culprit in such unhealthy weight gain is poor eating habits and junk food
The term junk food refers to items that taste good but lack nutritional value and are often very high in calories and fat
Chips, soft drinks, candy bars, cookies, and many meals purchased at fast-food restaurants fit these criteria
To be spiritually healthy, we have to avoid 'spiritual junk food' as well
Some religious teachers proclaim 'a different gospel' , ranging from health-and-wealth to a counterfeit spirituality
And some Christian music and books also contain false teaching
Taking in this kind of 'food' may seem to satisfy spiritual hunger, but it will not lead to spiritual health
Hebrews warns us: 'Do not be carried about with various and strange doctrines
For it is good that the heart be established by grace'
False teaching is detrimental to our health and is not profitable, because it cannot cleanse from sin nor give power for spiritual growth
But biblical content that is based upon grace and truth does both
Avoid 'spiritual junk food' and instead feast on God's Word to promote your spiritual health.
When we wash our hands to clean off the grime and germs, do we actually clean them ourselves
No and yes
To be precise, the soap and water does the job not us
But we make the choice to use the soap and water to clean our hands
In 2 Timothy 2, the apostle Paul tells us, 'Therefore if anyone cleanses himself he will be a vessel for honor'
This does not mean that we on our own have the power to cleanse ourselves from sin
Rather, we use the cleansing provided by Jesus Christ, who died for us on the cross
Philippians 3:9 tells us that we are 'found in Him, not having [our] own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith.'
When we receive Christ, His death and resurrection sets us free from the penalty and the power of sin
This enable us to say no and yes in everyday life
We can say no to the desires of the flesh, or 'youthful lusts' that Paul mentioned
And we can say yes to 'righteousness' , 'faith' , 'love' , and 'peace'
As we're cleansed daily, we'll be 'useful for the Master, prepared for every good work'
Internationally acclaimed violinist Midori believes that focused, diligent practice is the key to performance
While playing a rigorous schedule of 90 concerts a year, she still practices an average of 5 or 6 hours a day
Jane Ammeson, in NWA WorldTraveler magazine, quoted Midori as saying: 'I have to practice for my job and I practice every day
It's not really the hours, but the quality of the work that needs to be done
I see with students, that they play and they call it practice, but they are not listening and not watching
If you have your textbook open, it doesn't mean that you are studying.'
That same principle applies to our walk of faith
Paul wrote to Timothy, 'Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of truth'
Diligence implies constant, earnest effort, and is the opposite of a careless, inattentive approach
It embraces every aspect of our relationship with God
Just as a musician strives for excellence, we should want to serve God with confidence, seek His approval, and skillfully share His Word with others
Am I diligently studying, praying, and listening to the Lord today?
Two young men with mischief on their minds approached a missionary's outreach bus parked in a downtown area of a German city
The missionaries were there to offer refreshments as a way to open up conversations about Christ
The two visitors, wearing skull-and-crossbones bandannas, were there to offer trouble
But the missionaries didn't respond to the ruffians as they expected
The Christians welcomed them warmly and engaged them in discussion
Surprised, the guys hung around long enough to hear the gospel
One trusted Jesus that day
The other, the next day
Those two young men and the missionaries who reached them were light-years apart culturally
The guys were German; the missionaries, American
The guys were involved in a culture of darkness and death; the missionaries were shining the light
The cultural divide was crossed with cookies and nonjudgmental love
Look at the people around you
How can you show those on the other side of the cultural fence unconditional, unquestioning love
How can you cross the divide and help them see that Jesus' love knows no boundaries
Cross the divide
Take Christ to the culture even if it doesn't look anything like yours.
As my wife and I were walking through a shopping mall, we came to a T-shirt stand
While browsing the shirts and their often humorous sayings, I noticed one with a disturbing message
It read, 'So Many Christians, So Few Lions.'
That shirt, with its reference to the first-century practice of throwing Christians to the lions in the Coliseum in Rome, wasn't at all funny
Persecution is no laughing matter
Not long before those brave Christians faced death in Rome's cruel sport, Paul wrote, 'All who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution'
Persecution is inevitable, and it should be a matter of serious concern for all believers
In fact, at this very moment fellow brothers and sisters in Christ around the world are suffering in Jesus' name
What can we do about it
First, we can pray that God will comfort them in their suffering
Second, we can aid families left without support when loved ones are imprisoned
Third, we can pray now for courage should we face persecution
When the apostle Paul was put in jail for his faith, his courage led others to be bolder in their witness
Want to encourage the persecuted church
Pray, and then proclaim the message for which believers suffer.
An old TV sitcom featured an estab- lishment that the patrons seemed to frequent on a daily basis
The concept was that it was a welcoming place where 'everybody knows your name.'
We all want to be accepted, to fit in somewhere
But some people live on the margins of life where it can be difficult to feel they have any value or significance, or that they matter to anyone
Children sometimes experience this: Too tall when other kids haven't had a growth spurt yet
Too fat when the other kids are thinner
Too smart when their classmates are struggling
Or 'not smart enough' in comparison with others
Being different as a child can result in being mocked or bullied
But an adult who doesn't fit into the mold may just be ignored so insignificant that he or she feels invisible
But what a great significance we have in God's eyes
We were so valued that He sent His Son to pay the price for our sins and to allow us to have a relationship with Him
We were created in the image of God , and He has designed us and been involved in every detail of our life since before we were born
Whether or not we always feel significant, we are deeply loved by our Father.
Seventeenth-century Quaker leader Isaac Pennington said, 'The Lord has been teaching me to live upon Himself' not from anything received from Him, but upon the life itself.'
The people in John 6 wanted to live off Jesus, but not for the same reason
It was not because their hearts were loyal to Him, but because their hearts were loyal to what they thought He could provide for them namely, food and deliverance from Roman oppression
Jesus' provision of the loaves and fish was a confirmation in their minds of what He could do for them
Jesus knew that behind their interest in Him was their hope that He would become a different kind of king
so He withdrew from them
The next day they looked for Him and found Him, making their quest successful
So they continued to follow Him because of what they thought He could provide
But Jesus turned the tables and identified Himself as the Bread of Life
They wanted a better life from Him, but He told them He came to offer them eternal life
Only those who believe in Jesus can find true fulfillment now and forever
Follow Jesus, not just because He can provide 'the loaves,' but because He can satisfy your deepest hunger, the quest for eternal fellowship with Him.
On December 4, 2006, a 19-year- old soldier serving in Iraq saw a grenade being thrown from a rooftop
Manning the machine gun in the turret of his Humvee, he tried to deflect the explosive
but it fell inside his vehicle
He had time to jump to safety
Instead, he threw his body over the grenade in a stunningly selfless act that saved the lives of four fellow soldiers
This almost unexplainable act of self-sacrifice may help us understand why the Bible tells us that there is a kind of love that is more honorable than having great knowledge or faith
This kind of love can be hard to find leading the apostle Paul to lament that more people care for themselves than for the interests of Christ
That's why he was so grateful for Epaphroditus, a co-worker who 'came close to death, not regarding his life' in order to serve others
If we think we could never put our own life on the line for others, Epaphroditus shows us the first step with his selfless example
Such love is neither normal nor common, and it doesn't come from us
It comes from the Spirit of God, who can give us the desire and ability to feel for others some of the inexpressible affection God has for us.
Several years ago, I was driving down the freeway when my car died
I pulled over to the side of the road, got out of the car, and opened the hood
As I looked at the engine I thought, A lot of good this does me
I know nothing about cars
I don't even know where to start
That's how we might sometimes feel about prayer: Where do I start
That's what the disciples wanted to know when they asked Jesus, 'Teach us to pray'
The best place to look for instruction is in the example and teaching of Jesus
Two questions you may have are: Where should we pray
Jesus prayed in the temple, in the wilderness , in quiet places , in the Garden of Gethsemane , and on the cross
He prayed alone and with others
Look at His life, follow His example, and pray wherever you are
What should we pray
In the Lord's Prayer, Jesus taught us to ask that God's name be honored and that His will be done on earth as it is in heaven
Ask Him for your daily provisions, for forgiveness of sin, and for deliverance from temptation and evil
So if you're looking for a good place to start, follow the example of the Lord's Prayer.
In her book Food in Medieval Times,  author Melitta Adamson writes of European culinary delights in the Middle Ages
Wild game, pastries, puddings, and other exotic foods illustrate the creative joy taken in food preparation
But with all these wonderful entrees there was a problem overeating
This tendency was compounded by the Christian calendar, which abounded with fasts and feasts
Abstaining from meals was often followed by gluttony
To address this problem, theologian Thomas Aquinas uplifted the Christian character quality of temperance, calling it 'a special virtue.'
He saw how self-restraint should extend to all areas of life
For the believer, temperance, or moderation, does not derive from sheer human willpower
Instead, it comes from the Holy Spirit who gives us self-control: 'The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control'
Self-control is the Spirit-produced quality that enables us to be 'temperate in all things'
Overindulgence in food, rest, work, recreation, ministry, and a variety of 'good things' can be corrected only through the balance of self-control
Take a few minutes to ask God to produce that special virtue in you.
When my daughter and her family were in town for a visit, I had a chance to take my son and two sons-in-law out for a 'guy' outing
We decided that while the ladies were shopping, we would go to a firing range and practice shooting
We rented two pistols and took aim at our targets
While shooting, all four of us discovered that on one of the firearms the sight was set too low
If we aimed using that sight, we hit the bottom of the target
We had to aim high in order to hit anywhere near the bull's-eye
Isn't life a lot like that
If we set our sights too low, we really don't accomplish all that we can
Sometimes we have to aim high in order to reach a desired goal
What should be our aim in life
How high should we point our ambitions
Well, since Scripture is our true guide, we will shoot for nothing but spiritual maturity
In fact, in Paul's farewell to the people of Corinth, he said, 'Aim for perfection'
And we also have the high aim of these words from the lips of Jesus, 'You shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect'
Perfection is a lofty target, and we won't attain it in this life
But if we want to honor God and get close to that high goal, we need to aim high.
I love reading church slogans
You know, the ones you see on the marquee in front of churches
Recently I noticed a slogan that said, 'Come in and experience the presence of God.'
That one caught my attention, primarily because it's an important promise to make and sometimes a hard promise to keep
Hard, because if we're not careful our churches might reflect the presence of its people more than the presence of our God
So what would a church have to do to display the presence of God
Its people would have to live like Him
Dynamics like hospitality, the loving acceptance of all kinds of people, a quickness to serve, a tangible love for one another that makes people feel safe and included regardless of color or class, and a patient tolerance of one another's weaknesses
all be a great way to start
Paul said we should walk in a manner 'worthy of the Lord'
And he also said that being worthy means that we will be humble, gentle, bearing with one another in love, eagerly maintaining the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace
Let's live in such a way that others will experience the presence of the God who lives in us, wherever we are, but especially at church.
Several years ago a friend took me to a motivational seminar that I thoroughly enjoyed
Instead of focusing on money and success, the leaders guided us toward understanding our unique identity and purpose in life
Then they passed along some helpful methods for effective living
One motto has stayed with me: 'Do it now!'
The principle they taught us was that it takes as much energy to avoid a task as it does to do it
Procrastination saps power; completion gives relief
A spiritual application can be seen in Hebrews 3, a passage filled with an air of immediacy as it calls us to obey the Lord
Today, if you will hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,
but exhort one another daily, while it is called '\sToday,' lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin'
We don't know how long it would have taken the children of Israel to reach the Promised Land if they had obeyed God
their 40-year journey resulted from their unwilling hearts
An entire generation missed the adventure of a lifetime
When we know how the Lord wants us to live, why don't we just say 'Yes!'
No debate, no delay
Do it now!
Caerleon is a Welsh village with deep historical roots
It was one of three sites in the United Kingdom where Roman legions were posted during Rome's occupation of Britain
While the military presence ended some 1,500 years ago, the imprint of that occupation can still be seen today
People come from all over the world to visit the military fort, the barracks, and the amphitheatre that are reminders of the days when Rome ruled the world and occupied Wales
It amazes me that 15 centuries later, the evidence of Rome's presence can still so clearly be seen in that small community
I wonder, though, about another kind of imprint, the imprint of Christ on our lives
Do we allow His presence to be clearly seen by others
Is it possible for people who interact with us to know that Jesus occupies our lives
Jesus calls us to make known His presence in our lives to the glory of God the Father
He says, 'Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven'
Through the light of our testimony and the impact of our deeds of service, people should be able to see evidence of the presence of God in our lives
Is it true
Can they see His imprint?
John is a humble, uneducated man
Yet God used him to start the peace process in Mozambique
His name is not mentioned in any official documents; all he did was arrange a meeting between two of his acquaintances Kenyan Ambassador Bethuel Kiplagat and a Mozambican
But that introduction set in motion the events that led to a peace treaty after a 10-year civil war
From that experience, Ambassador Kiplagat learned the importance of respecting everyone
'You never dismiss people because they are not educated, because they are white, because they are black, because they are women, because they are old or young
Every encounter is sacred, and we need to value that encounter,' the ambassador said
'You never know what word might be there for you.'
The Bible confirms that this is true
Naaman was a great man in Syria when he got the dreaded disease of leprosy
A servant girl whom he had captured from Israel told Naaman's wife that the prophet Elisha could heal him
Because Naaman was willing to listen to this lowly servant girl, his life was spared and he came to know the one true God
God often speaks through those to whom few are willing to listen
To hear God, be sure to listen to the humble.
Actor Christopher Reeve was para- lyzed in a horseback riding accident in 1995
Prior to this tragedy, he had played the part of a paraplegic in a movie
In preparation, Reeve visited a rehabilitation facility
He recalled: 'Every time I left that rehab center, I said, '\sThank God that's not me.'
After his accident, Reeve regretted that statement: 'I was so setting myself apart from those people who were suffering without realizing that in a second that could be me.'
And sadly, for him, it was
We too may look at the troubles of others and think that it could never happen to us
Especially if our life journey has led to a measure of success, financial security, and family harmony
In a moment of vanity and self-sufficiency, King David admitted to falling into the trap of feeling invulnerable: 'Now in my prosperity I said, '\sI shall never be moved''
But David quickly caught himself and redirected his heart away from self-sufficiency
He remembered that he had known adversity in the past and God had delivered him: 'You have turned for me my mourning into dancing'
Whether He has brought us blessing or trial, God still deserves our gratitude and trust.
One of the major obstacles to show- ing compassion is making prejudgments about who we think is worthy of our compassion
Jesus told a parable to answer the question: 'Who is my neighbor?'
Or, who qualifies as worthy of our neighborly acts
Jesus told of a man who traveled on the notoriously dangerous road from Jerusalem to Jericho
As he traveled, he fell among thieves and was robbed, beaten, and left for dead
Religious Jews passed him, but they walked by on the other side, probably for fear of being religiously defiled
But a Samaritan came along and had unconditional compassion on the wounded stranger
Jesus' audience would have gasped at this because Jews despised Samaritans
The Samaritan could have limited or qualified his compassion because the man was a Jew
But he did not limit his neighborly kindness to those he thought were worthy
Instead, he saw a human being in need and resolved to help him
Are you limiting your kindness to the ones you deem worthy
As followers of Jesus, let us find ways to show neighborly kindness to all people, especially to those we have judged as unworthy.
Rugs, lamps, a washer and dryer, even the food in the cupboards everything was for sale
My husband and I stopped at an estate sale one day and wandered through the house
We overwhelmed by the volume of belongings
Dish sets littered the dining room table
Christmas decorations filled the front hallway
Tools, toy cars, board games, and vintage dolls crowded the garage
When we left, I wondered if the homeowners were moving, if they desperately needed money, or if they had passed away
This reminded me of these words from Ecclesiastes: 'Just exactly as he came, so shall he go'
We're born empty-handed and we leave the world the same way
The stuff we buy, organize, and store is ours only for a while, and it's all in a state of decay
Moths munch through our clothes; even gold and silver may not hold their value
Sometimes 'riches perish through misfortune'
, and our kids don't get to enjoy our possessions after we're gone
Stockpiling possessions in the here-and-now is foolish, because we can't take anything with us when we die
What's important is a proper attitude toward what we have and how we use what God has given
That way we'll be storing up our treasure where it belongs, in heaven.
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me-ee
Happy bir
After humming the 'birthday song' a second time, I turned off the faucet's running water
It is said that singing the song through twice while washing your hands is a good way to remove most bacteria
But it doesn't last
I need to repeat this process each time they are contaminated
In the Old Testament, the people of God offered sacrifices over and over to cover their sins
But the blood of the animals didn't actually 'take away sins'
Only the precious sacrifice of Jesus could do that
Animal sacrifices are no longer needed because Christ's sacrifice
'was once for all, unlike animal sacrifices, which had to be offered 'continually year by year'
'cleanses us completely from all guilt and sin, unlike the blood of animals that was a reminder of sin's penalty and could never take away our sins
'By one offering [Christ] has perfected forever those who are being sanctified'
Only through Jesus can we be declared completely clean.
A young teen who was constantly getting into trouble always apologized when his parents confronted him
No matter how much he hurt his parents with his previous wrong-doing, he would soon turn around and do something else wrong knowing he would be forgiven
Finally, his dad took him out to the garage for a talk
Dad picked up a hammer and pounded a nail into the garage wall
Then he gave his son the hammer and told him to pull out the nail
The boy shrugged, grabbed the hammer, and yanked out the nail
'That's like forgiveness, Son
When you do something wrong, it's like pounding in a nail
Forgiveness is when you pull the nail out.'
'Okay, I get it,' said the boy
'Now take the hammer and pull out the nail hole,' his dad replied
'That's impossible!' the boy said
'I can't pull it out.'
As this story illustrates and King David's life proves, sin carries consequences
Even though David was forgiven, his adultery and murder left scars and led to family problems
This sobering truth can serve as a warning for our lives
The best way to avoid the lingering damage of sin is to live a life of obedience to God.
Steve often witnesses to his co- workers
But when he mentions something directly from the Bible, someone frequently responds: 'Wait
That was written by men, and it's full of errors just like any other book.'
The following letter to the editor in our local newspaper expresses a similar thought: 'Believers cite that the Word of God is infallible, but I see no apparent reason to believe that the words written in the Bible by man are any more infallible than the words written in a science journal by man.'
How do we respond when the Scriptures are so readily dismissed as being just man's words with errors
Most of us aren't biblical scholars and may not have an answer
But if we do some reading , we'll find the evidence that it's God-inspired and therefore trustworthy
For example, consider this: Over a period of 1,600 years, 40 different authors wrote the 66 books of the Bible
There were 400 silent years between the 39 books of the Old Testament and the 27 of the New Testament
Yet, Genesis to Revelation tell one unified story
While we accept the Bible by faith, there's plenty of evidence that it's true
Let's be diligent to study and share what we learn with others.
For a dozen years, I took an auto emergency kit on every long driving trip but never had to use it
It became such a familiar item that on the night we really needed it, I forgot it was there
But fortunately my wife remembered
After hitting a deer on a dark rural highway, our van was completely disabled
While I fumbled with a small flashlight to assess the damage and call a tow truck, my wife opened the emergency kit
She set out a reflective warning marker, then turned on the bright flashlight
It is much to my surprise
Later we talked about how a crisis can cause us to forget the resources we have, just when we need them most
Paul urged the Ephesians to 'put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil'
This protective covering includes truth, righteousness, readiness, faith, salvation, and prayer
Although these spiritual resources guard us each day, we need to remember them when disaster strikes and the enemy tries to undermine our confidence in God's love and care
Use the kit
'Take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand'
After his return from the moon, Neil Armstrong was often plagued by the media
Seeking greater privacy, he moved his family into a small town
But notoriety was a nuisance even there
Armstrong's barber found out that people would pay good money to get a lock of his hair
So after giving the space hero several haircuts, he sold the clippings to a buyer for $3,000
Armstrong was shocked at the barber's opportunism
The Scriptures tell of another story of disloyalty and a haircut
As a symbol of God's calling of Samson as a Nazirite, he was never to cut his hair
When the Spirit of God came upon him, he was given super-human strength over his enemies
Wanting to overpower him, the Philistines hired Delilah, a woman who had a relationship with him, to find out the secret of that strength
He foolishly told her that his power would be gone if his hair were cut
She lulled him to sleep and had him shorn
Greed can drive us to be disloyal to others and to God, causing us to make sinful choices
Our desire should be to exhibit a heart that is fully committed to love the Lord and others
He shows 'Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him'
Adults celebrate when children learn to do something on their own: get dressed, brush their teeth, tie shoelaces, ride a bike, walk to school
As adults, we like to pay our own way, live in our own houses, make our own decisions, rely on no outside help
Faced with an unexpected challenge, we seek out 'self-help' books
All the while we are systematically sealing off the heart attitude most desirable to God and most descriptive of our true state in the universe
It's what Jesus told His disciples: 'Without Me you can do nothing'
The truth is that we live in a web of dependence, at the center of which is God, in whom all things hold together
Norwegian theologian Ole Hallesby settled on the single word helplessness as the best summary of the heart attitude that God accepts as prayer
He said, 'Only he who is helpless can truly pray.'
Most parents feel a pang when the child outgrows dependence, even while knowing the growth to be healthy and normal
With God, the rules change
We never outgrow dependence, and to the extent we think we do, we delude ourselves
Prayer is our declaration of dependence upon the Lord.
Our yard makes poison ivy happy
I learned this the hard way
Even though I was being careful, I came in contact with the plant and ended up with a nasty, itchy rash
Poison ivy looks like many harmless plants, and it keeps company with some beautiful ones
One gardener couldn't figure out why she got poison ivy whenever she pruned her roses
She later discovered that a poison ivy vine was taking advantage of the tender loving care she gave to her rosebush
Some people are like toxic plants
They look harmless, and they blend in with people who, like roses, are fragrant and beautiful
Simon the sorcerer fit this description
He followed Philip and was baptized, but then he asked to buy the ability to lay hands on people so they could receive the Holy Spirit
Peter was appalled at his request and urged him to repent
Sometimes people use the favorable environment of a healthy church as a network for selfish purposes
Like poison ivy among roses, they cause much misery
Like Simon, anyone who does this needs to repent, and everyone else needs to avoid contact with such a person
Spiritual look-alikes appear good but their 'fruit' is toxic.
I can still remember what it was like to take our family on vacation, only to have the kids in the backseat mar the joy of it all by their bickering and complaining
Who doesn't remember the disruptive effects of 'Dad, she touched me!'
or 'Mom, he won't give me a turn!'
If you've had that kind of experience, you can imagine how God feels when His children quarrel and complain
Getting along is important to God
Jesus prayed that we would 'be one'
so that the world would believe He came from the Father
And to disciples who were prone to quarreling, He commanded that they love and serve one another
It should also be noted that among the seven things God hates, He includes 'one who sows discord among brethren'
So I'm not surprised that the psalmist tells us that when brothers dwell in unity, it's like 'the precious oil upon the head, running down on the beard of Aaron, running down on the edge of his garments'
In ancient times, the oil of anointing was full of fragrant spices that graced the environment wherever the anointed one went
May the unity that comes from our love and service to one another fragrantly grace our families, churches, and friendships!
A while back, Our Daily Bread  published an article I wrote about a young woman who wore a T-shirt that said, 'Love Is for Losers.'
In it, I commented on what a sad message that was, and I wrote about the hurt this motto represented
To my surprise, one of our readers gave that message a completely different slant
She sent a note informing me that her daughter and her daughter's friends all tennis players wear shirts with that slogan
In tennis, a 'love' score is zero
If your score in a game is 'love' you lose so in tennis, love really is for losers
That mom's note gave me a new perspective on that saying
This incident reminded me how easy it is to make wrong first judgments
Based on incomplete or inaccurate information, we can jump to wrong conclusions and make poor value judgments about people and situations
And that can cause great hurt to others
Speaking to people who had misjudged Him, Jesus warned, 'Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment'
We need to be careful that our judgments are backed up by the right information and the right attitude
Try this motto: 'Righteous judgment is for winners.'
North America's Pacific Coast Redwoods are some of the biggest trees in the world
The tallest on record, Hyperion, soars 379 feet into the air
During a visit to California's Muir Woods National Park, I was surprised and overwhelmed by the enormity of those redwoods
Trees as tall as a 30- story building seemed to press me into the forest floor while drawing my thoughts upward
The memory of what I felt at the base of some of the tallest and oldest trees in the world has left me with lingering thoughts about their origin
Those redwoods, like the family tree of our own humanity, are rooted in a Creator who is infinitely and eternally greater than His creation
The prophet Isaiah caught a glimpse of this God
In a vision that mingled the wonders of a Messianic kingdom with the promise of a new heaven and earth, he describes One who makes the skies His throne and the earth His footstool
Yet Isaiah saw something even more overwhelming
He saw a great God who wants His people to 'be glad and rejoice forever in what I create'
In response, let's bow before Him in humble adoration .
In some homes, owners have built safe rooms, special places where they can go for protection should someone break into the house
In Proverbs 18:10, Solomon reminded God's people that God is their 'safe room' and that they could find total security in Him
In verses 10 and 11, he described two types of security to which some people run: the name of the Lord and wealth
The name or character of God is described as a 'strong tower.'
As a captured city might take refuge in a fortified tower, so the righteous could run to the Lord and find complete safety
On the other hand, the wealthy imagined their riches as a high point of safety
Solomon sought to tell his readers that money might give a sense of security but it would be a false security that could lead to laziness, pride, and destruction
Yet people who are humble and find their complete security in the unchanging and holy character of God will find true safety
Wealth may not be your particular 'safe room.'
You might tend to run instead to something or someone else when adversity comes
But we all need to learn to depend daily on the Lord and find a high point of safety in the safe room of His name.
When I was a kid, I learned a big word that was fun to pronounce: 'antidisestablishmentarianism.'
What a mouthful
I recently took the time to look it up
The dictionary defines it as 'the doctrine or political position that opposes the withdrawal of state recognition of an established church.'
The definition is almost as difficult as the term itself
Neither I nor my school friends knew what it meant
But using the big word made me look knowledgeable
When the apostle Paul ministered to people, he didn't try to impress others
In his letter to the Corinthians, he wrote: 'When I came to you, [I] did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God'
'Excellence of speech' is the translation of Greek words meaning 'high-sounding words' or 'pompous speech.'
This implies using words to exalt self instead of to instruct others
Paul was a brilliant scholar who expressed the deep things of God in Scripture
Yet he did not use lofty language to elevate his self-importance
As we grow in our understanding of God's Word, let's follow Paul's example and guard against parading knowledge for knowledge's sake
Instead, let's use well-chosen words that build up and encourage others.
In August 1914, when Britain entered World War I, Oswald Chambers was 40 years old with a wife and a 1-year-old daughter
It wasn't long before men were joining the army at the rate of 30,000 a day, people were asked to sell their automobiles and farm horses to the government, and lists of the dead and wounded began appearing in daily newspapers
The nation faced economic uncertainty and peril
A month into the war, Chambers spoke of the spiritual challenge facing followers of Christ: 'We must take heed that in the present calamities, when war and devastation and heart-break are abroad in the world, we do not shut ourselves up in a world of our own and ignore the demand made on us by our Lord and our fellowmen for the service of intercessory prayer and hospitality and care.'
God's call to His people rings true in every age: 'If you extend your soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul, then your light shall dawn in the darkness, and your darkness shall be as the noonday'
Fear causes us to grasp what we have; faith in God opens our hands and hearts to others
We walk in His light when we help others, not hoard for ourselves.
The Energizer Bunny can't top the Service Partners of RBC Ministries
RBC, the publishers of Our Daily Bread, has a volunteer program called Service Partners 
This program gives people the opportunity to donate their skills and time helping us accomplish our mission 'to make the life-changing wisdom of the Bible understandable and accessible to all.'
Some of the Service Partners are well past retirement age
Despite the aches, pains, and limitations of advancing age, they show up regularly and serve cheerfully at a variety of tasks
In 2009, they completed 100,000 hours in service since the program's inception
They just keep going and going  not unlike the famous pink bunny
Their example is a reminder that there is no 'use by' date on our earthly lives
Scripture doesn't designate a retirement age for believers
But there is an end product for our service one unrelated to age
In describing the results of the efforts of 'pastors and teachers,'
Paul says their purpose is to equip 'the saints for the work of ministry'
And that 'work of ministry,' which is the job of all believers, can lead to 'the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God'
This task should 'keep us going' for the rest of our lives.
On a whim, I bought a red foil balloon at the grocery store
The message 'I Love You' streamed across the front in billowy script
As I was loading bags into my car, the balloon's string slid through my fingers
I stood there watching it float away, and soon it was nothing more than a tiny red dot finally, just a memory
Losing that balloon reminded me of the way love sometimes vanishes from lives
Children rebel and distance themselves; spouses or loved ones desert; close friends stop calling
I'm so thankful that God's love is steady; it can sustain us when love here on earth drifts away
In fact, it's so reliable that Jesus invites us to abide in His love
He wants us to know it's okay to settle in and get comfortable
We can always remain in God's tender embrace because 'neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come' , or anything else, can ever separate us from His love through Christ
Once we trust Christ as Savior, the guarantee of God's love is ours forever
Have you watched love disappear from your life
Rest in God's affection His constant care will keep your heart safely secured.
Despite my best efforts to write clearly, sometimes I'm misunderstood
I feel bad about my failure and try to improve my skills
Occasionally, however, readers take words out of context or read into them something that bears no resemblance to the intended meaning
This is frustrating because there's no way to control how people use words once they are published
This brings to mind a much more serious offense, that of misusing the words of the Lord
The prophets in Jeremiah's day did this
They put their own words into God's mouth by claiming He said things they wanted to be true but that God had never said
So the Lord told His people, 'Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you
They speak a vision of their own heart, not from the mouth of the Lord'
Then the Lord warned the people that He would forsake those who pervert His words and cast them from His presence
In contrast, the apostle Paul made a point of saying that he did not handle the Word of God deceitfully
He knew the danger of preaching his own ideas rather than God's
All of us need to be careful to use God's Word for His purpose, rather than for our own agenda.
I told my doctor who is an agnostic that he should be glad God created us
Seeing a needle in his hands, I wondered, Perhaps I should keep quiet
But I added, 'If we are still evolving, then you wouldn't know the exact spots to place those needles.'
He asked, 'Do you really believe in God?'
I replied, 'Of course
Aren't we intricately made?'
I was thankful for this opportunity to begin to witness to my doctor
In today's Bible reading, Paul charged Timothy to point people to the Savior
'Preach the Word' is not addressed only to preachers, however
The word preach means 'to make it known.'
God's people can do this over a cup of coffee or in school with friends
We can make known the good news of what God has done for us wherever, whenever, and to anyone who is open and seeking
We can let them know that God loves us and sees our hurts, failures, and weaknesses
Through the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus, God broke the stranglehold of sin over us
And to all those who will open their heart to the Savior, He will come to live in them
Let's not be afraid to make known what God has done for us.
In the 1930s, jockey Johnny Longden was rammed in mid-race
While thundering steeds came up from behind, Johnny was thrown sideways off his horse
Seeing his predicament, another jockey reached out and attempted to push Longden back up on his mount
Unfortunately, he pushed too hard and Longden flew over the horse onto the other side
Still another jockey nearby grabbed him and was able to help him safely back on his horse
Amazingly, Johnny Longden won the race
A newspaper dubbed it 'the ultimate impossibility.'
Helping hands had not only saved him from severe injury and possible death, but allowed him to win the race
As believers, we are to offer a helping hand to others as well
In Proverbs 31, we read of the virtuous woman who 'extends her hand to the poor, yes, she reaches out her hands to the needy'
For centuries, the compassion of this woman of faith has been an inspiration to both men and women
She helps to remind us that extending ourselves to others is a biblical virtue to be exhibited by all believers
There are many who are struggling or have fallen on hard times and need our assistance
Who in your life needs a helping hand?
When people ask Michael St Jacques, a Franciscan brother, what he's wearing, he says, 'It's called a habit.'
He wears the distinctive brown robe for a definite reason
St Jacques told Hemispheres magazine, 'We have the choice to wear it, and a lot of us make a real effort to because it acts as a magnet
People tell me things they've never told anyone
Complete strangers will confess something they did 30 years ago and ask if God can forgive them.'
You might say that Michael is clothed in 'approachability.'
Throughout the Gospels, we find that all types of people approached Jesus wherever He went
They came to be taught, helped, healed, accepted, and forgiven
When some criticized Jesus for associating with tax collectors and sinners, people they considered undesirable, Jesus said, 'Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick
I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance'
Do people see us as aloof or accessible
When we become so focused on our own plans that we have no time for others, we are not clothed with the spirit of Christ
When the Savior lives through us, His open arms invite people to open their hearts and unburden their souls.
Why do some trees turn into a collage of radiant maroon, red, orange, and yellow colors in the fall
Trees are green in the summer because chlorophyll, a green pigment in the leaves, absorbs red and blue light from the sun
The light reflected from the leaves appears green to our eyes
Chlorophyll is an unstable substance, and bright sunlight causes it to decompose rapidly
Therefore, plants must continuously synthesize and regenerate it
The shortening days and cool nights of autumn, however, interfere with this process
As chlorophyll breaks down, the green colors of the leaves begin to fade
Some trees change from green to bright yellow as the chlorophyll degrades
In others, the action of sugar in the leaves creates a red pigment, causing the leaves to turn maroon, purple, and bright red as the chlorophyll fades
But why do we have color
It seems to serve no practical purpose at least none that scientists can discern
And why are there photoreceptors in our eyes that enable us to see it
I believe that God's goodness is the point of His creation
He is 'good to all, and His tender mercies are over all His works'
He colored the world for our childlike delight
He's like that, you know.
What's the first image you see when you turn on your computer
Maybe it's a family portrait or a special vacation picture
Or perhaps your favorite pro athlete
How about an artist's rendition of Jesus
A man once wrote to me about his lengthy battle with pornography a disheartening cycle that punctuated seasons of victory with crushing forays back into an online world of empty lust
Finally, he found that putting a visible reminder of Jesus in the corner of his computer screen helped him achieve lasting victory
That constant reminder of the One who set him free caused the offensive Web sites to lose their appeal
The man wasn't tapping into some gigabyte good-luck charm
He was giving himself a simple reminder of the teaching of Colossians 3 where Paul says, 'put to death fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness'
When we turn our eyes toward Jesus, He becomes a powerful reminder that our old life 'died, and [our] life is hidden with Christ in God'
Whether it's a verse taped to the dashboard of your car or a picture on your computer, choose a tangible way to lift your thoughts into the presence of Jesus.
Popularity is fickle
Just ask a politician
Many of them watch their ratings to see how their constituents view their policies
They may start with a high rating, but then it steadily declines during their term
Jesus also experienced a sharp decline in popularity
His popularity reached its peak after He fed the 5,000
It plummeted when He told His listeners that He had 'come down from heaven'
Their response to His stupendous claim was, essentially, Who does this guy think He is?
Jesus' popularity continued to dip when He explained how they could have Him as spiritual bread
Perplexed by what they heard, they said, 'This is a hard saying; who can understand it?'
As a result, many left Him
The crowds followed Jesus conditionally
They were happy only as long as Jesus supplied their needs and met their wants
They balked when He asked for commitment
Jesus' question to His disciples was 'Do you also want to go away?'
Peter answered, 'Lord, to whom shall we go
You have the words of eternal life'
Will you, like Peter, choose to ignore the world's rating of Jesus and follow Him daily?
If we're not careful, we may become like the man who prided himself on being an expert archer
The secret to his success was that after he shot his arrow at the side of a barn, he painted a bull's-eye around the arrow
It's easy to live our lives doing what we want and thinking that our ways and instincts are right on target
when in reality our 'bull's-eye' shots at life are not on target at all
Proverbs 14:12 says, 'There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.'
Sometimes it may feel right to seek revenge, hoard money, chase pleasure, or yell at people who yell at us
But God's ways are different from ours
He has painted a bull's-eye on forgiving those who have hurt us, on giving generously to those in need, on living to please Him rather than ourselves, and on turning the other cheek
We need to pray, 'Teach me Your way, O Lord; I will walk in Your truth'
And then we need to aim to follow His ways in all that we do and say
But we all need help to aim at the right target
Thankfully, the bull's-eye is already painted in the brushstrokes of God's truth as revealed in His Word
When we aim our lives at God's Word, we'll discover that His ways are right on target, every time!
Our church's young people did what they could to 'construct heaven.'
It was time for the spring banquet, and the creative teens used lights, Styrofoam, and other materials to turn the auditorium into their best idea of heaven
The theme of the banquet was 'I Can Only Imagine,' from the song by MercyMe
Our daughter Melissa helped transform the church
When I visited to see how the kids were doing, she was in the rafters hanging stars
The night of the banquet, my wife and I were able to hear one of Melissa's friends sing the theme song as we all thought about this faraway place called heaven
Of course, we never could have imagined that Melissa would be entering the real heaven just 6 weeks later
The imaginary would become reality
Jesus told us about heaven as a way of untroubling our hearts
He said, 'Let not your heart be troubled;
in My Father's house are many mansions
I go to prepare a place for you'
Heaven is a prepared place for prepared hearts, a place of unimaginable beauty, splendor, and majesty
It's where God is caring for our believing loved ones, and someday for us
Imagine heaven, and rejoice!
The waves of Lake Michigan were high and splashing onto the pier one day as I followed a young family out to a lighthouse
I overheard the young girl say to her father: 'Daddy, please walk alongside me and hold my hand at this scary part.'
Sometimes life can be scary for us too: Loss of loved ones, Financial woes, Health problems
As we carry these heavy burdens and cares, we long for a strong hand to hold ours to keep us steady and secure
When Joshua took over the leadership of Israel, Moses reminded him of God's help in tough times
In the difficult days to come, Joshua would need to remember to trust God and His promises
Moses said, 'The Lord, He is the One who goes before you
He will be with you, He will not leave you nor forsake you; do not fear nor be dismayed'
Isaiah 41:13 encourages us with these words from God: 'I, the Lord your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you, '\sFear not, I will help you.'
This song by Lowell Alexander reminds us of God's presence: 'You will face mountains so steep, deserts so long, and valleys so deep
Sometimes the journey's gentle, sometimes the cold winds blow
But I want you to remember, I want you to know you will never walk alone
Jesus will be right beside you all the way.'
He'll walk alongside us and hold our hand at the 'scary' parts.
In his book The First Man, James Hansen chronicles Neil Armstrong's flight to the moon
The author explains how each astronaut was asked to fill out a report upon completion of the flight
The report listed how they traveled from Houston, Texas, to Cape Kennedy, Florida, to the Moon, to the Pacific Ocean, to Hawaii, and returned to Houston, Texas
What a list of destinations
There is another itinerary that outshines any trip ever taken
Imagine this itinerary of our Savior, Jesus Christ: Place of origin the heavenly places; Initial destination Bethlehem; Mode of travel the virgin birth; Reason for travel the redemption of sinners; Return destination, the right hand of the Father
Philippians 2:5-11 eloquently describes Christ's coming to earth to provide our redemption
One Bible commentator considers this passage a hymn of praise to the glory of the Suffering Servant who became exalted for His obedience: 'Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God, humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death
Therefore God also has highly exalted Him'
Our Lord's extraordinary itinerary of redemption should fill our hearts with gratitude and praise!
On a recent radio program, the hosts spoke with a 'crisis management' expert about how a celebrity can recover from a public relations disaster
This specialist said one of the keys was to build strong allies who can help the star rehabilitate his or her image
In other words, it is vital when in trouble to get the right help
That is wise counsel, for at the heart of all crisis management is recognizing that we can't accomplish everything on our own
Some challenges are too big
Some mountains are too high
In our own seasons of crisis, it is critical that we have help
That's why it's comforting to know that we have the strongest ally possible
King David knew about that ally
In Psalm 18:6, he affirmed, 'In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried out to my God; 
He heard my voice from His temple, and my cry came before Him, even to His ears.'
There is no greater help in our time of need than God
He alone can carry us through the trials and crises of life, and we have His word that He will never leave us nor forsake us
When crisis hits, we don't have to stand alone
We have the right help
We can depend on God to be the greatest ally we could ever know
Lean on Him.
People who are trying to be friendly sometimes ask, 'Are you keeping busy?'
The question seems harmless, but in my mind it carries a subtle message
Beneath the surface is a test of personal value
If I can't rattle off a list of things I have to do, I feel as if I'm admitting that I'm not worth much
But does God determine our value by how busy we are
Does He calculate our worth by how much we accomplish
Does He reward us for living on the edge of exhaustion and not taking care of ourselves
One of the first verses I learned as a child was Matthew 11:28, 'Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.'
It didn't mean much to me at the time because I didn't understand weariness
But now that I'm older, I feel the temptation to keep pace with the world so I won't be left behind
But followers of Jesus don't have to live like that
Not only has He released us from slavery to sin but also from the bondage of having to prove our worth
Accomplishing a lot for God may make us feel important, but what makes us important to God is what we allow Him to accomplish in us conforming us into the image of His Son .
Many churches celebrate the first Sunday in October as World Communion Sunday
It is a time to observe the Lord's Supper with a special awareness of celebrating together with our brothers and sisters in Christ around the globe
On this day, being with a community of believers has become very meaningful to me
One year, however, I found myself in an airport with a long flight ahead and no opportunity to attend church on that day
Sitting alone, I read the Gospel accounts of the Last Supper, along with the passages describing Jesus' arrest and crucifixion
Then from 1 Corinthians 11:23-26, I pondered the words so often read at communion services: 'The Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread
With some common elements to represent the bread and the cup, I observed the Lord's death for us, feeling a deep kinship with those followers of Christ in many places who are unable or forbidden to gather with others in worship
Whatever your location and circumstances today, may you find joy and strength in remembering the Lord's sacrifice on the cross
'For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death till He comes'
Remember when phones were for making phone calls
With the advent of the smart phone, what was once a way to talk to someone has become a storehouse of data
Add cell-phone applications to that, and you can read sports reports, play games, plan trips, find an apartment, or any of well over 100,000 other tasks available with an 'app.'
That's pretty amazing, but the 'apps' for phones are nothing compared with the kind of 'apps' Scripture gives us
The 'applications' of the Bible are direct notes from God telling us how to apply the truth of His Word to all of life
Take Philippians 2, for instance: The unity app , the humility app , the no-grumbling app , the shine-as-lights app
Or look at the apps of Ephesians 5: The imitate-God app , the walk-in-love app , the purity app , the tongue app
And the book of Proverbs
It's teeming with applications
You don't have to wait for someone to offer these on the Internet
Just open the Bible and see the hundreds of ways to apply Scripture in your life
Got a question about the Christian life
Search the Bible
The answers are there, waiting to be discovered.
Because I am not a 'fix it' kind of guy, I had to call a friend who is a great handyman to make some repairs in my home recently
He came over, and I gave him my list
But to my surprise, he told me I would be doing the repairs myself
He modeled for me how to do it, instructed me along the way, and stayed with me
I followed his example and successfully made the repairs
This modeling seems close to what Jesus did when He called His first disciples
When Jesus called those men to follow Him, He wanted them to be with Him and to teach the good news of the kingdom of God
The first job would require being under the immediate super-vision of Jesus learning His words and interpretation of the Scriptures and watching His behavior
For the second task, Jesus sent them out to preach , saying what He said and doing what He did
As they carried out these tasks, they were to be dependent on Jesus
Today, Jesus is still calling His followers to this simple, yet powerful process of discipleship being with Him
Are you one who is dependent on Him as you're following Him today?
Several years ago, my husband helped to lead a work crew of high school students on a short-term missions trip to a Christian school in an urban community
Unfortunately, Tom had broken his foot shortly before the trip and was supervising the work from a wheelchair
He was discouraged because he wasn't able to get around as he had hoped
While he was working on the ground floor, a few of the girls were painting on the third floor
He could hear them singing praise choruses in harmony as their voices echoed down the wide-open staircases
Song after song ministered to him
'It was the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard,' he told me later
'And it lifted my spirits.'
Colossians 3 reminds us, 'Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord'
Not only were those teenage girls giving sweet praise to God, they were ministering to a co-worker
Whatever you're doing today, cultivate an attitude of praise
Whether it is through song or conversation, let your joy in the Lord reverberate to others
You never know who you might encourage.
The people of Israel had backslidden, and God wanted Hosea to show them how much that hurt Him
So, in the first few chapters of Hosea, we read a bizarre story: God commanded the prophet to marry a prostitute named Gomer
Put on display as the faithful husband of an unfaithful spouse, Hosea experienced a pain similar to what God felt when Israel was spiritually unfaithful
As Hosea wrote the ending of his book, he made it clear that despite the pain the people of Israel caused the living God, He still promised healing, forgiveness, and fruitfulness if they would return to Him: 'I will heal their backsliding,'
He said 'I will love them freely
Those who dwell under his shadow shall return'
Life for the person who turns his back on God is often characterized by guilt and dissatisfaction
The truly born-again believer who has fallen into a lifestyle of sin knows deep down that spiritual unfaithfulness to God takes a toll
But just as the God of grace offered Israel forgiveness and fruitfulness, even so today He offers restoration to the truly repentant
Have you made poor choices that have caused you to slip away
Come back
Repent and seek restored fellowship with the Lord today.
When we think about the marvel of creation, how God spoke the universe into existence and formed the earth and everything in it we think most often of Old Testament accounts
But it is encouraging to examine the New Testament to see how that part of the Bible refers to creation
Here is a look at some key passages: 'I will utter things kept secret from the foundation of the world'
God reveals things to us that He had kept secret since before creation
'Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world'
Before the earth was created, God knew each of us, and He knew our future
'He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world'
Before the work of creation even began, God was aware of each of His eventual children
These New Testament verses comfort us with the truth that God's knowledge of us and His eternal mysteries about us point toward His special creation of mankind as described in Genesis
We can do nothing but bow in awe before One whose knowledge and creative ability are eternal in nature and boundless in power
Creation: New Testament style still another reason to give God praise!
In the New Testament, hospitality is a hallmark of Christian living
It is listed as a characteristic of church leaders and is commanded for every follower of Jesus as an expression of love
But its meaning goes deeper than being a gracious host or opening our homes to guests
The Greek word translated 'hospitality'
means 'love of strangers.'
When Paul speaks of being 'given to hospitality'
, he is calling us to pursue relationships with people who are in need
It is not an easy task
Writer Henri Nouwen likens it to reaching out to those we meet on our way through life people who may be estranged from their culture, country, friends, family, or even from God
Nouwen writes: 'Hospitality, therefore, means primarily the creation of a free space where the stranger can enter and become a friend instead of an enemy
Hospitality is not to change people, but to offer them space where change can take place.'
Whether we inhabit a home, a college dorm, a prison cell, or a military barracks, we can welcome others as a way of showing our love for them and for Christ
Hospitality is making room for people in need.
People around the world are familiar with Mount Rushmore
The South Dakota site where the heads of former American presidents are carved in gigantic scale on a cliff wall
Yet, while millions know of Mount Rushmore, relatively few know the name Doane Robinson the South Dakota state historian who conceived the idea of the magnificent sculpture and managed the project
The monument is admired and appreciated, but he is the forgotten man behind the masterpiece
His name is largely unrecognized or was never even known by some
Sometimes, in the service of the Master, we may feel that we have been forgotten or are behind the scenes and not recognized
Ministry can be a life of effort that often goes unappreciated by the very people we are seeking to serve in Jesus' name
The good news, however, is that, while people may not know, God does
Hebrews 6:10 says, 'For God is not unjust to forget your work and labor of love which you have shown toward His name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.'
What a promise
Our heavenly Father will never forget our service to Him
That is infinitely more important than being applauded by the crowds.
My husband and I rode the train backward from Grand Rapids to Chicago last summer
Sitting in seats that faced the rear of the train
all we could see was where we had been, not where we were going
Buildings, lakes, and trees flew by the window after we had passed them
I didn't like it
I'd rather see where I'm going
Sometimes we may feel that way about life too wishing we could see ahead
We'd like to know how certain situations are going to turn out, how God is going to answer our prayers
But all we can know is where we've been
That is, if it were not for faith
The 'faith chapter'
of the Bible, Hebrews 11, tells us about two realities that some people in Old Testament times could see by faith
It speaks of Noah, Abraham, and Sarah, who all died in faith, 'having seen [the promises] afar off.'
They 'embraced them'
and looked forward to 'a better heavenly country'
Besides the promise of heaven, verse 27 tells us that by faith Moses could also see 'Him who is invisible,' meaning Christ
While we don't know the outcome of today's struggles, believers in Jesus can by faith see forward to where we're going: We will have a heavenly home where we will live with Jesus forever.
I read about Captain Ray Baker who flew for the Strategic Air Command during the Vietnam War
The Air Force trained him, along with the other pilots, to run out of their barracks to their planes at the sound of a buzzer
Many times during dinner he had to drop his utensils and bolt to his bomber
He had been trained to respond to the call with immediate obedience
He was so well-trained that one day while on furlough, he ran out of a restaurant when he heard a buzzer
When Jesus called His first followers, they had an immediacy in their response to His call
The call of these fishermen was abrupt
Yet 'they immediately left their nets and followed Him'
The author of this account, Mark, may have wanted to impress upon his readers the authority of Jesus
When He extended the call, these men jumped to obey because helping people enter the kingdom of God was a more compelling adventure and a grander vision than catching fish
When Jesus issues a call to follow Him, He doesn't want us to delay
He expects immediate obedience when it comes to telling others the good news
Bring someone the story of salvation today!
The writer of Proverbs describes an unwise person as 'one who speaks like the piercings of a sword'
Our tongues can be like a multi-bladed Swiss Army knife when it comes to the variety of ways that we cut and destroy each other
Unhealthy attitudes of anger, irritation, frustration, and impatience even disappointment, stress, guilt, and insecurity all contribute to our damaging speech
And as we cut with our words, we wound and divide friendships and relationships
It's no wonder that the infamous list of seven things that are an abomination to the Lord includes anyone who 'sows discord among brethren'
How do we stay off that list
For starters, we need to watch what we say
Gossip and slander are out, and words that hurt instead of heal are not welcome
Boasting, lying, and all the rest of the ways we use words to hurt and divide need to be gone as well
In their place, words that extend love and the healing power of forgiveness, mercy, and truth should rule our words and relationships
After all, where would we be if Jesus hadn't spoken words of forgiving love and grace to us
So, put the 'knife'
away and use your words to help and heal.
Trust, but verify.'
My husband loves that quote from Ronald Reagan
During his time in office, the former US President wanted to believe everything he was told in his political dealings with others
But since the security of his country depended on the truth being told he strived to verify everything
Acts 17:11 tells us that the Bereans had a similar attitude about knowing the truth
'They received the Word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.'
In other words, the Bereans didn't simply believe what someone else was telling them
They also verified it on their own, on a daily basis
That's important for us to consider as well
Whether we receive our Bible teaching through church, Sunday school, radio, or TV we need to test what we hear against God's inspired Word
We are to 'be diligent to present [ourselves] approved to God, 
rightly dividing the Word of truth'
If we do this, we won't become prey to those who teach 'a different gospel,' and those who 'want to pervert the gospel of Christ' false teachers who come as wolves in sheep's clothing
Remember, trust but verify!
Have you ever wondered how an airplane pilot knows how to get from point A to point B
Most likely, he uses VOR, short for VHF Omni-directional Radio Range, a navigational system invented in the early 1950s
It still guides many aircraft to their destination today
The pilot sets the course of the aircraft on his dial
If the aircraft drifts from that set course, the instrument shows the pilot that the plane is deviating
so he can correct it to align the aircraft to the set course again
The nation of Israel in Isaiah's day badly needed a reliable VOR system
And God wanted to be that for them
But despite God's warning, they decided to align with Egypt
God graciously promised that one day, however, He would be their navigator: 'Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, '\sThis is the way, walk in it.' Whenever you turn to the right hand or whenever you turn to the left'
Today, Christians have an internal navigational system
Jesus sent the Holy Spirit, who lives in us to 'guide [us] into all truth'
If you need direction as to where to set the course of your life, don't rely on your own way
Use God's VOR system
He will surely lead you in the right direction.
Maggie doesn't care much for television
She would rather look out a window than stare at a small screen
Reading doesn't thrill her either
She has been known to 'chew' on books, but only in the strictly literal sense
Nevertheless, when Jay and I read or watch TV, Maggie participates
Even though she doesn't enjoy what we're doing, she enjoys being with us
Maggie is our very devoted dog
More than anything Maggie wants to be with us
The word dogged means 'determined and persistent.'
These words describe Maggie
They should also describe us
When we are devoted to God, we want to be with Him even when He's doing something that makes no sense to us
We may ask, 'Why, Lord?'
when He seems angry or when He seems to be napping , or when the wicked prosper
But when we remain devoted to God despite our questions, we find fullness of joy in His presence
Jesus knew that we would have questions
To prepare us for them, He urged us to abide in His love
Even when God's ways are inexplicable, His love is reliable
So we remain doggedly devoted to Him.
The word Ebenezer in the hymn 'Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing' refers to a time when the people of Israel were trying to regain the close relationship they once had with God
Their spiritual leader, Samuel, told them that if they would abandon their foreign gods and return to the Lord wholeheartedly, He would deliver them from being oppressed by their enemy, the Philistines
When the people turned from their sin, God gave them victory
In response, 'Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer, saying, '\sThus far the Lord has helped us'
When we sing, 'Here I raise my Ebenezer; hither by Thy help I've come; and I hope, by Thy good pleasure, safely to arrive at home,'
we are reminded that in our times of need we can always turn to God to find forgiveness and help
Whatever we have done, wherever we have wandered, He will receive and restore us by His grace
A small stone on a desk or shelf can be our own Ebenezer a powerful, visible reminder that by God's help we have come this far in life, and He will see us through to the end.
I was at my grandson's eighth-grade football game when the referee indicated there was a penalty and stopped play
Apparently, after the ball was thrown, the boy who passed it was tackled, prompting a penalty flag
The announcer from the press box said: 'There is a flag on the field
The penalty is roughing the pastor, I mean, roughing the passer.'
As soon as he said it, I thought to myself, God could give that penalty to some churches today
It's not that pastors are perfect
If that is what we are looking for, then pastorless churches would be the norm
It's that God calls on us to honor those who lead us spiritually, particularly 'those who labor in preaching and teaching'
In my opinion, pastoring is one of the hardest occupations on the planet
We live in a sophisticated, fast-paced, and complex world, and our expectations for 'high-performance' pastors often set the bar at unattainable heights
So, let's switch the focus and become high-performance church members who honor our pastors with words of encouragement and prayer
A supportive note or a 'thank you' in the foyer will go a long way to stimulate pastors to serve with joy and efficiency.
In 1945, professional golfer Byron Nelson had an unimaginable season
Of the 30 tournaments he entered, he won an amazing 18 times including 11 in a row
Had he chosen to, he could have continued his career and perhaps become the greatest of all time
But that was not his goal
His goal was to earn enough money playing golf to buy a ranch and spend his life doing what he really loved
So, instead of continuing on at the peak of his career, Nelson retired at age 34 to become a rancher
He had different goals
The world may find that kind of thinking to be foolish
It doesn't really understand the heart that looks beyond trying to gain more wealth or fame to real satisfaction and contentment
This is especially true when it comes to our choice to live for Christ
But it is in the world's perception of our alleged foolishness that we might best represent the Master's different goals to this world
Paul wrote, 'But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty'
A commitment to living according to kingdom values might brand us as foolish in the eyes of the world, but it can bring honor to our God.
Growing up around the woods and waters of Midwest America, I've been fascinated with natural wildlife native to our region
But on a recent trip to the California coast, I found myself staring in breathtaking wonder at snorting elephant seals, barking sea lions, and a forest of silent redwoods
I watched pelicans soar in formation, and I saw migrating whales spouting in the distance
Together they are just a sampling of the millions of species that make up the intricate and delicate balance of nature
According to the Bible, the variety of the natural world is designed to do far more than inspire childlike wonder
The mysteries of nature can help us come to terms with a God who allows inexpressible, unexplainable pain and suffering
We see this in the epic story of Job
While he was suffering, Job didn't know that God had such a high regard for him that he allowed Satan to test his faith with a series of losses
What emerges is this eventual, unavoidable conclusion: A Creator who has the wisdom and power to design the wonders of nature is great enough to be trusted with pain and suffering that are beyond our ability to understand
In awe, Job proclaimed, 'I know that You can do everything'
We can trust that kind of God, no matter what.
One of the coolest things hanging on the wall in my home office is a Certificate of Authenticity
It has on it the logo of US Space Shuttle flight 110, which was launched in April 2002
Aboard the Atlantis on that flight was Mission Specialist Rex Walheim, who took into outer space an article from Our Daily Bread titled 'Seeing God's Glory.'
Lt Col Walheim sent me the certificate to prove that this devotional page actually left earth's atmosphere
Sometimes we need these kinds of things, documents that verify truth
If I were to show that article to someone and say, 'This flew on the Space Shuttle,'
I could be doubted because I would have no proof
But when Walheim sent me the Certificate of Authenticity, he gave me verification
In 1 Peter, Simon Peter created a Certificate of Authenticity for his message about the grace of God
In chapter 5, he wrote, 'I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this [letter] is the true grace of God'
Peter was assuring his readers that the many messages of 1 Peter themes of hope and courage and even suffering were all authentic and demonstrate the grace of God
Looking for evidence of God's grace
Read 1 Peter, and be confident that its teaching is the real deal.
After dinner one night, a tiny brown sparrow flew inside our house through the front door
A chase ensued
Each time my husband got near to it, the little intruder fluttered away in a desperate search for an exit
Before we could escort it safely outside, the bird toured the house so frantically that we could see its chest throbbing from its rapid heartbeat
Sometimes we are like that little bird anxious, frazzled, and afraid of what might happen next
It comforts me to think that 'not one [sparrow] falls to the ground' without God knowing about it
He sees and knows everything in our world
'The eyes of the Lord are in every place'
, and nothing escapes His attention, including you and me
God understands and values the finest points of our being
Jesus said, 'The very hairs of your head are all numbered'
It's amazing that God keeps a tally of our personal trivia and is even aware of a bird's misfortune
Since He knows about these small details, we can trust that He sees and cares about the big issues that ruffle our feathers
When we ask Him for help, God's response is always informed by His perfect knowledge of us and our circumstances
Let's trust Him with our anxious concerns.
On June 6, 1944, Dwight D Eisenhower, Supreme Allied Commander, was the most powerful man on earth
Under his authority, the largest amphibious army ever assembled prepared to liberate the Nazi-dominated continent of Europe
How was Eisenhower able to lead such a vast army
Part of the answer can be linked to his remarkable skill in working with different kinds of people
What many do not know, however, is that Ike hadn't always gotten along with others
As a boy, he often got into fistfights at school
But fortunately he had a caring mother who instructed him in God's Word
One time, when she was bandaging his hands after an angry outburst, she quoted Proverbs 16:32, 'He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.'
Years later, Eisenhower wrote, 'I have always looked back on that conversation as one of the most valuable moments of my life.'
Undoubtedly, by learning to control his anger, Eisenhower was able to work effectively with others
Inevitably, each of us will at times be tempted to lash out in anger
Yet through God's work in our lives we can learn to control our anger
What better way to influence people than through a gentle spirit.
Early on a sunny Sunday afternoon after church, I headed out for a walk around the neighborhood
A man was trimming his grass along the sidewalk, and we greeted each other with the usual 'Hello, how are you?'
In a negative tone, he replied, 'It's just another Sunday.'
Later, I wondered what he had meant by that
Was he saying, I'm just doing my chores going through the motions
Sometimes even church attendance can become a matter of merely going through the motions on just another Sunday
For the believers in the early church , joining with fellow believers was a source of excitement
That was when the church first started and everyone was a new believer so they were bound to be enthusiastic
But what about us
What can we do to make each Sunday special
Go with the anticipation of meeting with God
While He is with us all the time , God is with us in a unique way as we gather with others who know Him
Bring your burdens and praises to Him
Go to learn about God
We may not learn something new every week, but we can always be encouraged by the truths of God's Word
Expect to hear from Him
Go to fellowship with others
We need each other in this Christian journey
Encourage others, challenge them in their faith, and pray for them
Lord, give us a renewed enthusiasm of heart for attending church, so that it won't be just another Sunday.
Glance at any newspaper and the headlines tell you what's wrong with the world
Watch television, listen to the radio, talk to friends, and you will find no shortage of opinions as to what is wrong on planet Earth
That's because pointing out what's wrong is easy
When terrorists hijacked passenger planes and slammed them into the Pentagon, two New York skyscrapers, and a Pennsylvania field, the world quickly called it evil
The destructive power of this epic evil event made people feel paralyzed and helpless
And that's what evil does best; it makes us feel powerless
But we're not
Most of us experience evil on a smaller, more personal scale
And for us, the apostle Paul outlined the proper response
He said we are to abhor evil , not to repay it with more evil , and not to be overcome by it
The true victim of evil is goodness the goodness that God designed as part of creation for everyone to enjoy
It is surprising then when Paul concludes that the casualty of evil is also its conqueror
Evil gets all the headlines, but God's goodness is stronger, and He wants us to use it on His behalf to overcome His enemy.
In my college years I worked as a guide
I take boys on treks into Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado
On one occasion one of my hikers a small, slow chap lagged behind and took the wrong fork on a trail
When we arrived at our campsite he was nowhere to be found
I frantically went out to search for him
Just before dark, I came across him sitting by a small lake utterly lost and alone
In my joy, I gave him a bear hug, hoisted him on my shoulders, and carried him down the trail to his companions
In a story by Scottish writer George MacDonald, he describes a young woman finding a child alone and lost in the woods
She gathered him up in her arms and carried him home to her father
At which point she gained an insight that was never to leave her: 'Now she understood the heart of the Son of Man, [who came] to find and carry back the stray children to their Father and His.'
I want you too to know the heart of Jesus, the Son of Man, who came to find and carry back His straying children to their Father, 'for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost'
No matter how far you may have strayed and how lost you may be, He came to seek and to save you.
As a result of adult children neglecting their responsibilities, some elderly parents in Singapore are forced to seek financial help from charities and other state agencies
Speaking about this escalating situation, a government official said, 'We cannot legislate love.'
In the Bible, however, love is commanded
That is what Moses told the nation of Israel: 'I command you today to love the Lord your God, to walk in His ways'
And Jesus said that the greatest commandment is to 'love the Lord your God'
How can God command love
His supreme display of love at Calvary gave Him that right
Jesus' beloved disciple, John, wrote: 'By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us
This is His commandment: that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, as He gave us commandment'
What opportunities do you have to obey God's command to love
Honoring parents by caring and providing for them
Ministering to a sick friend
Offering a gracious and kind word to someone who is difficult to love
Lord, because You laid down Your life for us, help us to show love to others.
In November 2008, the US Supreme Court debated the constitutional limits on foul language
The Federal Communications Commission cited a national broadcasting company for allowing two entertainers to use two common profanities on the air
The broadcasting company argued that 'fleeting' profanity that was not blatantly sexual should not be punished
Others countered that it is our duty to protect children from such language
The issue of inappropriate language was not up for debate in the church at Ephesus
Paul instructed believers that one of the ways they were to respond to the blessings of redemption and being made alive in Christ was by guarding their speech
Paul did not want them to be characterized by their old way of living, which included corrupt and unwholesome speech, profanity, malicious gossip, slander, or anything that injures another and sparks dissension
Instead, he wanted the Ephesians through their words to 'impart grace' and encouragement, as the need arose
As followers of Jesus Christ, we want the words that flow from our hearts and out of our mouths to be a life-giving spring
And may all who hear our words receive a blessing.
One of my boyhood hobbies was building model planes
Every time I opened a new box, the first thing I saw was the instructions, but I didn't think I needed to follow them
In my mind I knew exactly how to put the model together
Not until I had glued a few pieces together did I realize I had skipped an important step, like putting the pilot in the cockpit
It's easy to think that we have no need for instructions for our lives, only to later realize that we've messed things up
Which is exactly why Jesus advised that following His instructions is the way for wise people to build a safe, solid, and significant life
He had just told the listening crowd to turn the other cheek, to go the extra mile, to forgive enemies, and to sell treasures so that they could give to the poor
But just getting the instructions isn't enough
The key is to follow them
'Whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock'
Those who don't follow the instructions are, as Jesus put it, 'foolish'
To the world, forgiving your enemies and giving to the poor may seem like a silly way to build a life, but, take it from Jesus, it's the wise way.
On Jack Borden's 101st birthday, he awoke at 5 a.m., ate a hearty breakfast, and was at his law office by 6:30 ready to begin his day
When asked the secret of his long life, the practicing attorney smiled and quipped, 'Not dying.'
But there's more to it than that
Mr Borden, who was baptized at age 11 in the Clear Fork of the Trinity River, told Fort Worth Star-Telegram reporter David Casstevens, 'I'm a firm believer that God has His hand in everything that happens
He is letting me live for some reason
I try to do the things that I believe He wants me to.'
Ezra the priest experienced the 'good hand of his God upon him'
when he led a delegation to Jerusalem to provide spiritual leadership for the former captives who were rebuilding the temple and the city
Ezra found strength and courage in knowing that the Lord was with them each step of the way
'So I was encouraged, as the hand of the Lord my God was upon me; and I gathered leading men of Israel to go up with me'
When we see the Lord's hand in our lives, it brings forth a deep 'Thank You'
and a growing desire to do what He wants us to do.
The radio engineers who work at RBC Ministries were getting ready to broadcast a program via satellite
They had prepared everything, including the satellite link
But just as they were to begin uploading, the signal to the satellite was lost
Confused, the engineers labored to reconnect the link, but nothing worked
Then they got the word the satellite was gone, Literally
The satellite had suddenly and surprisingly fallen from the sky
It was no longer there
I suspect that sometimes when we pray, we think something similar has happened to God that for some reason He isn't there
But the Bible offers us comfort with the assurance that God hasn't 'fallen from the sky.'
He is always available to us
He hears and He cares
In a time of desperation, David wrote, 'Evening and morning and at noon I will pray, and cry aloud, and He shall hear my voice'
No matter when we call on God, He hears the cries of His children
That should encourage our hearts
What was David's response to having a God who hears prayer
'Cast your burden on the Lord, and He shall sustain you'
Although God may not answer as we would like or when we would like, we know that at 'evening and morning and at noon'
He is always there.
Got Botox
A lot of people do
Some take Botox treatments for health matters, but many take them because they want to look young again
Appearance is so important to some Botox users that they allow themselves to be injected with botulinum toxin type A so that their wrinkles will disappear for a while
Later, the treatment must be administered again
Botox is expensive, and it comes with possible negative side effects
But that doesn't stop people from giving it a try so they can look better
Of course, looking good is not a bad thing, but a more important consideration is how we look on the inside
How much are we willing to sacrifice to have beautiful character
Are we willing to take some 'Botox for the soul' to inject ourselves with the kind of loving gentleness, merciful patience, caring interest in others, unselfish kindness, and unity of spirit that can beautify our lives
Are we willing to keep coming back to God for help in getting the spiritual character enhancement we need
Looking for ways to look good
Search the Bible for character-building verses
Then through prayer and the Spirit's empowering, inject the godly traits of those verses into your life
The side effects are all good.
Five-year-old Jenna was not having a good start to her day
Every attempt to arrange the world according to her liking was having the opposite result
Arguing didn't work
Pouting didn't work
Crying didn't work
Finally her mother reminded her of the Bible verse she had been learning: 'Your Word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You'
Apparently Jenna had been thinking about this verse, because she was quick to answer: 'But Mom, it doesn't say that I won't sin; it says that I might not sin.'
Her words are all too familiar
I often hear similar arguments in my own mind
There's something very appealing about loopholes, and we look for them wherever there's a command we don't want to obey
Jesus addressed this problem with religious leaders who thought they had found a loophole in their religious laws
Instead of honoring their parents with financial or material support, they dedicated all their possessions to God, thereby limiting their use
Although their disobedience was not blatant, Jesus said their behavior was unacceptable
Whenever we start looking for loopholes, we stop being obedient.
Our world has become increasingly noisy
But according to a news report, science has found a way to achieve absolute silence: 'Scientists have shown off the blueprint for an '\sacoustic cloak,' which could make objects impervious to sound waves
The technology, outlined in the New Journal of Physics, could be used to build sound-proof homes, advanced concert halls, or stealth warships.'
When we seek out a quiet place for devotional time with God, we may wish we had an 'acoustic cloak.'
But even if we could silence all external sound, the internal noises of worry would still reverberate in our minds
We are told: 'Be still, and know that I am God'
But how do we calm our hearts in practical terms
God understands our dilemma and has provided His own 'acoustic cloak' to quiet our hearts
It involves exchanging our cares for His peace
'Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; 
the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus'
As we place our concerns in God's capable hands, we find a quietness that only He can provide.
During a church leaders' conference at Seattle Pacific University, noted pastor Earl Palmer recalled an experience that shaped his teaching and preaching for half a century
As a seminary student, he led a Bible study where he encouraged the participants to consider the words of Scripture
'I became convinced,' Palmer said, 'that if I could get someone to look at the text, sooner or later the text would win their respect, and it would always point them to its living center: Jesus Christ
And when Jesus Christ has your respect, that's not very many inches away from faith.'
Jesus told a group of religious leaders, who were well acquainted with the Old Testament but violently opposed to Him, 'You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; 
and these are they which testify of Me
But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life'
It requires an open heart as well as an inquiring mind to study the Bible
When we discover Jesus as the Person to whom the entire Bible points, we must then decide how to respond to Him
There is great joy for all who will open their hearts to Christ and find life in Him.
Lauren nervously yet excitedly hopped into a one-person kayak for a white-water rafting experience
After strapping herself in, she headed down the river with a group of kayakers and guides
Lauren became even more nervous when she laid eyes on the falls ahead
Suddenly, as the kayak tossed and turned in the white water, it flipped over
She had been instructed on how to get out quickly if this were to happen
But she became disoriented as she hung upside-down in the water and couldn't find the release bar to get out
She knew she couldn't hold her breath much longer and thought she would soon be in the Lord's presence
Then help came just in time and she was saved
Lauren was very grateful for her rescue from physical death
An even greater rescue has been provided for us rescue from spiritual death has come in the Person of Jesus Christ
While we were drowning in sin, God sent His Son Jesus to bring life through His own death and resurrection
He did so because He is 'rich in mercy' and because of 'His great love'
Out of gratefulness, we can help others by telling them of the Rescuer they so desperately need.
During the high schoolers' spring ministry trip to Jamaica, they visited a home for troubled teens who had run afoul of the law or whose families could not handle them
This was not a comfortable situation for the kids from either culture
What would they say
How would they connect
It didn't take long to find out
Minutes after they arrived, a soccer match began as a number of the US students engaged some of the Jamaican teens in spirited competition
The soccer match was a great icebreaker as the kids kicked the ball around and got to know each other
After the game, conversation was easier and friendships were established more quickly because of a common interest
In Acts 17, the apostle Paul demonstrated how to break through barriers and establish dialogue
He talked with the Athenians about something of common interest worship
In a similar way, we can use sports talk with a co-worker or lawn conversation with a neighbor
The possibilities are endless
To reach out to people who need to hear about God's love, look for common language and watch the barriers fall.
Robert Lowry felt that preaching would be his greatest contribution in life
However, this 19th-century pastor is best remembered for his gospel music and hymns
Lowry composed words or music for more than 500 songs, including 'Christ Arose,' 'I Need Thee Every Hour,' and 'Shall We Gather at the River'
In 1860, as the United States teetered on the brink of civil war, Lowry wrote these enduring words that focus not on threatening circumstances but on the unchanging Christ:
What though my joys and comforts die
The Lord my Savior liveth
What though the darkness gather round
Songs in the night He giveth
No storm can shake my inmost calm 
While to that refuge clinging
Since Christ is Lord of Heav'n and earth
How can I keep from singing
Lowry's confidence in God during difficult times echoes the psalmist's words:
'Do not put your trust in princes, nor in a son of man, in whom there is no help
Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God'
Whether we react to life with faith or fear depends on our focus
Knowing that 'the Lord shall reign forever' , how can we keep from singing?
When the Pharisees came to Jesus with the woman caught in adultery and asked Him what should be done with her, He knelt for a moment and scribbled in the sand
We have no idea what He wrote
But when they continued asking Him, Jesus responded in one short sentence: 'He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first'
His few words accomplished much in confronting the Pharisees with their own sin, for they walked away one by one
Even today those words resound around the world
Jesus had such a closeness to and dependence on His Father that He said of Himself, 'Whatever I speak, just as the Father has told Me, so I speak'
Oh, that we had such a relationship with our Father that we knew how to respond with His wisdom
Perhaps it begins with obeying James' challenge to be 'swift to hear, slow to speak'
This is not the slowness of ignorance, emptiness, timidity, guilt, or shame
But the slowness of wisdom born of dwelling quietly on the Lord and His thoughts
We're often told to stop and think before we speak
But I think we should take it much further and live a life where we're always listening for God's wisdom.
Everything was quiet in our yard
While I worked at the patio table, our dog, Maggie, lay nearby in the grass
A slight rustling of dry leaves changed everything
Maggie made her move, and suddenly she was circling a tree, where a woodchuck clung tightly to the trunk
Maggie came when I called, but I couldn't get her to look at me
Her neck was in a rigidly fixed position
Although she was near me physically, her thoughts and desires were with that woodchuck
Maggie and the woodchuck remind me of how quickly I become preoccupied with things that take my eyes off Jesus
Old temptations, new responsibilities, or ongoing desires for possessions or pleasure can quickly divert my attention from the One who knows and wants what is best for me
A similar spiritual condition afflicted the Pharisees
They were serving in the temple and instructing others, but their hearts were far from God
We too can teach and serve at church but be far from God
Even our religious activity becomes meaningless when our focus is not on Jesus
But if we stop being 'stiff-necked'
, the Lord can turn our eyes away from worthless things and revive our hearts.
We know we're getting older when we say things like, 'Can you believe how young those professional baseball players are?'
And it's a sure sign of aging when we no longer ask, 'How are you?'
but say, 'Hey, you look terrific'?, as if we're surprised
Aging is inevitable
Unfortunately, society has taught us to fear advancing age and to disguise its reality as much as possible
But aging can actually be a wonderful thing
Followers of Jesus have the capacity to get significantly better with age
As Paul put it: 'Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day'
Just as there are physical signs that reveal we're getting older, there are signs that show we are getting better
Rather than becoming more crotchety, intolerant, and unloving, the maturing follower of Jesus grows better at forgiving, loving, and caring
Growing older is a continuation of the journey to become more like Jesus, which means that as time goes on our heart and attitudes should increasingly resonate with and reflect the compelling character and winsome ways of our Savior
So as we grow older, let's embrace the opportunity to become spiritually more like Jesus
Our friends will notice that we look better with age.
Diana and Dave love to ride their jet skis on the lake, skimming across the water on warm sunny days
But one morning the weather was cool and mostly cloudy, and Diana couldn't convince Dave to go out
So she went on her own
It was so cold that she flitted back and forth across the lake, trying to keep herself in the sunshine for some needed warmth
But every time she reached a sunny area, the clouds moved and it quickly turned to shade
Realizing the futility and silliness of chasing the sunshine, she finally gave up because it didn't bring her what she wanted
King Solomon did another kind of chasing that couldn't bring him satisfaction
In the first 11 verses of Ecclesiastes 2 alone, he mentions that he chased after pleasure, laughter, wine, wisdom, houses, gardens, money, possessions, and music
But his evaluation was that 'all was vanity and grasping for the wind
There was no profit under the sun'
Those pursuits were empty 'vanity of vanities'
He wisely concluded: 'Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is man's all'
Are you chasing after some of the same things that Solomon was
It's a vain pursuit
Purpose and satisfaction come only from knowing and obeying God.
A poet once wrote: 'As a rule, man's a fool
When it's hot, he wants it cool
And when it's cool, he wants it hot
Always wanting what is not.'
What an insightful observation on human nature
So when we read in Philippians 4:11, 'I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content'
we wonder, Can this be possible
For Paul it was
Philippians 4:12-13 describes Paul's response to life: 'I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty
I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want
I can do everything through Him who gives me strength'
Paul's relationship with God superseded whatever he did or did not have
His contentment was not based on his circumstances, but on his relationship with Christ
Paul reminds us that contentment doesn't happen overnight
It's something that we learn
As our relationship with God develops over time and through experiences, we learn to trust God more and ourselves less
Paul knew that Christ would give him the strength to persevere in whatever situation he encountered
No matter what you're facing today, through prayer you can receive the strength to be content.
Addie was a bit worried
Before we all sat down for Sunday dinner, someone had started eating
That's when our 3-year-old granddaughter said, 'We haven't prayed yet.'
She was concerned that we might forget to give thanks
Her concern was a good sign
It showed that at her young age, Addie was beginning to form one of those good habits that parents teach their children as part of their instructions for life
This little routine, for instance, helps her see the value of prayer and thanksgiving, which can be a powerful resource for her in the years ahead
Raising children in an age of hostility toward the Christian faith is not easy
Parents wonder how best to help their little ones learn to trust the Savior and live to please Him
Proverbs indicates that a key to directing children is through purposeful instruction by parents on such things as listening to wisdom , seeking discernment , understanding the fear of the Lord , recalling parents' teaching , and gaining insight
These become habitual when parents give instruction and when children 'retain'
those words of teaching
Got kids or grandkids
It's never too early to begin instructing them in wise living.
The Narnia children's books written by C S Lewis symbolize Christian truth
In the tale Prince Caspian, Lewis tells the story of a tyrant who usurped the throne of the enchanted land of Narnia
His young nephew, Prince Caspian, has heard stories of Narnia's great king who died and rose again to break the power of evil
His uncle dismisses this story as a fairy tale
However, the boy later discovers that the ancient story is in fact true
Lewis' intent was to illustrate how skeptics often dismiss the ancient story of Christ as a myth
But, like biblical scholars today, Lewis was convinced that based on the historic evidence, the record of Jesus' supernatural life is true
Sir Frederic Kenyon, former director of the British Museum, held a similar conviction about Scripture's reliability
Of this he wrote, 'Both the authenticity and the general integrity of the books of the New Testament may be regarded as established.'
The apostles had the same confidence in the record of Jesus: 'We did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty'
We can be assured that the biblical account of the King of kings is an accurate historical record.
When people say with a sigh, 'Promises, promises,'
it's often when they've been disappointed by someone who failed to keep a commitment
The more it happens, the greater the sadness and the deeper the sigh
Have you ever felt that God doesn't keep His promises
It's an attitude that can subtly develop over time
After God promised Abraham, 'I will make you a great nation'
, 25 years elapsed before the birth of his son Isaac
During that period, Abraham questioned God about his lack of a child , and he even resorted to fathering a son through his wife's handmaiden
Yet, through the ups and downs, God kept reminding Abraham of His promise to give him a child, while urging him to walk faithfully with Him and believe
When we claim one of God's promises in the Bible, whether it is for peace of mind, courage, or provision of our needs, we place ourselves in His hands and on His schedule
As we wait, it may at times seem as if the Lord has forgotten us
But trust embraces the reality that when we stand on a promise of God, He remains faithful
The assurance is in our hearts, and the timing is in His hands.
While browsing through some birthday cards in a gift shop, I found one that made me laugh
Its message read: 'You are only young once, but you can be immature forever.'
That card tickled my funny bone
There is something winsome about never having to grow up, as any fan of Peter Pan can attest
But we all know that perpetual immaturity is not only inappropriate, it's also unacceptable
For the Christian, it's vital that we mature
After we are born again and become followers of Christ, we are not expected to stay spiritual babies
The Scriptures challenge us to grow to be more like Him
When writing to the church at Corinth a church with many problems Paul said that their issues were rooted in a lack of spiritual development
In 1 Corinthians 3:1, he said, 'I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual people but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ.'
How do we grow beyond being just spiritual babes
Peter urged, 'Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ'
We do this by meditating on the Word of God and devoting ourselves to prayer
Like the troubled church of Corinth, it may be time for us to grow up.
Mozart is revered as a genius of musical composition
In one instance, he was even inspired by the melody of a bird
Mozart had a pet starling whose song so fascinated him that some say he wrote a piece of music based on the melody he heard in the bird's chirps
Birds were also an inspiration to the psalmist
In Psalm 104, he praises God for caring for the living creatures He put on the earth
Included in his observations are birds who fly in the heavens above, perch in the branches of trees, and sing songs of heartfelt joy: 'The birds of the heavens have their home; they sing among the branches'
Nature filled the psalmist's heart with praise to God, and I think that must have included the musical sounds of the birds
Often the marvels we see in creation prompt us to worship
This theme is repeated throughout Scripture: 'The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His handiwork'
Creation's stimulus to praise need not be limited to the visual
It can also be widened to include hearing nature's songs
As we go about our daily routine, we can tune our hearts to the melodies God has placed in His creatures and let them serve as an added springboard of praise to the Creator.
Summer is my favorite season
I love the leisurely days when I can set aside some of my routines without feeling guilty
Doing new things, seeing new places, and allowing myself the time to take 'the scenic route' revive my spirit and renew my enthusiasm for life and work
But summer can also be a dangerous time of breaking good habits
Certain routines are good
They increase our efficiency and ensure that important things get done
After all, we need to have fixed times and places for certain things or the world would be chaotic
Creation is designed to operate on schedule, and, as part of it, so are we
We need food and sleep at regular intervals
We sometimes hear legitimate warnings about allowing routines to turn into ruts
But the Bible indicates that having set times for certain things is good
David indicated that morning was the right time for him to praise God and ask for His direction
And Daniel prayed three times a day, and not even the threat of death made him change his routine
While enjoying carefree days, we must not become careless about spending time with God
Savoring spiritual sustenance is a routine for all seasons.
A few years ago, the banking empire Citicorp ran a series of billboards about money: 'Money changes hands just be sure it doesn't change the rest of you!'
and 'If people say you're made of money, you should work on your personality!'
These ads gave a refreshingly new perspective on riches
God also has a surprising spin on wealth
From His perspective, you can be 'well off'
when it comes to worldly treasures and yet be in dire poverty in your soul
Or you can be poor in terms of earthside stuff and be lavishly rich by God's standards
The distorting power of wealth reminds me of the story of the rich young ruler
After a discussion about eternal life, Jesus asked him to sell his possessions, give to the poor, and follow Him
Unfortunately, the man 'went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions'
This prompted Jesus' lesson to the disciples: 'How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!'
It's not that Jesus is against wealth
It's just that He is grieved by anything that we value more than Him
We can work hard and make money, but when those things are the main pursuit of life, then Jesus isn't
Placing Him first and foremost in our lives is the key to true prosperity.
You have to work hard to offend Christians
By nature, Christians are the most forgiving, understanding, and thoughtful group of people I've ever dealt with
They never assume the worst
They appreciate the importance of having different perspectives
They're slow to anger, quick to forgive, and almost never make rash judgments or act in anything less than a spirit of total love
No, wait I'm thinking of Labrador retrievers
I laughed when I read this humorous thought by David Learn in an e-mail
But having had experience with retrievers and fellow Christians I think it's true that sometimes believers are just too easily offended
'The choir director always gives her the solos.'
'The pastor didn't even look at me when he shook my hand.'
'I do a lot around here people ought to appreciate me a little more.'
Anger Resentment Pride
Sure, issues between believers do sometimes need to be addressed
But what if we always tried to treat others the way we want to be treated , weren't quick to judge others but forgave them , and demonstrated a little humility
And what if the world could actually recognize that we are followers of Jesus by the love we have 'for one another'?
Is this true of us?
Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina is a spectacular waterfall system of 275 falls along 2.7 km of the Iguazu River
Etched on a wall on the Brazilian side of the Falls are the words of Psalm 93:4, 'Mightier than the thunders of many waters, mightier than the waves of the sea, the Lord on high is mighty!'
Below it are these words, 'God is always greater than all of our troubles.'
The writer of Psalm 93, who penned its words during the time that kings reigned, knew that God is the ultimate King over all
'The Lord reigns,' he wrote
'Your throne is established from of old; You are from everlasting'
No matter how high the floods or waves, the Lord remains greater than them all
The roar of a waterfall is truly majestic, but it is quite a different matter to be in the water hurtling toward the falls
That may be the situation you are in today
Physical, financial, or relational problems loom ever larger and you feel like you are about to go over the falls
In such situations, the Christian has Someone to turn to
He is the Lord, 'who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think'
for He is greater than all of our troubles.
My wife and I don't always under- stand each other
For instance, it's a great mystery to her how I can watch an entire baseball game between two teams that have no chance of making the playoffs
And I surely don't understand her love of shopping
To love someone intensely doesn't mean you have to understand him or her completely
That's good news, because there's no way we can begin to grasp the deep mysteries of the God we love
With our finite minds and our self-centered views, we can't deduce why God does what He does
Yet some people look at tragedies, for instance, and turn their backs on God assuming that their finite knowledge about the situation is better than His infinite wisdom
Indeed, if we could figure God out if He were no more than a glorified human with no greater knowledge than that of the smartest person where would be the awe and the majesty of the Almighty
One reason we know God to be so great is that we cannot reduce His thinking to ours
The apostle Paul asked, 'Who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct Him?'
Clearly, the answer is no one
Praise God that even when we don't understand Him, we know we can trust Him.
Long ago my wife decided that driving within the speed limit gives her a wonderful sense of freedom
She tells me, 'I don't ever need a radar detector
And I never have to slow down when I see a state patrol car or worry about paying a fine for speeding.'
Even on long trips when the miles seem to grind slowly along, she sets the cruise control at the posted speed limit and enjoys the journey
'Besides,' she reminds me, 'it is the law.'
Romans 13:1-10 addresses our responsibility to the authority of human government and to the law of God
When we obey the governing authorities, we don't have to fear punishment, and we gain a clear conscience by doing what is right
Paul urged the followers of Christ in Rome to give the governing authorities what was owed them, whether taxes, revenue, respect, or honor
But he went beyond human regulations when he wrote: 'Owe no one anything except to love one another
for he who loves another has fulfilled the law'
It is our duty to obey man's law and our privilege to fulfill God's law by loving others
And His law is 'the perfect law that gives freedom'
When I heard that David was in the office for a board meeting, I was excited
He and I had a mutual friend, Sharon, who had died several years earlier
We had a few minutes to reminisce about her and her love for life and God
What a delight to connect with someone who has loved someone you have loved
There's a special bond because you love to talk about that cherished person
Those who know Jesus Christ as their Savior have even stronger ties
We are forever connected to Him and to one another
'We, being many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another,'
Paul says in Romans 12:5
We've been 'born of God,'
and we love those who are 'begotten of Him'
When we get together with fellow believers, we have the opportunity to talk about the one we love Christ and of the love, forgiveness, and grace we have experienced in Him because of His death and resurrection
At such times, we can encourage each other to continue to trust Him and spur one another on to be faithful in our walk with Him
This coming Sunday and throughout the week, let's remind fellow believers of all that Jesus has done and of how truly wonderful He is.
As we sat at the table one day last week, my oldest son began protesting about his little sister 'always' copying him
When she imitates his laugh or eats her French fries before her burger like he does, it annoys him
My wife and I tried to get him to realize that he has an opportunity to influence her by setting a good example
Unlike my son, Paul invited others to copy his example
In this verse, he concluded his discussion from chapter 10 about the Corinthians loving others enough to limit their freedom
He said that when they were invited to a nonbeliever's home for dinner, they were free to eat what was set before them
But if their freedom to eat the meat offered to idols caused another believer to question whether or not what they were doing was right, they were to limit their freedom for the good of the 'weaker' believer
Paul encouraged the people to follow his example in this matter, in the same way he followed Christ's example
Paul did not seek his own good, but the good of others by imitating Jesus' example of love, unity, acceptance, and sacrifice
In the same way, we are to follow Jesus' example so closely that we can say with confidence to our brothers and sisters, 'Copy me as I copy Christ.'?
Think about how good it will feel when it stops hurting,' said my father
I received this advice from Dad often while I was growing up, usually after some minor bump or scrape had resulted in a major dramatic reaction
At the time, the advice didn't help
I was incapable of focusing on anything other than my pain, and loud wails accompanied by buckets of tears seemed the only appropriate response
Through the years, however, Dad's advice has pulled me through some truly miserable situations
Whether it was the pain of a broken heart or the misery of a drawn-out illness, I would remind myself: Now is not forever
The confidence we have as Christians is that God has something good planned for us
Suffering was not part of His original act of creation, but it serves as a temporary reminder of what happens in a world where God's order has been broken
It also motivates us to spread the word about God's plan to redeem the world from the suffering caused by sin
Although we cannot avoid pain and disappointment , we know that it's only temporary
Some sorrow will be relieved in this life, but all of it will be relieved when God finally and firmly establishes His new heaven and new earth
Now is not forever.
Isaac Hann was a little-known pastor 
He served a small church in Loughwood, England, in the mid-18th century
At the close of his ministry, the membership of the church numbered 26 women and 7 men
And only 4 of the men attended with any regularity
In this age of mass media and mega-churches, who would consider this a successful work
In our world today, Isaac Hann would be considered one of those pastors who never quite 'made it.'
He certainly wouldn't have been invited to speak at pastors' conferences
He would not have written articles on church growth
Yet, when he died at 88 his parishioners placed a plaque on the wall of their meeting house
The plaque remains to this day
It reads in part: Few ministers so humble were, yet few so much admired: Ripened for heaven by grace divine, like autumn fruit he fell;  Reader think not to live so long, but seek to live as well
First Peter 5:5-6 comes to mind: 'God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble
Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time.'
Reverend Isaac Hann 'made it big'
in a way that matters humility before God and a reward in heaven
We can too.
During one of my daily walks, I inadvertently walked through a small tornado of little insects
I didn't think much of it at the time, but later on I found all kinds of bites on my ankles and arms
It seems I had walked through a swarm of gnats, whose bites led to uncomfortable itching and sores
This experience gave me a new perspective on the plague of gnats that God visited upon Egypt when Pharaoh would not free the Israelites
The Hebrew word translated 'lice' in Exodus 8:16-18 can also mean 'gnats' or 'mosquitoes.'
Because the insects are compared to the sand of the desert, a swarm of gnats seems the most likely
The pagan priests of Pharaoh who prided themselves in their frequent washings and shavings were now covered with numerous insect bites
God had designed this plague to get Pharaoh to repent and let Israel go, but instead he hardened his heart
Is God trying to get your attention through some circumstances in your life
Is He trying to persuade you to get back in step with Him
We should resist the urge to harden our hearts
But let's instead submit to God and ask Him what spiritual lessons He wants us to learn.
Recently I was in a crowded shopping area when I saw a woman plowing her way through the crowd
What intrigued me was the message on her T-shirt, which read in bold capital letters, IT'S ALL ABOUT ME
Her actions reinforced the words on her shirt
I'm afraid she's not alone
That message is declared by so many men and women today that it could be the motto of our modern world
For followers of Christ, however, that statement simply is not true
It is not all about us it's all about Jesus Christ and others
The apostle Paul certainly felt the weight of this reality
He was so concerned that his fellow Israelites would know Christ that he said, 'I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my countrymen according to the flesh'
That is a remarkable statement
Far from thinking it was all about himself, Paul affirmed that he would willingly exchange his eternity for theirs
Paul's teaching is a refreshing reminder of self-sacrifice in a challenging world that is destructively self-centered
The question we must ask is: Is it all about me
Or is our life about Jesus Christ and the people He came to reach
Think about it
What's it all about?
During a January research trip to Germany, I was dismayed to learn that we would be staying at a monastery
I pictured an austere place with no heat, cold stone floors, and hard beds
Instead, I found a warm, welcoming, comfortable room
My colleague said, 'The monks believe in treating their guests as they would treat Christ.'
Though they don't live in such comfort themselves, they are content
Robert Herrick, a 17th-century English poet, wrote: Christ, He requires still, wheresoe'er He comes, To feed, or lodge, to have the best of rooms: Give Him the choice; grant Him the nobler part Of all the house: the best of all's the heart
It may seem easier to welcome Christ into our heart than to open our life to others
Whether it's a room in our home or time in our schedule, too often we treat people as intruders rather than guests
The apostle Peter wrote: 'Above all things have fervent love for one another, for '\slove will cover a multitude of sins.'
Be hospitable to one another without grumbling'
We honor Christ by giving Him the best room, our hearts, and by offering willing hospitality to others.
In March 2009, a 62-year-old woman was charged with stealing more than $73,000 from her church in the state of Washington
When the detectives interrogated her, she told them: 'Satan had a big part in the theft.'
It sounds like she was saying that the devil made her do it
Satan may have played a role in her choices, but she has some faulty thinking about temptation and sin
The devil tempts believers, but he doesn't make us sin
James tells us that God isn't to blame either: 'Let no one say when he is tempted, '\sI am tempted by God'; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone'
He is good and holy
So who is to blame for our sin
James says, 'Each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed'
Just as a fisherman uses bait to lure his prey, so our own evil, unchecked desires lead to giving in to temptation and sin
When we disobey God by sinning, let's not shift the blame or justify our actions with the faulty 'the devil made me do it' theology
Instead, let's take full responsibility for our actions, confess our sins to a gracious and forgiving Father, and pursue right living again.
I still find it amazing that we can launch probes into deep space
But think of how wasteful it would be if on the way to Mars our probe got caught in the gravitational pull of a lesser, insignificant object
Beware, That might be happening in our lives
When Jesus called His disciples to follow Him, He meant for them to begin a journey to passionately pursue Him
Followers of Christ have been launched into a trajectory that is defined by drawing closer and closer to Him
But in the process, we are often distracted and succumb to the gravitational pull of lesser, alluring things
When that happens, we cease our pursuit of Him and go into orbit around stuff that in the end is empty and unsatisfying
Psalm 63 is the cure for lives stuck in orbit
David pursued God, knowing that He alone could satisfy his inner longings because His 'lovingkindness is better than life'
The joy of God's presence consumed every moment: 'When I remember You on my bed, I meditate on You in the night watches'
David understood that true joy and purpose come not in admiring God from a safe distance, but from chasing hard after Him
Let's get back on track and pursue an increasingly closer walk with God!
The H1N1 pandemic focused the world's attention on viruses
Viruses are living organisms that need a host to survive and wreak their havoc
In some cases, a virus can be present for many years before the host is even aware of it
During that time, the virus can inflict widespread and untold damage
Take it away from the host, and it remains dormant or dies
In a similar way, sin needs a host to stay alive
By themselves, sins such as pride, greed, anger, and selfishness are mere words
But when sin overpowers a human host, it works to destroy it for as long as the host is alive
Thankfully, because of Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross, Christians have been positionally 'set free from sin'
Even though we still sin, the Holy Spirit who lives in us helps us to resist that 'sin virus,' the lust of the flesh
The apostle John tells us: 'Those who have been born into God's family do not make a practice of sinning, because God's life is in them'
Now we walk in dependence upon the Spirit, and one day we will stand 'faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy'
Isn't that a great comfort for you as you step out today into a world infected by the 'virus' of sin
A friend who is a commercial pilot told me about a flight in which he encountered a serious mechanical issue, a problem with dangerous implications
When the situation occurred, the warning lights in the cockpit informed him of the problem
and he monitored it all the way to the destination, ultimately landing safely
Once on the ground, the pilot immediately went to the maintenance staff and reported it
To his surprise, the mechanics responded, 'We already know about the problem and are ready to fix it
When you got the cockpit warning, we automatically got an electronic warning as well.'
As he shared that incident, I couldn't help but compare it to Jesus' words about our heavenly Father: 'Your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him'
He said this in contrast to people who believe that they must 'use vain repetitions
For they think that they will be heard for their many words'
Jesus presupposes God's knowledge of and concern for His children
Even though God knows our needs, He still wants us to share our hearts with Him
He stands ready to hear our prayer and to repair our brokenness by His grace.
I don't know about you, but I tend to enjoy getting credit when I do stuff for others
And I don't think I'm alone in appreciating thank you cards and words of gratitude
I also know, however, that there's something to be said for anonymity
This must be a good way to give, because Jesus endorsed it
That's why I was impressed with a gift that arrived anonymously on our front porch one day
We had been out of town; and when we returned, there stood several flower pots each holding a blooming sunflower
We knew the reason they were left on our doorstep on the birthday of our late daughter, Melissa, who loved sunflowers
Someone was telling us, 'We remember Mell.'
By giving anonymously, they focused completely on our family rather than on themselves
Imagine a world in which we all gave generously and selflessly
Jesus mentioned secret giving in Matthew 6
He said, 'When you do a charitable deed, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
That your charitable deed may be in secret
Realistically, we can't always give anonymously
But our giving should always be marked with the same spirit of selfless humility and God-directed charity.
On the day of His resurrection, Jesus appeared to His disciples and showed them His hands and feet
We are told that at first they could not believe for joy it appeared too wonderful to be true
Thomas was not with the disciples, but he also had trouble believing until he saw for himself
When Jesus appeared to Thomas and told him to put his fingers in the nail holes and his hand in His side, Thomas cried, 'My Lord and my God!'
Later, as Paul told the Philippians of his own suffering, he also declared Jesus as Lord
He testified that he had come to the place where he considered all his experiences as loss 'for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord'
You and I have never seen Jesus calm a storm or raise someone from the dead
We haven't sat at His feet on a Galilean hillside and heard Him teach
But through eyes of faith we have been spiritually healed by His death on our behalf
Thus we can join Thomas and Paul and countless others in acknowledging Jesus as our Lord
Jesus said, 'Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed'
When we believe, we too can call Jesus, 'My Lord and my God!'?
The other day I ran across a troubling report about people who think it is acceptable to use the ocean as a giant garbage dump
Here is an excerpt: 'If you should see this amazing floating pile of plastic in the Pacific Ocean, it's called '\sThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch.' 
It features three million tons of plastic debris floating in an area larger than Texas
An eye-popping 46,000 pieces of plastic float on every square mile of ocean!'
Other sources estimate the amount of garbage is even bigger
Plastic is especially bad because it does not dissolve
During our sojourn on earth, we have been charged, like Adam, with taking care of the earth and its creatures that God has given us
Genesis 2:15 says, 'The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to tend and keep it.'
God delights in what He has made and this extends to the sea and all that live in it
This world should remind us of the greatness of our Creator and serve as a springboard of praise to Him
Indifferently using it as a garbage dump mars its beauty and threatens the creatures that live here
Showing respect and caring for the land, the ocean, and the air is our duty as believers in Christ.
I was excited about going to the baseball park to watch the Detroit Tigers play the Chicago White Sox
I proudly put on my Tigers T-shirt that morning before going to the opposing team's stadium
But I had to wear a sweatshirt over my team's shirt because it was cool outside
So I was disappointed that no one at U.S
Cellular Field could see which team I was there to cheer for
No one knew I was a Tigers' fan
After a 3-hour rain delay, the game finally started and I could cheer for my team and get my loyalty out in the open
The apostle Paul had a loyalty that was most definitely out in the open a loyalty to Jesus Christ
He wrote to the believers in Rome, 'I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ'
He knew that the gospel was 'the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes'
because Jesus had dramatically changed his life and its direction
In his preaching and witnessing, he proclaimed Jesus, the One to whom he had given his whole life
The believers in Rome were also known for their allegiance to Christ
Paul said of them: 'Your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world'
Is your loyalty to Jesus out in the open?
If you've ever tried to fix something and failed, you'll appreciate the sign I saw outside an automotive repair shop: We Will Fix What Your Husband Fixed
Whether the problem is the car, the plumbing, or an appliance, it's usually better off in the hands of someone who is skilled and trustworthy
So it is with the sin and the struggles within us that resist our efforts to mend them
Jeremiah denounced the greedy prophets and priests of his day who 'healed the hurt of [God's] people slightly, saying '\sPeace, peace!' when there is no peace'
They could neither change themselves nor lead the people to spiritual transformation
So the Lord called the people to follow His way: 'Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where the good way is, and walk in it; then you will find rest for your souls'
Centuries later, Jesus, the Son of God, said: 'Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest'
The parts of our lives that we have tried and failed to repair can be restored by the hand of God
Through faith in Christ, we can be made whole.
When young Kofi came home after Sunday school, his mother asked him what he had learned that morning
His quick reply spoke volumes: 'Obedience again!'
Although I'm many years older than Kofi, I agree that obedience to God is a lesson that we must, sometimes reluctantly, learn over and over again
Oswald Chambers wrote: 'The Lord does not give me rules, but He makes His standard very clear
If my relationship to Him is that of love, I will do what He says
If I hesitate, it is because I love someone I have placed in competition with Him, namely, myself.'
When we are obedient, we show God that we love Him and have more faith in Him than we do in ourselves
Arthur W
Pink said that love is 'a principle of action, and it expresses itself
by deeds which please the object loved.'
To obey God means to relinquish what we want and to choose to do what He asks
God requires the obedience of His followers, and Jesus placed great importance on it
He asked, 'Why do you call Me '\sLord, Lord,' and not do the things which I say?'
And He issued this challenge: 'If you love Me, keep My commandments'
Erin's life was so different from that of most 8-year-olds
While other kids were running and playing and eating ice cream, Erin was lying in a bed being fed through a tube, able to see only the brightest lights and hear only the loudest sounds
Her life consisted of needles and nurses and hospital visits as she battled ongoing illnesses and profound disabilities
Surrounded by a remarkable family who cared for her with compassion and filled her life with love, Erin died before reaching her ninth birthday
What can be learned from a precious child like Erin, one who never spoke a word or colored a picture or sang a song
A friend of Erin's family put it best: 'We are all better for having had Erin in our lives
She taught us compassion, unconditional love, and appreciation for the little things.'
Children such as Erin also remind us that this world is not reserved for the perfect, the wealthy, or the athletic
Each person, no matter their physical, mental, or emotional condition, is created in the image of God and is of equal value and significance
Our Lord has compassion for the weak, the broken, and all He has made , and we should mirror that concern
Is there an 'Erin'
in your life you can learn from?
Over and over again, my driver's education instructor said these two words: 'Drive ahead.'
This was his way of telling me to focus on the horizon, not just on my immediate surroundings
Drivers who continually look to the right or to the left may well go into the ditch
Satan is good at causing 'roadside distractions'
that tempt us to look at him rather than at Jesus
If he can get our attention, he may be able to get us off track and delay our spiritual progress
He even tried this with Jesus Himself
After Jesus was baptized, Satan tried to deter Him by suggesting 'better'
ways to accomplish His work
Satan told Jesus that He could prove He was the Son of God by throwing Himself from the temple
But Jesus knew that proving He was God's Son would come by submitting Himself to the cross, not by flinging Himself from a high building
He responded, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God'
Jesus had His eyes on our redemption, and He knew He couldn't accomplish it by taking a detour around the cross
The way to stay out of spiritual ditches is to fix our eyes on Jesus and refuse to even glance at Satan's distractions.
The book The Preacher and the Presidents chronicles the ministry of evangelist Billy Graham
Spanning presidents from Harry S
Truman to George W
Bush, Graham often had an open door to the White House
Yet despite his unusual sphere of influence, Graham repeatedly credited the grace of God working through him for his influence, not any personal talent he might possess
The apostle Paul was another believer who was called to witness to people in high authority
Christ said of Paul, 'He is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name before Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel'
In Acts, we read that Paul's sphere of influence included rulers such as Felix, Festus, Herod Agrippa, and perhaps Caesar himself
But as Billy Graham would do centuries later, Paul pointed to the grace of God working through him: 'Not I, but the grace of God which was with me'
You may not be called to proclaim the gospel to heads of state, but God has placed people in your life with whom He wants you to share His message of hope
Why not pray for opportunities for God's grace to flow through you as a witness to someone in your sphere of influence?
While walking through a home-improvement store, I saw a man wearing a bright red T-shirt bearing this melancholy message: 'Confidence: The feeling you have just before you understand the situation.'
I laughed at this humorous concept, but I also realized that the shirt carried a sane and sound warning
It's a reminder to all of us who try to get things done through confidence in our own ability or credentials but without consciously trusting in the strength of God
If we think we can accomplish life's tasks in our own strength, that false confidence will inevitably become our undoing, and we'll collapse under the weight of our own failings
Paul wrote to the Corinthians about this by recalling ancient Israel's penchant for self-confidence and self-sufficiency
He described everything the Israelites thought they had going for them; then he told how they had turned those benefits into a license to sin and an almost arrogant confidence that would prove to be their undoing
Paul said their self-confidence should warn us
His conclusion
'Let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall'
Psalm 118:8 shows us the best way: 'It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man,'
or in ourselves
Where is your confidence?
The first people to climb Mt Everest, the world's highest mountain, were Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953
Hillary was just 33 years old
His feat afforded him fame, wealth, and the realization that he had already lived a remarkable life
So, what did Hillary do for the next 55 years
Did he retire and rest on his laurels
Absolutely not
Although Hillary had no higher mountains to climb, that didn't stop him
He achieved other notable goals, including a concerted effort to improve the welfare of the Nepalese people living near Mt
Everest, a task he carried on until his death in 2008
Did you know that God told the Levites to retire from their regular duties at age 50
But He did not want them to stop helping others
He said that they should 'minister with their brethren to attend to needs'
We cannot take this incident as a complete teaching on retirement, but we can see a godly implication that continuing to serve others after our working days are over is a good idea
Many people find that when they retire they have nothing meaningful to do with their time
But as the Levites and Sir Edmund Hillary did, we can refocus when we retire, giving of our time to help others.
When my kids were young, I thought they would be impressed with what few accomplishments I may have had, that they would read my books and be impressed by my speaking engagements
But then I discovered that they hadn't read any of my books and had no idea where I had been on a speaking gig
When my oldest son finally read one of my books, he told me that the only reason he read it was so that I would stop telling people that my children have never read my books
Let's face it, for the most part, kids are not impressed with our accomplishments
So the only way to bridge the gap is to meet them where they are, to get into their world, like getting into a game of Chutes and Ladders or playing catch in the backyard
Jesus did this with us
John said of Jesus, 'the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory'
In other words, He stooped down to our level when He came to this earth, which led to His greatest accomplishment of all: bridging the gap between His world and ours once and for all
Only then could we begin to understand how worthy He is of our utmost adoration and praise!
The words grace and peace are found in all of Paul's greetings in his New Testament letters to the churches
And in his letters to Timothy and Titus, he also includes mercy: 'Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord'
Let's examine each of these words
Grace is what our holy God gives that we, as sinful people, don't deserve
In Acts 17:25, we learn that 'He gives to all life, breath, and all things.' His gifts include our very next breath
Even in our darkest hour, strength is given by God so that we can endure
Mercy is what God withholds that we do deserve
In Lamentations 3:22, we read, 'Through the Lord's mercies we are not consumed.'
Even when we're wayward, God gives time and help for us to turn back to Him
Peace is what God brings to His people
Jesus said: 'Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you'
Even in the worst of times, we have inner tranquillity because our God is in control
We can be encouraged that throughout our lives the Lord will give us the grace, mercy, and peace we need to live for Him.
The ancient road from Jerusalem to Jericho is a narrow, treacherous path along a deep gorge in the Judean wilderness
Its name is Wadi Kelt, but it's known as the valley of the shadow, 
for this is the location that inspired David's 23rd Psalm
The place itself offers little reason to compose such a hopeful poem
The landscape is bleak, barren, and perilously steep
It's a good place for thieves, but not for anyone else
When David wrote, 'Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil'
, he was in a place where evil was an ever-present reality
Yet he refused to give in to fear
He wasn't expressing hope that God would abolish evil so that he could pass through safely; he was saying that the presence of God gave him the confidence to pass through difficult places without fear of being deserted by Him
In another psalm, David said that the Lord was his hope
Many claim to have hope, but only those whose hope is Christ can claim it with certainty
Hope comes not from strength, intelligence, or favorable circumstances, but from the Lord
As Maker of heaven and earth, He alone has the right to promise hope and the power to keep the promise.
After being diagnosed with terminal cancer, 47-year-old Randy Pausch returned to Carnegie Mellon University to deliver a final lecture to colleagues, students, and friends
The professor of computer science thought that perhaps 150 people might show up Instead the 400-seat auditorium was packed
For an hour, Randy opened his heart to them in a humorous, insightful, and moving farewell that was focused more on living than dying
Within weeks, the videotaped lecture had been seen by millions on the Internet and later became the seed of a bestselling book
Those facing death often have an unusually clear perspective on what is truly important in life
The apostle Paul's last farewell has inspired countless followers of Christ through the centuries
'The time of my departure is at hand,'wrote Paul
'I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith'
Paul's instruction to Timothy spans the ages to challenge us as well
The letter begins and ends with God's grace and in between is a celebration of the unceasing faithfulness of God
A message from the dying can give purpose to the living
Paul's triumphant finale, 'To Him be glory forever and ever'
, is a message we can all live by.
One of our grandchildren is allergic to several kinds of foods
Milk, cheese, eggs, and ice cream are among the items she has to avoid
Even a small amount of these things is detrimental to her health
She's not alone in being required to avoid certain things in life
While her allergies are related to her physical well-being, each of us as believers in Jesus has dangers we need to stay away from to maintain spiritual health
Scripture gives us a clear indication of what we are 'allergic to' spiritually
Every kind of evil
This should cause us to think about the choices we make, because taking part in what is clearly evil is not good for our spiritual vitality
Foolish disputes and arguments
This takes discernment, for some arguments have merit in defending the faith
But those for which there is no answer or which have no bearing on truth only cause dissension
Sexual immorality
The Bible says that any sexual activity outside the boundaries of a marriage between a man and a woman is immoral
Are we willing to make the effort to steer clear of things we are spiritually 'allergic to'??
When Jesus commanded, 'Judge not,'
He was not implying that we should be naïve or imprudent
Of course we need to think critically and analytically in this world where we are often confronted with error and wrongdoing
Instead, He meant that we should not be condemning or accusing, a point Paul made eloquently: 'Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the counsels of the hearts'
Poet Robert Burns made a similar point, writing of those whose actions are in doubt: 'One point must still be greatly dark, the [motive]
Why they do it.'
No one knows another's motives
God alone can bring to light what is hidden in darkness; He alone can expose the intentions of the heart
Jesus knows the latent forces that motivate others: the cruel beginnings, the fear, the disappointment, the broken heart, the sin that is resisted
Moreover, He is working in every submissive heart to bring it to maturity
Thus in the end, quite often contrary to our expectations, He will bring praise to those He has brought to completion
The Lord alone can try the heart
Until He returns, let's ask Him to help us examine our own.
On a recent flight, I got ready to do some work
Spread out on my tray were my laptop computer, backup hard drive, iPod, and other gadgets that are part of being a 21st-century 'road warrior.'
As I worked, a young man seated beside me asked if he could make a comment
He told me how inspirational it was for him, a young man, to see someone my age so enthusiastically embracing modern technology
In spite of his intention to compliment me, I suddenly felt about 120 years old
What did he mean by 'someone my age'?
I wondered
After all, I was 'only' 57
Then I remembered Psalm 71, the psalm for folks 'my age' and beyond
It reminds us of the value of a life well lived and of the worth of lessons learned: Lessons are not just for our benefit but also for us to pass along to the next generations
The psalmist wrote, 'When I am old and grayheaded, O God, do not forsake me, until I declare Your strength to this generation, Your power to everyone who is to come'
So, maybe being 'someone my age' isn't such a bad gig
It is the privilege of 'veteran' Christ-followers to declare the strength and power of God to the younger generations
That's how we can truly be inspirational to them.
If you're like me, you love a good deal
Not just bargain shopping, but when you manage to cut a great deal for yourself without giving anything up in return
So if you can identify with these kinds of deals, you'll understand the prodigal son's scheme when he decided to return home
There were three kinds of servants in those days: day workers who were paid on a day-to-day basis; hired servants who worked long hours on the estate but lived in town with their independence intact; or bond servants who lived on the estate and gave all of themselves to serving the family
When the prodigal son hit rock bottom, it's interesting that his planned apology involved asking if he could be like a hired servant
Why not a grateful bond servant
Some commentators suggest that perhaps he was trying to negotiate a deal, a way to get a paycheck and keep his independence as well
Often we approach God like, 'I'll serve You but You can't take away my freedom.'
It may seem like a good deal at the time, but God's deal is so much better
Just like the boy's father, His arms are ready and willing to receive repentant sinners as part of His family
There could be no better deal and no better way to serve Him!
Francis Chan, in his book Crazy Love, tells of a family with an interesting Christmas tradition
On Christmas morning, the Robynson family doesn't focus on opening presents under the Christmas tree
Instead, they make pancakes and coffee, and serve the breakfast to the homeless
This is a small but creative way to show God's love and generosity to the poor
God expected this kind of generosity from His people
In Deuteronomy 15, Moses emphasized the reality of poverty and how the more affluent must deal with it
They were warned of four dangers: A hard heart, ignoring the needs of the poor
A closed hand, withholding what the poor lacked
An evil thought, hesitating or refusing to loan money to the poor because the year of canceling debts was nearing
A grudging spirit, a reluctance to satisfy the needs of the poor among them
Not only were they warned about selfishness, but more important, they were encouraged to be spontaneously generous
Among God's people, there must always be a spirit of generosity toward the poor
Let's open our hearts and our hands.
The miracles that God worked through Moses challenged the many gods of Pharaoh
Yet, in another time, there was a Pharaoh who promoted the belief in one deity
Pharaoh Akhenaten pointed to the rising and setting sun as the great deity who gave life to the earth
His religious symbol for Aton, the sun god, was represented by a single disc of light with emanating rays
Though this Pharaoh's idea came closer to the one God of the Bible, it was still idolatry
When Paul addressed the people in Athens, he was grieved by the idolatry in that city
Yet he used the people's imperfect understanding of God to point them to the God of Scripture
Of their efforts in trying to find God, Paul said: 'God, who made the world and everything in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands'
In our increasingly pluralistic world, the people around us may worship a multiplicity of deities
Yet their spiritual journey need not end there
We never know when someone might be moving toward the kingdom of God
Following the example of Paul, we should respect a person's religious background, watch for spiritual receptivity, and then point him or her to the one true God of Scripture.
Just after we moved to a house in a new neighborhood, we invited my sister-in-law and her husband over for Sunday dinner
As we were greeting Sue and Ted at the door, an odd noise directed their eyes toward the kitchen
As I followed their gaze, I froze in horror
An errant hose of our old portable dishwasher was whipping about like the trunk of an angry elephant, spewing water everywhere
Sue went into action mode
Dropping her purse, she was in the kitchen before me, shutting off the water and calling for towels and a mop
We spent the first 15 minutes of their visit on our knees mopping the floor
Sue is a doer, and the world is a better place because of the doers of the world
These are the people who are always ready to pitch in, to be involved, and even to lead if necessary
Many of the doers of the world are also doers of the Word
These are the followers of Jesus who have taken the challenge of James to heart: 'Be doers of the Word, and not hearers only'
Are you doing all that you know God wants you to do
As you read God's Word, put what you've learned into practice
First hear, then do
God's blessing comes as a result of our obedience .
While making his landmark documentary about World War II, filmmaker Ken Burns and his colleagues watched thousands of hours of military footage
Scenes of the devastating Battle of Peleliu often invaded their dreams at night
Burns told Sacramento Bee reporter Rick Kushman, 'You're listening to the ghosts and echoes from an almost inexpressible past
If you do that, you put yourself into the emotional maelstrom.'
There's a price to becoming involved in the struggles of others, whether artistically or spiritually
Paul experienced this in his work of sharing the gospel: 'Apart from such external things, there is the daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches
Who is weak without my being weak
Who is led into sin without my intense concern?'
Oswald Chambers said we enter this spiritual struggle as we 'deliberately identify ourselves with God's interests in other people'
and 'find to our amazement that we have power to keep wonderfully poised in the center of it all.'
Paul realized that God's strength is made perfect in our weakness
Jesus paid the greatest price to be involved in our world, and He strengthens us as we share His love with others.
There was a time when a certain West Coast city may have been one of the most hostile places to the gospel in America
Posters in coffee shops advertised witchcraft meetings where you could learn to cast a spell on your enemies
It was such a challenging environment for churches that they struggled to get building permits from the city council
And there was a lot of 'woe is me' talk among church leaders
Until a group of pastors began to meet to pray regularly and then decided to take the love of Jesus into their city
They started a ministry to the homeless, to those suffering with AIDS, to teens at risk
Faithfully and intentionally they brought the love of Jesus to the needs of hurting people
Before long, the city agencies started calling on them for help
Better yet, the churches started growing as people responded to the gospel in action
Which proves the point: Sometimes you've got to 'show up' before you speak up
No one really wants to hear what we have to say about the love of Jesus until they've seen it in our lives
Then even the most ardent opponents to the gospel may just be glad you're in their town, their office, or their neighborhood
And then you just might be able to tell them about Jesus.
News that a solar eclipse would take place on July 22, 2009, brought an alarming prediction
It was predicted that the eclipse would sufficiently affect gravitational pull, causing tectonic plates to 'pop a seam,'
resulting in a sizable earthquake and a subsequent devastating tsunami in Japan
The US Geological Survey responded that no scientists 'have ever predicted a major earthquake
They do not know how, and they do not expect to know how, anytime in the foreseeable future.'
There have also been many false predictions about the date of Christ's second coming, despite our Lord's emphatic words: 'But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only'
Christ told His followers that instead of trying to predict the date of His return, they should 'watch' and 'be ready'
Peter warned, 'The day of the Lord will come like a thief.'
Then he added: 'What kind of people ought you to be You ought to live holy and godly lives'
Striving to live for God, that's what Jesus wants us to focus our energy on while we wait for that 'blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ'
Sometimes I wonder why God didn't list the Ten Commandments in reverse order, since the 10th commandment correlates to the first sin, desire
Eve's sin wasn't simply her desire for a piece of fruit; it was the desire for knowledge that Satan told her would make her like God
Eve's covetousness caused her to violate both the first and tenth commands that God later gave to Moses
When we don't covet, we pretty much eliminate our reasons to disobey the other commands
Wanting what isn't ours causes us to lie, steal, commit adultery, murder, and refuse to honor our parents
We refuse to rest because we can't get what we want in 6 days of work
We misuse God's name when we use it to justify something that we want to do
We make gods out of wealth and relationships because we don't want to have to put all our trust in God
I have a hard time coming up with sins that don't involve some form of covetousness
Yet because it's the last in the list, we tend to think of it as being the least important
But it's not
When we stop sin while it is still in our hearts and heads, we avoid making others the victim of our sin, and we avoid many of the serious consequences of sin.
Abel doesn't seem to fit in the first half of Hebrews 11
He's the first 'ancient' listed, but his story isn't like the others mentioned there
Enoch went to heaven without dying
Noah saved mankind
Abraham started a people group
Isaac was a noted patriarch
Joseph rose to the top in Egypt
Moses led the greatest exodus ever
Clearly, their faith was rewarded
By faith, they did what God asked, and He poured out blessings on them
They saw God's promises fulfilled before their eyes
But Abel, The second son of Adam and Eve had faith, and what did he get for it Murdered
That sounds more like the folks in verses 35-38, who found that trusting God doesn't always lead to immediate blessing
They faced 'mockings,'imprisonment, and being 'sawn in two.'
'Thanks, but no thanks,' we might say
We would all prefer to be heroic Abraham instead of someone 'destitute, afflicted, tormented'
Yet in God's plan, there are no guarantees of ease and fame even for the devout
While we might experience some blessings in this life, we may also have to wait until 'something better' comes along, the completion of God's promises in Glory
Until then, let's keep living 'by faith.'?
A friend told me about his church's leadership retreat
For 2 days, church leaders pulled away for a time of prayer, planning, and worship
My friend was not only refreshed but also energized
He told me, 'This retreat is really going to help us move forward as a church ministry.'
It sounded funny to me, this notion of retreating in order to move forward
But it is true
Sometimes you have to pull back and regroup before you can make meaningful forward progress
This is particularly true in our relationship with God
Jesus Himself practiced 'retreating forward.'
After a busy day of ministry in the region of the Sea of Galilee, He retreated
Matthew 14:23 tells us that 'when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray
Now when evening came, He was alone there.'
Alone in the presence of the Father
In this fast-paced, get-ahead world, it's easy to wear ourselves down, pressing ahead and moving forward at all costs
But even in our desire to be effective Christians, we must consistently be willing to retreat into God's presence
Only in the refreshing of His strength can we find the resources to move forward in our service for Him
Retreat in Jesus before moving forward.
In 1776, the 13 British colonies in North America protested the limitations placed on them by the king of England and engaged in a struggle that gave birth to a brand-new republic
The infant nation soon adopted that now-famous document known as the Declaration of Independence
Almost 2,000 years ago, the Lord Jesus cried out on the cross, 'It is finished,' proclaiming the believer's 'declaration of independence.'
All of humanity was under the tyranny of sin and death
But Christ, the sinless One, took our place on Calvary and died for our sins
Having satisfied God's righteous demands, He now sets free for eternity all who trust in Him
Paul wrote, 'Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us'
Romans 8 assures us, 'There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death'
Galatians 5:1 urges all who have been redeemed to 'stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free.'
We are thankful to God for any freedom we enjoy in a nation
But above all, believers everywhere can praise Him for the freedom that is found in Christ!
One of my earliest childhood memories was watching snails in our backyard flower garden
I was fascinated by this little creature with a shell, a slimy little tummy, and tiny eyes that turned like periscopes
But what really seemed unusual was how slowly a snail travels
How slow does a snail go
One study clocked a snail at 0.00758 miles per hour, or 40 feet in one hour
No wonder we use the phrase moving at a snail's pace to mean 'slow.'
Although a snail does move at a 'sluggish' pace, one virtue it does possess is perseverance
The great 19th-century preacher Charles Spurgeon wryly observed, 'By perseverance the snail reached the ark.'
According to the apostle Paul, perseverance is a key component in character development
He explained that 'tribulation produces perseverance'
And upon that building block go character and hope
The original Greek word translated 'perseverance'
means 'steadfastness, constancy, and endurance.'
It was used of believers who endured in their walk of faith despite many painful trials
Have setbacks slowed you down to a snail's pace
Be encouraged
God doesn't ask for a fast finish
He expects persevering progress.
Hans Geiger, Marie Curie, Rudolf Diesel, Samuel Morse, and Louis Braille share something in common
They all invented or discovered something significant that bears their name
Their names, along with many others, appear in the 'Encyclopedia Britannica's Greatest Inventions,' a list of '325 innovations that have had profound effects on human life.'
We who follow Christ bear His name
In Luke's record of the early church, he said: 'The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch'
Later, Peter urged the early believers not to be ashamed of suffering as 'a Christian'
The term Christian, once directed at Jesus' followers in scorn, was embraced by them as a badge of honor, a mark of allegiance to Him
E M Blaiklock, former Chair of Classics at the University of Auckland, wrote that in the first century the term Christian had 'a certain appropriateness, for it implied loyalty and acceptance of a person, and that person, the Messiah
The true modern use of the word follows the same tradition
The Christian is one who accepts, with all its implications, the lordship of Jesus Christ.'
As followers of Christ today, we gladly bear His name as our Savior, Lord, and Friend.
I was worrying about a few things as I sat in my car under a shade tree at lunchtime
Then a robin, with a fat worm dangling from its mouth, landed near my door and looked up at me
The robin was a vivid reminder to me of Jesus' words in Matthew 6:25-26, 'Do not worry about your life
Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them
Are you not of more value than they?'
Years ago, in an article in the Denver Seminary magazine Focal Point, Paul Borden gave some helpful suggestions for worriers: Start a worry list
Write down what you're worried about
The bills, Your job, Your children or grandchildren, Your health, The future
Turn your worry list into a prayer list
Ask the Lord to work in those situations you're concerned about
Pray specifically for your needs and depend on Him
Turn your prayer list into an action list
If you have any insight that there's something you can do about your cares, do it
As we turn our worries into prayer and action, Borden says, 'Paralyzing anxiety can be replaced by concern for the responsibilities of life.'
Why not start your list right now?
A South African man surprised nine men robbing his home
Seven of the robbers ran away, but the homeowner managed to shove two into his backyard pool
After realizing that one of the robbers couldn't swim, the homeowner jumped in to save him
The Cape Times reports that once out of the pool, the wet thief called to his friends to come back
Then he pulled a knife and threatened the man who had just rescued him
The homeowner said, 'We were still standing near the pool, and when I saw the knife I just threw him back in
But he was gasping for air and was drowning
So I rescued him again.'
In his letter to the Colossians, the apostle Paul wrote of another rescue:God the Father had saved them from the domain of darkness
This rescue occurred at the death of Christ, but also at the Colossians' conversion
The imagery Paul used suggests that believers have been rescued from the dark reign of Satan by being transferred as free people into the peaceable rule of Christ
By Jesus' death, believers become free citizens in the kingdom of light
The appropriate response to such amazing grace is to show joyous gratitude by offering God acceptable service with reverence and awe .
According to a long-held Christian tradition, the apostle Paul was beheaded and buried in Rome around ad 67
In 2009, scientists conducted carbon dating tests on what many believe to be his remains
While these tests on the bone fragments confirmed that they date from the first or second century, positive identification remains in question
But no matter where Paul's bones rest, his heart lives on through his letters in the New Testament
While imprisoned in Rome, Paul wrote to the followers of Jesus in Philippi about his purpose in life
He spoke of his 'earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death
For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain'
As we read Paul's words today, they challenge us to examine our own hearts
Are we as passionate as he was about Jesus Christ
Is it our goal to honor Him in our everyday life
Long after we're gone, those who knew us will remember our hearts
May we, like Paul, create a legacy of hope and encouragement centered around Jesus Christ.
Picher, Oklahoma, is no more
In mid-2009, this once-bustling town of 20,000 went out of business
In the first quarter of the 1900s, Picher was a boomtown because of its abundant lead and zinc
Workers extracted the ore, which was used to help arm the US during both World Wars
The town faded as the ore began to run out, but the biggest problem was that while the lead and zinc brought wealth, they also brought pollution
Because nothing was done to deal with the pollution, Picher became a toxic wasteland, and the government condemned the land
What happened to Picher can happen to people
Prosperity can look so good that it's hard to think about possible downsides
Actions that are detrimental to long-term spiritual health are accepted, and unless the problem is corrected, destruction follows
It happened to King Saul
He began as a good king, but in seeking success he failed to see the damage he was doing
Turning his back on God's commands, he acted 'foolishly' and lost his kingdom
In our attempts to find success, we need to watch out for spiritual pollution that comes when we fail to follow God's clear scriptural guidelines
Godly living always beats toxic living.
Have you ever been really thirsty
Years ago, I visited my sister Kathy in Mali, West Africa
During an afternoon of seeing the sights, the temperature had risen far above 100ºF
Parched, I told her, 'Hey, I need something to drink.'
When Kathy told me she had forgotten to bring along a supply of filtered water, I began to get a bit desperate
The longer we drove, the more I wondered what it was like to truly die of thirst
Finally, Kathy said, 'I know where we can go,'as she drove up to the gate of an embassy
Inside I beheld the most beautiful sight, a water cooler
I grabbed one of the tiny paper cups and filled it again and again
My body had been deprived too long and now required lots of liquid to reverse the effects of dehydration
The psalmist compared physical thirst with spiritual thirst: 'As the deer pants for the water brooks, so pants my soul for You, O God'
His thirst was that of a desperate longing for God, the one and only living God
Do you long for something this world can't provide
This dissatisfaction is a thirst of the soul for God
Run to the One who alone can quench that thirst
'He satisfies the longing soul, and fills the hungry soul with goodness'
A man was filling out a job application when he came to the question 'Have you ever been arrested?'
He wrote, 'No.'
﻿The next question, intended for people who had answered 'Yes'
to the previous question, was 'Why?'
The applicant answered it anyway: 'I never got caught.'
He evidently knew he was guilty of plenty
So was the apostle Paul
He knew he had personally done wrong and sinned against God
He wrote, 'I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man'
He even called himself the 'chief'\s'
of sinners
We too were once separated from the Lord because of our sin and were considered His enemies
But when we confessed our sin and acknowledged our need for His forgiveness, He cleansed us and made us new
Those of us who have known the Lord for many years may have the tendency to forget what we've been rescued from and forgiven of
Sharing about our past and current failures and giving praise to God for forgiveness will help us not to come across as 'holier-than-thou' to people who don't yet know the Lord
The truth is we've all been guilty of plenty, and God deserves the glory for His mercy toward us.
The film Miracle tells the true story of the 1980 US Olympic ice hockey team as it marches to an improbable gold medal
At the outset of the story, coach Herb Brooks is shown selecting the players for his team
When he gives assistant coach Craig Patrick a list of names he has chosen, Craig says in surprise, 'You're missing some of the best players.'
Brooks responds, 'I'm not looking for the best players, Craig, just the right ones.'
Brooks knew that individual talent would take the team only so far
A willingness to fit into his style of selfless play would be far more important than talent
Clearly, team success, not individual glory, was the priority
The biblical call to service has a similar emphasis
In God's purposes, each believer does his or her part, but the results are team-oriented
After explaining the wide differences in the spiritual gifts of believers, Paul says, 'the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all'
When we use the skills God gives us, His purposes are accomplished, and He gets the glory
In God's service, it's not about being the best, the most talented, or the most gifted
It's about being the right people, the ones God 'set in the body, joining together to serve the same team.
When the Los Angeles Times covered a 2008 conference championship soccer match between two Christian schools, Azusa Pacific University and Westmont College, it was about far more than winning the game
Three days earlier, a wildfire had swept through the Westmont campus, destroying several academic buildings, faculty homes, and student rooms
Unable to host the game, the rules required Westmont to forfeit
Instead, Azusa invited their opponents to play at their campus where they welcomed Westmont fans with free admission and lunch
On the field, Westmont won an emotional 2-0 victory, while Azusa Pacific won admiration for their good will
LA Times reporter Bill Plaschke wrote: 'Rarely in Southern California sports has there been a better show of sportsmanship than this, 
Azusa Pacific sacrificing its chance at a title defense to give Westmont a fair shot at taking it 
As impressive as the resilience of the conquerors was the kindness of the conquered.'
So often we think only of money when the Bible calls us to give willingly and bountifully, 'for God loves a cheerful giver'
Giving others a chance and offering hospitality to those who hurt is generosity that makes winners of everyone involved.
The buttercups in our backyard were unusually bright and beautiful due to the generous amount of spring rain God sent our way
I wanted to take some pictures of them before they faded, 
but I had trouble getting close enough because they were growing in a very soggy wetland
One sunny afternoon, I pulled on a pair of boots and trudged through briers and brambles toward buttercup bog
Before I got any pictures, I got muddy feet, multiple scratches, and numerous bug bites
But seeing the buttercups made my temporary discomfort worthwhile
Much of life is about 'getting through' the trials and troubles that are inevitable in our sinful world
One of these trials is persecution
The disciples certainly found this to be true
They knew the good things that Jesus has ready for those who follow Him, but they met harsh resistance when they tried to tell others
Those of us who have chosen God's way, and who know from experience that it's 'a more excellent way' , will persevere even when we have to go through danger and difficulty
By doing so, we show others a beautiful picture of God's peace, mercy, and forgiveness
The joy that awaits will make our temporary discomfort worthwhile.
In a commentary on Ecclesiastes 9:15, Martin Luther cites the story of Themistocles, the soldier and statesman who commanded the Athenian squadron
Through his strategy, he won the Battle of Salamis, drove the Persian army from Greek soil, and saved his city
A few years later, he fell out of favor, was ostracized by his countrymen, and was banished from Athens
Thus, Luther concludes, 'Themistocles did much good for his city, but received much ingratitude.'
The crowd, for some reason, seems to ignore or quickly forget the good that the poor and humble man accomplishes through his wisdom
No matter 'Wisdom is [still] better than strength' even if 'the poor man's wisdom is despised'
It's better to be a quiet, honest sage who, though forgotten, leaves much good behind, than a swaggering, strident fool who, though many applaud him, 'destroys much good'
Accordingly, what matters in the end is not the recognition and gratitude we receive for the work we've done, but the souls of those gentle folk in whom we've sown the seeds of righteousness
Put another way: 'Wisdom is justified by all her children'
Whom have you influenced through your wise and godly wisdom?
Last spring the window to one of the rooms in our house was repeatedly attacked by a robin
The bird would perch at the base of the window, ruffle its feathers, chirp loudly, and then fly headfirst into the glass
I did some research and learned that robins are territorial
While nesting, they drive out any competing robins
This bird apparently saw its reflection in our window and thought it was another robin
The threat was not real; it was only an illusion
In the Old Testament, we see an instance when Jacob imagined a threat that wasn't really there
Years earlier, Jacob had stolen his brother Esau's blessing by their father
Now, after many years of separation, they were going to meet again
Jacob thought Esau would harm him, so he sent gifts ahead as a peace offering of sorts
Then, when he saw Esau approaching with 400 men, Jacob panicked
Yet what Jacob thought was an attack force turned out to be a welcoming committee
'Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept'
In interpersonal relationships, we sometimes misinterpret a situation
We must ask the Lord for discernment so we don't miss a friendship because of an imaginary threat.
In the US, more long distance calls are made on Mother's Day than any other day
But on Father's Day, the most collect calls are made
It seems that children still depend on their fathers to provide, even when they are far away from home
Fathers are needed and wanted for much more than financial help
While 1 Thessalonians 2:10-12 is primarily directed toward church leaders, Paul talks about how their role is similar to a father's
He states: 'You know how we exhorted, and comforted, and charged every one of you, as a father does his own children.'
Exhorted is 'to call near.'
It is easy for fathers to think that all that's required of them is to bring home a paycheck
But children need their close encouragement
The word comforted is 'to console.'
Nothing is more valuable to a child than the time given by a father to listen and talk
Without constant relating, relationships turn cold
Charged is 'to affirm.'
Fathers challenge their children by affirming the truth of God's Word as they live it out in front of them
And even in failings, they affirm what is right through the asking of forgiveness
How thankful we can be for fathers who help their children 'walk worthy of God'
On October 19, 2008, I heard the news that Levi Stubbs, lead singer for Motown's vocal group The Four Tops, had died at age 72
As a boy, I enjoyed the Four Tops, especially Stubbs' emotion-filled, passionate voice
I had never met him or heard the group in concert, 
yet his passing affected me at an unexpected level
Behind my sadness, I think, was the reminder that I too am getting older
The death of someone I listened to when I was young reminded me that time isn't marching on, it's running out
In the only psalm attributed to Moses, he wrote, 'The days of our lives are seventy years; and if by reason of strength they are eighty years, yet their boast is only labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away'
Those aren't words we want to hear
We want to remain forever young, 
but Scripture reminds us that the years pass and death will one day arrive
That leaves us to wrestle with two essential questions: Am I ready to 'fly away' at life's end, having trusted Christ as my Savior
And am I using my fleeting days to please the One who loves me eternally
How are you doing, no matter what your age, with the challenges raised by the brevity of life?
During the worldwide financial crisis of 2008, a widow lost a third of her income when her bank stocks no longer paid dividends after her trusted bank failed
The Wall Street Journal quoted her tearful response as an example of the feelings of many people who were similarly affected: 'You just think, '\sThis can't be happening.' What is secure anymore?'
Tragedy and hard times always jolt our thinking
Our best plans and hopes can be shattered by events beyond our control
We are reminded that there is only one source of true security in a changing world
With new appreciation, we consider Paul's words: 'Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to trust in uncertain riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy
Let them do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share, storing up for themselves a good foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life'
When our resources diminish, we can grow richer in good works, generosity, and sharing with others
If financial stability returns, we can hold more loosely what we are given, trusting solely in God
We are secure in Him alone.
Jesus taught that the world seen from God's viewpoint is tilted in favor of the oppressed
This teaching emerges in the Sermon on the Mount and other statements of Jesus: the first will be last , and he who humbles himself will be exalted
But why would God single out the oppressed for special attention
1 Suffering helps us realize our urgent need for redemption
2 Suffering helps us experience our dependence on God and our interdependence with one another
3 Suffering helps us distinguish between necessities and luxuries
4 Suffering helps us respond to the call of the gospel because we may have become so desperate that we cry out to God
The poor, the hungry, the mourners, and those who suffer are blessed because their lack of self-sufficiency is obvious to them every day
They must turn somewhere for strength
People who are rich, successful, and beautiful may go through life relying on their natural gifts
But people who are needy, dependent, and dissatisfied with life are more likely to welcome God's free gift of love
'Blessed are the poor in spirit.'
Why
Because 'theirs is the kingdom of heaven'
It was just a speck, a tiny foreign object flying through the air on a windy day while I was cutting the grass
Somehow that speck made its way into my left eye
For the next few hours that little speck caused quite a bit of irritation
I tried washing it out
My wife, Sue, a nurse, tried everything she could think of
Finally, we went to a Med Center, 
where the medical personnel on duty couldn't get it out either
Only after applying some ointment and waiting several more annoying hours did I get relief from the speck
This tiny, nagging irritant made me think anew about Jesus' teaching in Matthew 7 about criticizing others
My first thought was to be impressed with the practicality of Jesus' illustration
Using the effective literary tool of hyperbole, or exaggeration, He explained for His listeners how foolish it is for a person to criticize someone without seeing that he or she is also guilty of error
If you can find someone else's little speck while ignoring the hunk of wood in your own eye, something's wrong
It should be unthinkable to ignore our own faults while pointing out someone else's
An attitude of self-righteousness has no place in the Christian life
That should be plain to see.
In the spring of 2009, Susan Boyle took the stage of Britain's Got Talent
Compared to the other contestants, she was plain-looking
No one expected much when she raised the microphone to her lips
But then she began to sing
Spellbound, the judges were clearly taken with the beauty and power of the voice that filled the auditorium as the audience stood to their feet cheering with delight
All were surprised that such a rivetingly beautiful song came from such an unlikely source
All of us can be unlikely sources when it comes to the beauty of Jesus flowing out of us
But that is how He planned it
Common folk like you and me take turns on the stage of life in front of the world's skeptical audience so that our friends, family, and all who fill the arena of our lives will see and hear the love and grace of Jesus Christ emerging from our lives
I love Peter's reminder that we are 'a people for His own possession, that [we] may proclaim the excellencies of Him who called [us] out of darkness into His marvelous light'
You might think you're an unlikely source, but when you allow the Lord to flow through you, the watching world will stand up and take notice.
People tend to remember negative images more than they do positive ones, according to an experiment conducted at the University of Chicago
While people claim that they want to turn away from the barrage of bad news in the media, reports on tragedies, diseases, economic downturns, this study suggests that their minds are drawn to the stories
Catherine Hankey was more interested in the 'good news.'
She had a great desire to see young women come to know Christ
In 1866, she became very ill
As she lay in bed, she thought about all those with whom she had shared the story of Jesus' redemption, and she wished that someone would visit and comfort her with 'the old, old story.'
That's when she wrote the poem that later became a hymn, 'Tell Me the Old, Old Story'?
Tell me the story slowly, that I may take it in,   That wonderful redemption, God's remedy for sin
Tell me the story often, for I forget so soon;  The early dew of morning has passed away at noon
We never tire of hearing the story that because of His great love God sent His one and only Son to this earth
He lived a perfect life, took our sin upon Himself when He was crucified, and 3 days later rose again
When we receive Him as our Savior, we are given eternal life and become His children
Tell someone the old, old story of Jesus and His love
They need some good news.
In the award-winning film Chariots of Fire, one of the characters is legendary British sprinter Harold Abrahams
He is obsessed with winning, 
but in a preliminary 100-meter dash leading up to the 1924 Olympics, he is soundly beaten by his rival, Eric Liddell
Abrahams' response is deep despair
When his girlfriend, Sybil, tries to encourage him, Harold angrily declares, 'I run to win
If I can't win, I won't run!'
Sybil responds wisely, 'If you don't run, you can't win.'
Life is full of reversals, and we as Christians are not excluded from disappointments that make us want to give up
But in the race that is the Christian life, Paul challenges us to keep running
He told the Corinthians, 'Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize
Run in such a way that you may obtain it'
We are to run faithfully, Paul is saying, spurred on by the knowledge that we run to honor our King and to receive from Him an eternal crown
If we falter in our running, if we quit serving God or give in to sin because of our difficulties, we risk losing a rich reward we could have received had we run our best
Sybil was right
'If you don't run, you can't win.'?
This idea of being careful with language is important in Bible study as well
Paul described this process as 'rightly dividing the Word of truth'
The phrase translated 'rightly dividing'
was used of a skilled craftsman cutting something straight
In the context of Bible study, it means taking the time for diligent and careful study, while prayerfully asking for the Holy Spirit's guidance
It means teaching the truth directly and correctly
Accurately discerning and passing on God's truth must be the priority of every conscientious believer.
